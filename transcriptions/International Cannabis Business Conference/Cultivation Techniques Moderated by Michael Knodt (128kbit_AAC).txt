[SPEAKER_00]: Give a round of applause for this panel
and for yourselves for making it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: last panel of the ICBC, second one in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, our next panel is going to go
over cultivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important because without the
farmers, without the cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry really doesn't go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to introduce the moderator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow Cannabis News online,
you've definitely seen his byline in many
[SPEAKER_00]: German and English publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including writing for Scentsy Seeds,
for weed maps at marijuana.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for a little publication called Weiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm welcome for Mika Knoll.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the warm applause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the panel today, or our panel,
will be dedicated to growing techniques.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever tightening regulations and oversight
related to cultivation innovation,
[SPEAKER_06]: our panel of elite industry scientists and
growers will discuss topics ranging from
[SPEAKER_06]: regenerative farming and breeding to
organic pesticides and microbiological
[SPEAKER_06]: screening methods as they relate to more
stringent and evolving testing
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ICBC invited five leading experts,
but I have to admit, due to unforeseeable
[SPEAKER_06]: circumstances, we are only four people
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom could not come.
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmer Tom could not come.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he says hello to the audience for the
ICBC, and sorry that he could not come.
[SPEAKER_06]: But still I think we have four leading
experts from the growing industry who can
[SPEAKER_06]: give us a very unique or very good insight
into the legal cannabis industry in the
[SPEAKER_06]: USA and in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am proud to introduce like people
from Florida, from big companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: people from the grassroots movement,
people from our growers from the science.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also not only about growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also about science and research about
cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to start with Pete.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Pete.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pete is a co-owner of Root Rx.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a recreational marijuana dispensary
with six locations across the Rocky
[SPEAKER_06]: Mountains in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pete brings 30-plus years of growing
knowledge to his current profession from
[SPEAKER_06]: his involvement in operating indoor and
outdoor cannabis grows across the country
[SPEAKER_06]: for recreational and medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has experience working with traditional
and alternative growing mediums and
[SPEAKER_06]: running operations that use both natural
and artificial light.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to the growing side of the
cannabis business, Pete has deep
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding of the retail aspect for
managing stores in Aspen and Vail,
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: He brings a comfortable and relaxed
attitude to a high-pressure industry and
[SPEAKER_06]: his welcoming qualities make him an
approachable resource for all things about
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my first question, Pete.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Germany, the regulations for growing in
medical cannabis do not allow to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: medical cannabis in greenhouses or even
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: According to Colorado requirements,
can you fulfill the standards for
[SPEAKER_06]: medical-grade cannabis in greenhouses or
even outdoor?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how can you achieve that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been growing in greenhouses now
since 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we have found is that in a
high-tech, energy-efficient greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we now have, that these things are
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are regulated by several bodies in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're regulated by the Marijuana
Enforcement Division, which gives us
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing and sets fines.
[SPEAKER_02]: and fees as far as infractions of rules in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also regulated by the Department
of Agriculture at a state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also regulated by the Health and
Safety Department for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And between these three entities,
we have to adhere to very high standards
[SPEAKER_02]: of microbial contaminations, microbial
poison as far as pesticides and those
[SPEAKER_02]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because this is food stuff,
because we're feeding people this and
[SPEAKER_02]: people are inhaling this, we're held to a
very high standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess my point being is that in the
right greenhouse environment, we can
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve the same level of quality and the
same standards that you would in a
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Germany, I guess you folks are not able
to grow in greenhouses yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see that as an evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point in the next several
years, you're going to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado right now, because it is so
competitive, there are so many growers in
[SPEAKER_02]: the market, it all gets down to cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point in time, you're going to
realize that greenhouses and outdoor grows
[SPEAKER_02]: for especially oils and extracts and that
type of thing are the only way that you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: survive the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that answered it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for the insight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I come to Colin now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin, hello, Colin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin's co-founder and co-inventor of
Chief Growth Officer at GrowthSentia.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's completed his studies in soil
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, complicated work for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a research scientist at Colorado
University, Colin published dozens of
[SPEAKER_06]: peer-reviewed publications that were
focused on microbial mediated processes
[SPEAKER_06]: that enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry that I have to read that from the
document.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin left his academic position at
Colorado State University in March 2015
[SPEAKER_06]: and launched GrowthSentia.
[SPEAKER_06]: GrowthSentia is a young startup company in
the AG tech sector that develops microbial
[SPEAKER_06]: and soil additives that sustainably
increase plant yield across many crops,
[SPEAKER_06]: which in easy words is to say,
you develop products that replace
[SPEAKER_06]: fertilizer and that replace artificial
fertilizing and fertilizing in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my first question is, may I ask you
to explain that in easy words,
[SPEAKER_06]: you replace classic fertilizers and
organic nutrition and may I ask you to
[SPEAKER_06]: explain the basic principle of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a scientist at the university focused
on agricultural and soil health and
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial ecology in general, we know as
scientists and we know as agriculture
[SPEAKER_08]: specialists that it's critical to deliver
nutrients to plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that's really a challenge,
nutrient use efficiency in agriculture
[SPEAKER_08]: systems as it is in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we started focusing on natural
microbial technologies that can maximize
[SPEAKER_08]: the plant's ability to take up nutrients,
maximizing nutrient use efficiency for
[SPEAKER_08]: many nutrients so plants can naturally
maximize their health, development,
[SPEAKER_08]: quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the goal of our team, we started at the
university and now we've bridged and we
[SPEAKER_08]: focus 100% on the cannabis industry is
bringing natural microbial solutions to
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivators so we can naturally enhance
plant quality and plant yield,
[SPEAKER_08]: again, using natural processes which we
think is important not only for cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: but for all agriculture segments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll come back later and to more
details.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I want to introduce Michael.
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael is vice president of Conviron and
he's the world leading designer and
[SPEAKER_06]: supplier of controlled environments for
plant growth rooms in the plant research
[SPEAKER_06]: and AG biotech sectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have installed thousands of
facilities around the world over the last
[SPEAKER_06]: decades or your company has installed a
lot of facility within the last years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are leading the expansion into the
cannabis sector of your company.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my first question to you is how do the
regulation for Germany regarding
[SPEAKER_06]: standardization influence the design of
cannabis grow rooms in general?
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, thanks everyone for hanging
around for this last session.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking forward to just a few more minutes
with you today.
[SPEAKER_09]: One first lesson I learned is have a
longer introduction and use bigger words
[SPEAKER_09]: in my intro so that I can match some of
these guys here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What I wanted to just open up here with
was the interesting aspect of the
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations in Germany and their focus on
standardization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that comes back to our company very
well because the way we approach the world
[SPEAKER_09]: of growing and growing cannabis is to
provide solutions that create environments
[SPEAKER_09]: that really lead to standardizing outcomes
of plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we see is that the level of
control is what really drives the outcomes
[SPEAKER_09]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want standardized results,
standardized phenotypes, the standardized
[SPEAKER_09]: chemical outcomes or physical properties
of the plants, you really need to zero in
[SPEAKER_09]: on control.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that control comes from two
different aspects.
[SPEAKER_09]: One is really the brains behind the
operation, which means the control system
[SPEAKER_09]: itself and also the body of the grow
system, which is all the electrical and
[SPEAKER_09]: mechanical components, the HVAC and
irrigation and fertigation systems as
[SPEAKER_09]: well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was trying to explain that to
someone in a situation like this a while
[SPEAKER_09]: ago, and it was a professional athlete.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that athlete understood it when I
said, well, you need the brains that are
[SPEAKER_09]: sharp and adaptive and flexible and
robust, but you also need the body with
[SPEAKER_09]: the muscles and the bones that can be
responsive to those controls.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when you put together both the
brain and the body, you have a system then
[SPEAKER_09]: that will allow you to control the growth
so that you can end up with standardized
[SPEAKER_09]: results, which is really what the German
regulations are focused on right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Cem, let me introduce you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because you're also very involved in
environment control as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Cem is a serial interpreter with
two successful businesses that were handed
[SPEAKER_06]: over to management to solely focus on
changing the way the planet feeds and
[SPEAKER_06]: grows itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a nice bio.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Cem is focusing on patented
dehumification, IoT solutions,
[SPEAKER_06]: and other environmental technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: His goal is making his company,
Anamera, a world-leading smart street
[SPEAKER_06]: solution provider for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we talked in advance before the
panel, your whole family is also involved
[SPEAKER_06]: in the greenhouse business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So your whole family is very experienced
in the greenhouse business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an agriculture background and
we're more focusing on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the cannabis you also experience in
other sectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my first question to you is what do you
think the biggest impact of tightening
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations is in the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what do you think is the biggest impact
of tightening regulations in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry?
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, thanks for having us here on
this panel today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the tightening in regulations
pushed growers and consultants in Europe
[SPEAKER_07]: and in the States to be more careful about
energy consumption and how they designed
[SPEAKER_07]: the greenhouse, especially water
consumption and electricity consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is now beginning to have a more of a
serious law which needs to be taken care
[SPEAKER_07]: of on a very high level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as actually Michael said, to
standardize the way you grow is really
[SPEAKER_07]: important that you use innovative ways and
best techniques to be able to achieve
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we're talking about standardizing
growing, my next question comes to Pete.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Denver, after the regulation,
odor was a regular source for trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: Producers had with authorities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of reports in the
newspapers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do not only talk about the
controlled environment, but we also talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about controlled odor neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that also how can you achieve that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is that as complicated to achieve as a
controlled environment to have the
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled neighborhood, the odor problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so folks that are working in urban
areas and are specifically have grows in
[SPEAKER_02]: urban areas, real challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that technology is just started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we came up with, and I'll make
this a pretty quick answer, was we came up
[SPEAKER_02]: with carbon filters and we basically
designed and implemented these carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: filters on our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have gone to manufactured carbon
filters, but it was just cost prohibitive
[SPEAKER_02]: for us to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came up with designs of our own
accord and implemented those designs and
[SPEAKER_02]: created a several carbon filter system to
go ahead and mitigate as much odor as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get zero odor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's achievable with
carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is folks in the near future
that are going to come up with solutions
[SPEAKER_02]: for odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with carbon, I don't know if that's
achievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other part of that question,
I think, is that it's about community
[SPEAKER_02]: outreach, too, at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the folks in your community see you as
somebody that's bad, somebody that's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: terrible things to the community,
then there's almost a placebo effect of
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people will say, I smell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not smell cannabis, but they'll
say that they're smelling cannabis because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very easy to go to a local official
and say, I smell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like I see a communist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has that effect on people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go out in the community and you
present yourself in a positive manner,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you embrace a community, if you have
your local community as part of your labor
[SPEAKER_02]: solution, not a challenge, but your labor
solution, then all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're spending money in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're spending money that they're making
in your greenhouse or your growth
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes a long way, and that has very
long legs as far as the people seeing you
[SPEAKER_02]: in a positive light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people see you in a positive
light, they're always willing to give you
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more leeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that it's a two-fold answer
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: May I ask you an additional question about
this topic?
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw in Germany, there were some reports
about a guy running around.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like a big bag in front of his
face, and he was called the Nasal Sheriff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that existing in Denver?
[SPEAKER_06]: From the authorities, somebody with a
machine in front of his face, and he
[SPEAKER_06]: measures the odor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this really existing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have that in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got that actually up by Aspen also.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a greenhouse that was having
challenges with odor in Aspen,
[SPEAKER_02]: or right outside of Aspen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a machine that will actually,
on some objective level, and I use that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of tongue-in-cheek, measure the smell
or the organics in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how subjective is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which way is the wind blowing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is the wind blowing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it rain the night before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not rained in five or six days?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all kinds of elements to that
smell meter, if you will, being accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I would suggest doing the best
you can with mitigating the smell itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also going out in the community
and being the best neighbor you possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: can be.
[SPEAKER_07]: May I add something, Pete, to this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because odor is a big problem in the
facilities, especially in public places
[SPEAKER_07]: and Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been designing a lot of facilities
in the middle of the city, in Zurich,
[SPEAKER_07]: for example, in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually a really big problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we dived into it a little bit,
and now we have great research happening
[SPEAKER_07]: all around the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there is research on how to trap
odor.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also use HEPA and carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do work, but to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a bunch of other natural ways
of trapping odor as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Odor is a molecule, and we deal with water
molecules in air.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can also manipulate this as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe with companies like yours and
others, we're going to get to more
[SPEAKER_07]: sufficient technologies regarding odor
trapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would tell people that are looking
to get into the industry that ancillatory
[SPEAKER_02]: type of companies, there's an old saying
in the gold mining business that it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: the guys that were mining gold that made
the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the guys selling the picks and
shovels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would suggest that that is a great
place for folks to get involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: is odor mitigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there is probably going to be some
water solutions, as you alluded to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably going to be some type of
ionization solutions out there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, this is an evolving industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are on the cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks that are getting into it now are
on the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all kinds of opportunity out
there, especially in places like odor
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now my next question goes to Colin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colin, you're actually, you're dedicated
your research to soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I read some, within the last years,
I read a lot of publications.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some publications, you can read
that Dracul or other hydroponic media are
[SPEAKER_06]: more suitable for a controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you agree on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if I agree or disagree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that I visit grows all over the U
.S., all through South America,
[SPEAKER_08]: all through Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've visited hundreds, even thousands
of commercial grows and engaged in the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry 100%.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go around and do discovery and learn and
try to figure out where there's value to
[SPEAKER_08]: be made in bringing value to growers,
commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of commercial growers that
are using Rockwell in Denver, in,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, Washington state, all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's many, many that aren't.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, there's no one
silver bullet solution in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no one silver bullet solution in
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's trade-offs with every decision
we make.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in some cases, one can feel that
there is a more controlled aspect to
[SPEAKER_08]: having a very inert substrate or media
like Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think that there are some
trade-offs with respect to interacting
[SPEAKER_08]: with the plant, to engaging the plant's
full phenol phenotypic potential,
[SPEAKER_08]: and delivering to that plant what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many growers, and this is a huge movement,
especially through the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_08]: especially through South America,
and more and more even in Europe,
[SPEAKER_08]: people understand, growers understand that
we need to start reproducing soil function
[SPEAKER_08]: and interactions with microbes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these effects really maximize the
plant phenotypic potential, meaning not
[SPEAKER_08]: only do we need in today's cannabis
industry, and I'll speak of it generally,
[SPEAKER_08]: in a global level, to maximize yield,
to bring value to growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: But quality comes up everywhere we go now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yield, although it's very important,
quality has to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to distinguish yourself
as a cultivator, and I've heard it from
[SPEAKER_08]: growers and consumers here in Germany,
through a quality aspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so not only is, you know, these inputs
important, but environment's important and
[SPEAKER_08]: energy's important, all these things that
we are talking about on this panel are
[SPEAKER_08]: interacting to maximize not only plant
yield, to bring value to farmers,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also plant quality, which is critical
for distinguishing yourself and maximizing
[SPEAKER_08]: the value of your product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael, Colin just told us there are
several ways to grow cannabis on several
[SPEAKER_06]: mediums, and you built up dozens of
facilities worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only the medium that differs.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do the facilities differ from each
other you build up?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what we've seen as we travel
around the world and see different
[SPEAKER_09]: facilities is the vast diversity of how
people approach designing their
[SPEAKER_09]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're looking at using different
technologies and different design
[SPEAKER_09]: configurations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we set aside the greenhouse side,
which is not my area of expertise,
[SPEAKER_09]: but from an indoor growing facility
perspective, what we see is vast diversity
[SPEAKER_09]: in the lighting that is chosen,
whether that's LED or HPS or other forms
[SPEAKER_09]: of lighting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see people wanting to have very
distinct indoor environments for the
[SPEAKER_09]: different stages of growth of the plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So from clone to veg to flowering to even
drying.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also want to look at different
solutions for how they grow, whether
[SPEAKER_09]: that's hydroponics, aeroponics in multiple
tiers, or just in a single tier of plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we see this wide range of
diversity, and all these elements have to
[SPEAKER_09]: be anticipated in the design of an indoor
growing room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what we do is we see how these
elements come together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we really see is we can create a
highly uniform environment so that all the
[SPEAKER_09]: plants within that environment are growing
at the same rate and they're maturing at
[SPEAKER_09]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Throughout the room, so whether it's the
back corner or the front of the room,
[SPEAKER_09]: everything is maturing at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get that uniformity, not only of
yield and outcome, but also in the
[SPEAKER_09]: specific properties of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the ways that we see that
varying from room to room is how different
[SPEAKER_09]: people handle air flow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we look at how to direct air in
different directions to accommodate the
[SPEAKER_09]: different growing systems that the grower
is going to choose.
[SPEAKER_09]: In general, we strive for a very uniform
and laminar flow of air, but often the way
[SPEAKER_09]: the growing system is configured,
we have to work around that as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the diversity of the growing techniques
has a big impact on how the rooms are
[SPEAKER_09]: ultimately designed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me just come to the next question
about growing rooms or how to fulfill the
[SPEAKER_06]: standardization best way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cem, what do you think, what do you
foresee the upcoming trends in the near
[SPEAKER_06]: future regarding automation and
standardization in the grow room?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much innovation happening in
the world and in the sector.
[SPEAKER_07]: My expertise is more air flow,
water usage, and air circulation actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Michael mentioned, and how we can
extract the water that the plants are
[SPEAKER_07]: transpiring and how we can reuse the
energies inside, as in latent energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also as automation, it's now I'm
seeing that there are lots of automation
[SPEAKER_07]: in benches, there's automation in
everything now, but IoT is a very
[SPEAKER_07]: important part of the design I think
everything should collect data and you
[SPEAKER_07]: should be able to see how well your
automation is working and the outcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because doing the automation is something,
but also seeing the outcome positively,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's so important what you use for what
automation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess it's something to do with the
idea of the grower, what exactly they want
[SPEAKER_07]: to achieve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can use the automations
regarding to the topics.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we first met today, you told me a
very interesting detail I've never heard
[SPEAKER_06]: so much about yet because I know that the
humidity in the grow rooms is a big
[SPEAKER_06]: problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you found a way to suck out the
humidity out of the air?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we patented a way to basically
discharge latent energy usually the
[SPEAKER_07]: systems around the world, they convert
latent energy, which is the secret energy
[SPEAKER_07]: inside the grow chambers into sensible
heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's always an unwanted heat inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we do is we don't challenge this,
we just discharge it outside with another
[SPEAKER_07]: medium we use, which is a liquid
desiccant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is how we actually reduced
operation costs, this is how we control
[SPEAKER_07]: total humidity and temperature,
and this is how we also recycle the water
[SPEAKER_07]: that we capture inside the grow house and
reuse it in irrigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a nearly closed system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my next question goes to Pete.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pete, you're also a shop owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how important is standardization of the
products for your business and your
[SPEAKER_06]: customers from a shop owner's perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: A great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we've kind of talked about
that in some of these environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Environmental control questions also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are looking to standardize all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking to strive to that place
where every time we harvest a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics that we get the same results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we do that every time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course not, because everything
changes almost on a minute-to-minute
[SPEAKER_02]: basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air changes, humidity changes,
sunlight changes, artificial lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: changes, CO2 content changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to the best of our ability,
as much as we can, with our environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: controls, with our knowledge about growing
cannabis, that is what we try to achieve,
[SPEAKER_02]: where all of our plants are growing as
standard or as close to being standard as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that context, my next question goes
to Michael.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pete just told us about humidity in the
grow room and other critical climate
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what are the critical design elements
that must be considered in any growing
[SPEAKER_06]: environment?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you designed the room,
so how do you achieve that?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you have to put in any room?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I leapt to the answer to that
question in the last time I spoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I won't repeat too much, other than,
of course, lighting, temperature and
[SPEAKER_09]: humidity are the big factors that need to
be controlled, especially in any
[SPEAKER_09]: environment, of course, but particularly
in an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I wanted to leverage that into is
just following on from Pete talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: hitting standards by controlling the
environment, whether it's greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_09]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we see,
especially in the experience in Canada,
[SPEAKER_09]: and also in the States, but there is a lot
of testing, a lot of hurdles that every
[SPEAKER_09]: product has to go through.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's not as though there's no
standardization requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as the industry becomes more and more
competitive, I think that growers are
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be looking for more ways to
standardize the way they differentiate
[SPEAKER_09]: their products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just passing the tests of safety and
health and making sure all the microbial
[SPEAKER_09]: accounts are where they should be,
but also if you find a way to
[SPEAKER_09]: differentiate your product from the
perspective of taste, smell, or
[SPEAKER_09]: experience, then you want to be able to
dial that recipe into your operation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so having that ability, whether it's
doing a greenhouse grow or more
[SPEAKER_09]: particularly an indoor grow, you want to
have that ability to control the light,
[SPEAKER_09]: the spectrum, the intensity, to manage the
humidity properly, and also to be able to
[SPEAKER_09]: control all those other things like
additive CO2 and all your nutrients as
[SPEAKER_09]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Colin, you also know a lot about
setting up the whole environment for the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a lot of regulations where
you have your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in how far do the different regulations
in different states and different
[SPEAKER_06]: countries facilitate or hinder your
business?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty fun topic, and that makes
my job pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: As I go everywhere I go, it's a new puzzle
to solve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: has different regulatory pressures,
so to speak, if it's chemical or
[SPEAKER_08]: microbial.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really important for those
growers to be able to follow those.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think overall it's standard.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's testing labs, and growers can
follow that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the real challenge with
cultivation in general is mitigating
[SPEAKER_08]: variability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you want to do, and this is what
has been talked about more than anything
[SPEAKER_08]: else I think while we're up here,
is consistency, repeatability,
[SPEAKER_08]: and reducing variability so you can dial
in the same product time and time again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if growers can do that, I think that's
the biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talk about, you know, you can use a
simple phenotype formula.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're dealing with is precision
agriculture, and everything should be
[SPEAKER_08]: defined as precise as possible always.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a simple phenotype formula,
maximizing our plant quality and yield to
[SPEAKER_08]: the ideals that we want based on dialing
in our plant genetics over time,
[SPEAKER_08]: our environment and inputs over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's critical, but one thing that
people overlook pretty bad in many cases
[SPEAKER_08]: is workflow and turnover, because people
create variability.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of costs associated with
workflow that's underestimated,
[SPEAKER_08]: and a lot of error and variability that's
introduced into growing because of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so not only do we have to dial in all
these technical details in the
[SPEAKER_08]: infrastructure and climate and repeatable
inputs, but we have to have our SOPs in
[SPEAKER_08]: place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have to dial in how we're growing
so we're not wasting a lot of time and a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've worked in some grows that were very
efficient that had three growers,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I've worked with other grows that
didn't seem very efficient that were about
[SPEAKER_08]: the same size that had 20.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a huge cost, and then that
variability and turnover is just
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible, and it creates a lot of error
with respect to the end product over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any regulation you prosper from
except that it's legal?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all prosper from regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that there's some regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: The challenge with regulations is the
regulators aren't growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not chemists.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're people that are following the
rules and are getting informed and
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes getting informed from people
that aren't that informed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when you look at some of these
rules and regulations, they're
[SPEAKER_08]: generalities that create a lot of pressure
and extra cost for cultivators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's important at this stage
because this plan this crop is way more
[SPEAKER_08]: regulated than any other food crop in the
world.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it's consumed very differently
than any other food crop in the world,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I understand those pressures.
[SPEAKER_08]: You talked to the health department in
Colorado, for example.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very concerned about pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of pesticide use and it's
regulated heavily.
[SPEAKER_08]: The same pesticides are used on a lot of
food crops that's not regulated heavily,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we aren't combusting potatoes when we
consume them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're combusting this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not extracting and concentrating
potato extract where we are with this
[SPEAKER_08]: plant, and even non-trace amounts of some
chemicals can concentrate into potentially
[SPEAKER_08]: toxic amounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is a very different beast,
and health and regulators in general are
[SPEAKER_08]: treating it very thoughtfully right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think it's important to work with
regulators and educate them to understand
[SPEAKER_08]: where these thresholds of true risk are
versus education, opportunities to
[SPEAKER_08]: mitigate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite interesting because we don't
have all that here in Germany because we
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have production.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know, but we don't have that experience
yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my next question goes to Cheb.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheb, your family's experience in
agriculture all over the world building up
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did not talk about feeding the
plants yet, and I know that most people
[SPEAKER_06]: most cannabis patients want to have a
clean product.
[SPEAKER_06]: In how far does a clean product and
biological organic growing fit together
[SPEAKER_06]: with a controlled environment?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that possible to make an organic
product, 100% organic product in a
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled environment?
[SPEAKER_07]: The word organic is actually a very
general word, I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course it is possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been working with grow owners that
are shooting for to be more organic,
[SPEAKER_07]: to use less water, to use no pesticides,
even aquaponics is now very popular in
[SPEAKER_07]: Europe regarding even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aeroponic growing, you see, so all of the
mediums do change with the type of growing
[SPEAKER_07]: systems that people are trying to have and
achieve.
[SPEAKER_07]: But regarding standardization,
it's important what outcome comes from
[SPEAKER_07]: these facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think time is still needed to
actually see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also think that data collection is
really important regarding questions like
[SPEAKER_07]: this, because you need to prove as well
how you achieved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just how you did it, but you need
to be able to show what was your
[SPEAKER_07]: environmental conditions, how you actually
got into producing something more organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, and let's just go deeper into an
additional question.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you achieve that?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you document that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you make a documentation about your
progress?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have a software that keeps track
of anything, any electrical equipment
[SPEAKER_07]: inside your facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can go back a year, back to any
month, to any hour, to any day.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can monitor a single plant with it,
for example?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can monitor single plants with
grief.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's many automations and many systems
where you can collect data from.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's up to how many sensors you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: We usually use 35 sensors in one room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can basically go to any time of
your grow facility and see what your
[SPEAKER_07]: condition was in and prove it,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is also documentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also a very, very important part of
standardization, ain't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to interrupt, but we're almost...
It's me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right here in the front.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to... I'm hard to notice.
[SPEAKER_06]: A very, very last question to read,
because I saved this question until the
[SPEAKER_06]: end, and it's a slightly controversial
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have the most experience from
everybody here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a long time in the cannabis scene
and fought for legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my general question to you is a little
bit controversial, but how much regulation
[SPEAKER_06]: does cannabis need?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it needs a lot at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I say that is because we
want to embrace the public, and we want
[SPEAKER_02]: the public to be our partners in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the public, without the guy that's
your neighbor and the guy that's across
[SPEAKER_02]: the street from you, we don't succeed at
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, we have to have the
general public say, this is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be something that we can
consume without being hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be something that is not going
to affect our children.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we embrace standardization,
if we embrace regulation, that is our best
[SPEAKER_02]: way forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from folks that are going to be part
of this industry, it really sets us apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sets us apart on so many different
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more than anything, it makes us better
at what we do, because the more
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations we have, the better we'll be
at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was a nice final word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any time for questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have maybe two or three minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start here, and then we'll
see if we can get over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colin, I didn't hear much detail about
microbial or biodynamic or alternatives to
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you expand on that a bit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, in brief, and we can talk more about
it offline.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, microbials are the quickest
growing agriculture segment within all
[SPEAKER_08]: industries, because we understand that
microbes and interacting microbes in soil
[SPEAKER_08]: and substrates help maximize nutrient use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's critical.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also know, and you talk to a lot of
growers specifically for this industry,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's becoming very popular in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, quickly, I started my company a
couple years ago, and now we just got
[SPEAKER_08]: product of the year in the UK.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in over 800 shops in the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in over a couple hundred shops in
Europe and all through South America,
[SPEAKER_08]: because microbes have expanded.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even two years ago, I had to educate
everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my job is education and support,
like it was at the university as a PhD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing now, but I'm focused
on the cannabis industry and educating
[SPEAKER_08]: growers now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think plants in nature don't exist
without microbial interactions,
[SPEAKER_08]: none.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so interacting and bringing those
microbial processes and interactions back
[SPEAKER_08]: into precision agriculture, I think,
does a lot not only to maximize value as
[SPEAKER_08]: far as yield and quality, but to bring
these interactions that might not be
[SPEAKER_08]: present to the degree that they need to be
to maximize, again, the plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_08]: express some of these quality factors that
we really see.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you add microbes into a grow,
we see the improved terpene profiles and
[SPEAKER_08]: improved yields.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this quality metric really goes up
along with yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's a lot of value that we
think that we can bring in general across
[SPEAKER_08]: all agriculture segments by incorporating
microbes, not replacing fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's what we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think that's realistic.
[SPEAKER_08]: In some soil environments where there is a
buildup of nutrients, you can actually
[SPEAKER_08]: really reduce fertilizer inputs and
replace them with microbial solutions.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in precision agriculture, you're never
going to displace completely fertilizer
[SPEAKER_08]: applications.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to complement nutrients with
microbial functionality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is for you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you thinking about using
microorganisms for pest control as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially since we heard California has
such great problems with pesticides,
[SPEAKER_05]: like killing one fungi with another fungi
might be a good idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you searching for that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: We think that's a really interesting
solution because there are so many
[SPEAKER_08]: problems in this industry in particular
with chemical solutions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And growers in general are really limited
to the solutions they have to control
[SPEAKER_08]: pests.
[SPEAKER_08]: And pests are a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: Russet mites, spider mites, powdery
mildew, depending on where you are,
[SPEAKER_08]: fungal gnats.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of problems, especially in
monocrops and controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we don't have the right solutions,
there's a lot of value to control those.
[SPEAKER_08]: And controlling those naturally is
important.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we still have resources at Colorado
State University.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have several 5,000 square foot
greenhouses and a 62 acre farm that we
[SPEAKER_08]: grow cannabis on.
[SPEAKER_08]: All for agriculture research purposes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can look for new solutions,
not only for new nutrient or bio stimulant
[SPEAKER_08]: solutions, but also for bio control
solutions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what you're talking about,
bringing natural solutions for control
[SPEAKER_08]: aspects as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we absolutely think that's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the stigmas that often attach to
cannabis is that it can cause psychosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: craziness, madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched a documentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black fish, what happens when you take an
orca out of its wild natural environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: The more we take cannabis out of its
natural environment, generations down the
[SPEAKER_01]: line, do you feel there could be a problem
with increased psychosis, with the more
[SPEAKER_01]: cloned, chemically fed, or yeah,
it's an unnatural environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly create unnatural plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to take that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I answer that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you genetically modify any
crop that you can run into unexpected
[SPEAKER_02]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since cannabis and especially active
THC is psychotropic, is that a potential?
[SPEAKER_02]: It absolutely is a potential, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to leave it right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for the panel once again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give yourselves a round of applause for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That concludes the second annual
International Cannabis Business Conference
[SPEAKER_04]: right here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still get tickets for Vancouver,
which will be in June.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are going to be in Portland,
Oregon in September.
[SPEAKER_04]: So come to that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really, really appreciate it on behalf
of Alex Rogers and everyone else at the
[SPEAKER_04]: International Cannabis Business
Conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Auf Wiedersehen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Auf Wiedersehen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.
Auf Wiedersehen.
