All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as Engayo said, we are here to discuss
the future of cannabis and the impact that
[SPEAKER_05]: the stigmas have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have here Stephen Martin Mayer from
Fido Flow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's an expert on the Colombian
markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Viola Brunetelli, who is from
Cannabis Chitza.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably pronounced that
incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's an expert on the Italian and Swiss
markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Rebecca Allen Tapp, who is from
AGI, who is an expert on American and UK
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have Stefan Oroll,
the CEO of Hemp Group and the president of
[SPEAKER_05]: Gushi Culture Ibiza, and a specialist on
the German and Spanish markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to open our question with,
we're going to open this panel discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: with from the countries that you're in.
[SPEAKER_05]: What types of social stigmas have you
experienced?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually grew up in Europe,
so I'm not Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had more than 15 years working in Spain,
but the last four years I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colombia for a company called Plena
Global.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia is very interesting when it comes
to stigma, because obviously the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that comes to our minds when we
think of Colombia is probably Netflix,
[SPEAKER_00]: the narco series, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you fly there the first time,
that's the feeling you get is I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go there and maybe Pablo is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is in the last 10 years there's
been great changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has also been a strategy of the
government is that since drugs are there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are being consumed, and you can
accuse Colombia of producing cocaine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somebody is buying it and somebody is
consuming it apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not try to make a legal market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of that and kind of refresh the image
of Colombia by also bringing economic
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities which are legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been a very interesting
experience for me to go and be part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this experiment, so to say, though you
still really feel when you say that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with cannabis in Colombia,
the first reaction is so why are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you talking to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Call the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you explain there is a medical
legal market and things change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rebecca, what about the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: has continued to evolve.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was growing up it was very much
the, I lived in California, so it was very
[SPEAKER_04]: much like the Snoop Dogg kind of,
you know, Cheech and Chong, that's really
[SPEAKER_04]: what you saw a lot of.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as it started to legalize we saw,
it just completely changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go into a dispensary and you'd see,
you know, your neighbor's grandma,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you'd see your coworkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd see every person there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that legalization has really
helped to change the stigma and shift it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the interesting thing is, is now
because it's so political, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: that shift again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently in the U.S., I'm sure you all
know, there's epidemic of gun violence and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's been plenty of school shootings
and now those are actually being tied into
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a whole, we're seeing a whole new
manifestation of a war on drugs happening
[SPEAKER_04]: and stigma is the driving force behind
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like everywhere else, I think it's just
continuously evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say in Germany, since the
talk of legalization, it's getting better,
[SPEAKER_02]: but still when you talk to people and say
that you're a cannabis consumer,
[SPEAKER_02]: the most people think you're a lazy
pothead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's truly not the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I compare it to Spain,
cannabis is more part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we have the cannabis social clubs
and like smoking cannabis for recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: uses, they're not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what Myra is doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here after lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to digest with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come from Italy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working currently both in Italy and in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Italy, we had legal medical cannabis
for now 10 years, almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although we were just discussing this,
one thing is changing regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes time, but it doesn't take as much
time as changing a culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things, for example,
that we still notice is the choice of
[SPEAKER_03]: words that still are trying to,
in some ways, feel less aggressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many, even many doctors who I train,
healthcare professionals is what we do
[SPEAKER_03]: with our company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often we have, you know, our students
and our medical doctors that instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: using the word cannabis, they still say
canapametica, which is a medical hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: because in some ways it feels less
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels less of a drug because what they
heard for so many years is that cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: was just associated with a narcotic and
with something completely illicit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the moment that they find themselves
actually having the possibility to
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribe it legally in their office,
in their medical practice, they need to
[SPEAKER_03]: find ways to feel better about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so changing a culture, it will take
way longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say it's a sort of like George
Orwell, 1984 idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't have the word,
you don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for example, I would assume that in
the States, there is still very strong
[SPEAKER_03]: this idea of the marijuana word still used
for a very strong stigma around it and the
[SPEAKER_03]: type of consumers actually, or the type of
people around the marijuana world,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually being like taken out of
like some of the regulation work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Washington State actually just
made it so that marijuana is no longer a
[SPEAKER_04]: terminology used in any of their
compliance or regulatory policies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a question then, and this is,
it's actually just listening to you guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's governments and large corporations
that are creating stigmas as well now or
[SPEAKER_05]: feeding into this, which is causing
confusion because as you're pointing out,
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp versus cannabis is not the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, I work in, I have a CBD
company and when you speak with people
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of the industry and you're telling
them, yeah, I work in legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and CBD, the most people start
smiling and saying, yeah, it makes you
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than making you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a stigma in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's an interesting thing as
well, because cannabis does make you high.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people, when they want to talk about
being a patient, it's about easing pain
[SPEAKER_05]: and nobody wants to acknowledge the high
part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then again, that's a stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with being high?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would like to add that often,
I mean, from a medical perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see euphoria described as a side
effect, excuse me, but I think euphoria is
[SPEAKER_03]: a pretty decent effect to be given to a
patient, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a patient, I hate that stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that I have to feel uncomfortable
about my cannabis use, especially like if
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm using it and I'm just trying to use it
to relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not using it for whatever I'm using it
because sometimes I'm out and I don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to drink, so I bring my own stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel I have to kind of hide it
because I'm like, almost then like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, well, I'm not helping the patient
cause if I'm using cannabis outside of
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everything has to be in a neat
box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis, hemp, patient, recreational,
medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to have these clear, defined
boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is something that's
not going to easily fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we're finding that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and it's interesting and you can ask
yourself this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use cannabis, how do you say you
use it?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you categorize yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you call yourself a patient?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause if you are, do you have a
prescription?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do, where did you get it from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess it also opens up a big
conversation here or a big issue to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand also when wellness ends and
medical starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I go to the spine and get a
massage, maybe that's the reason why I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going into surgery because I have a
real issue with my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a certain preventive action
that wellness does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that direction, I think it's
important to understand that it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: defined concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around this, there is a lot to do with
what do you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not be sick, but you are
absorbing a lot of stress in the
[SPEAKER_00]: workplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's having a little smoke at
night, something that is just recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use, or is it maybe something that
prevents you then to get into serious
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety and all this kind of more
complicated- Sleep better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep better, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sleep quality, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, I think there is a lot of
confusion, but this confusion,
[SPEAKER_00]: we tend to try to put it into the same
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I was having a conversation with
a doctor and said, yeah, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with morphine, we have morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a scale and you can, yeah,
okay, but this is not morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand those that do morphine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be very careful or it might be
the last thing you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, you can self-treat and
you probably most certainly won't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like riding a bicycle, you have to
find your own equilibrium, but then you
[SPEAKER_00]: will understand what is the limit,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is making people accountable for
their own behavior.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every society struggles with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we've all talked about this,
the importance of setting intention with
[SPEAKER_04]: your use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of how you're using it,
you need to have intention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Intention and setting is not just for
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we should really
incorporate that into cannabis use as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really getting into the mind form of
why am I using this?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is my goal?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is my intention?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do I want to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that if we just took that time
and put space between action and reaction
[SPEAKER_04]: and really like thought about what we were
doing, not just with eating, so just
[SPEAKER_04]: putting food in your face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with using any kind of
recreational or medical drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we using it and how long was the
intention behind it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So then that's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I'm going to say that's
accountability that people don't want.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about, let's talk about the illicit
market and the stigmas behind that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came from the US obviously, so it's no,
our war on drugs has influenced the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which we are, I'm the first to be here and
say sorry everyone for all of this on
[SPEAKER_04]: behalf of my country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's challenging because then we've
kind of taken this other stigma direction
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think is interesting where you
hear so much about the illicit market and
[SPEAKER_04]: the black market, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like demonized thugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is, yeah, but my experience is like,
one of my, I have, I definitely source
[SPEAKER_04]: illicitly, plenty of times with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would get things like special
strains for what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would do more testing than some of
the producers that I actually can purchase
[SPEAKER_04]: on the prescription route.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can actually get a COA from my illicit
source, easier than I can get one from a
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription pharmacy in the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also will tell me kind of what to
expect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the terpene profiles and give me
more information on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what it will feel like.
[SPEAKER_04]: My doctors can't tell me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not a lot of incentive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's another way to push
people into more of the standardized
[SPEAKER_04]: format is by demonizing the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's also that caregiver model
in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the 90s when medical became legal,
there was the caregiver format where
[SPEAKER_04]: people would grow in a community for
patients in their community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's something we really
need to explore, but they're really making
[SPEAKER_04]: it challenging for individual growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you feel that when it comes to
quality, illicit versus the large
[SPEAKER_05]: corporations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's, I mean, in Europa,
we were opening up our flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell a difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the nose knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a completely different quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's also building a relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a human relationship factor there
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know my producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I go through the prescription route,
it's picked for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I go through my local grower,
I know what he likes, his interests,
[SPEAKER_04]: what matters to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know how he cares about growing the
plant and the people he's caring for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's just that relationship there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something we're missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about, let's talk about, what do you
see in the near future?
[SPEAKER_05]: What changes do you see coming when it
comes to stigmas and the impacts it's
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna have?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I really feel should be
addressed is, especially even the
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream media speaks about it all the
time, is that there is this feeling that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will be consumed once it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are hundreds of millions of
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday night, I don't know if somebody
was here at the smoking area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: concert, but it smelled familiar to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is already being consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what will happen once
it's legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the feeling is also that once it's
legal, all the problems are solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've seen that with gay rights,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have gay rights in Europe,
but you can still go to rural areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: walk hand in hand, same sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably they'll throw stones at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't change with the legality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legality is not the beginning and it's
not the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legality is a change in compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a change in how the legal system and
the society processes, whatever your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal consumption is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fight goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's very important that as an
industry, we also get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we are all working for
competing companies, but we get together
[SPEAKER_00]: and realize that tobacco and alcohol have
strong lobbies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work together to get the best rules
so then they can play the game of I sell
[SPEAKER_00]: more than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before there is a lobby, and I have
the feeling that the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: still has to mature a lot in that aspect
so that the fight will go on and the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes will occur also after big changes
like in Germany occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an ongoing process and especially
to remove the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was giving you the example the other day
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was at a graduation, someone getting
finished university, if I bring a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: of champagne, I'm seen as a very nice
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I bring a bomb, probably I'm going to
be looked at as this weirdo called
[SPEAKER_00]: security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really shows you the stigma
because at that moment we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to party or celebrate in whatever
form or shape we feel is the right one,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you come to conferences,
you get drinks for free, but why don't you
[SPEAKER_02]: get joints for free?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you're pushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a cannabis conference,
don't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this idea for the next ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then another stigma, tying into the
legal side of it, if the fear is behind
[SPEAKER_05]: getting charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say for a lot of cannabis patients
in Germany right now, the only reason
[SPEAKER_02]: there are patients is that we don't get
fined from the police because as a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis patient like me, I have some
pain, but my most reason to be a patient
[SPEAKER_02]: is to not get in trouble with the cops
when I have my weed with me when I travel
[SPEAKER_02]: and when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you called yourself a patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole thing is that when Germany,
when everything is organized and legal,
[SPEAKER_05]: rec side, medical side, will you still
call yourself a patient?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hopefully not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a recreational user and I know the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, cannabis is like the super food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it in my daily nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use not just THC, I use CBD,
CBG, all of the very priority of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just to make you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, if we are able to talk
more openly about cannabis, that can give
[SPEAKER_02]: us much more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm going to have a slightly
different opinion on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in my country, in Italy,
I would say probably around max 5% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: patients are there because they have a
prescription because they are recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you want to call it recreational
consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like Stefan's wellness concept
because I think it really makes a good
[SPEAKER_03]: point for several reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the prescription process isn't
really smooth like most countries still.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black market is still cheaper than
going to a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, the majority, I would say the
80%, 75% of the patients that we have for
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical market in Italy are naive to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never tried cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm fearing for the future in Europe,
moving towards a direction of recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: market, which of course we are all looking
forward to, is that this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen before a true maturing of the
medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I mean with arriving to a true
mature point?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I mean is at least getting free
healthcare meaning a totally remorse
[SPEAKER_03]: medication for the medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that way, I can ensure that patients
actually are still getting a product that
[SPEAKER_03]: is at the highest quality possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, as much as we can go
to a store and buy wine or go in a bar and
[SPEAKER_03]: get our glass, of course, I'm looking
forward to a recreational market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we implemented now in which our
medical markets are still not,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the majority of prescription both
here in Germany, in Italy, in the active
[SPEAKER_03]: medical markets, let's say, they're still
private.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is gonna create a huge issue
because of course, the moment that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a smoother path through Iraq market
than the medical market, anyone is gonna,
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone, I mean, any person that needs
cannabis even for medical reasons is gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: go through that market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's gonna be the guarantee for that
patient?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't, I mean, I'm looking forward
for everything to move fast, but mainly
[SPEAKER_03]: for insurances and public healthcare to
really take this on board because
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise, we are not creating a really
good scenario for patients, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm gonna touch on the pros and
cons of growing your own.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a patient, if you're able to grow
your own flower and consume it at your own
[SPEAKER_05]: risk, if you know what you're doing,
but where do you see that going?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the pros and cons with growing
your own flower then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe here I have a little bit of a
controversial usually opinion because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was once in Uruguay and I had quite a few
mothers running after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, it was an association called
Mama Cultiva and it was mothers growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for their own kids, which were affected by
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave the negative opinion on that
kind of situation because I feel this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very serious condition and you need to
know exactly what dosage, what exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: kids are getting, and especially you need
to go through quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intentions are not the only good thing
that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing to have good intentions,
but contaminations, they come also with
[SPEAKER_00]: good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of absorbs contamination from
the soil, from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a lot of bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A total quality control of a batch would
cost you, I would say, between $2,000 and
[SPEAKER_00]: $3,000 if you want to go and see
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heavy metal, all the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there, depending on the condition,
I am not so much in favor of people
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, I met adults in Canada,
which were on a wheelchair because they
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually in a traffic accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the driver in this example I'm
thinking right now was a drunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he was also the victim of a drunk
driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was growing his own cannabis,
but now it was for a condition of chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I justify the consumption
much more than in a kid with epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: because, first of all, there was also the
beautiful experience of growing your own
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, which he was really proud of his
own plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adults use chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find also what's the right genetic for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is much more easy to accept personal
consumption or personal growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think there is a problem with
pesticides and stuff, because right now
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody is allowed to grow their own
tomatoes or fruits and stuff, and people
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to have it like a hobby and want
to do something special, totally organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is the direction where
home grow goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at alcohol, it's not
forbidden to make your own, but who does
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really few have something special for
a special night for friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it will be the same with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there will be some guys who are
growing their own cannabis right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they will do it in the future for
their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't have to fear about the
police anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even in the US, some of the stuff
that's even grown that's sold through
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries, you go in and you think,
oh, it's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been tested for everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's actually not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even going through and buying something
that has to go through a rigmarole of
[SPEAKER_04]: rules and metric system and all that BS,
there's still not good testing standards
[SPEAKER_04]: for things like microbials and heavy
metals and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each state has different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like looking at that
model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then exploring the home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know where there's a good
satisfied model already in existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even what you're buying and you
think is safe isn't safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there just aren't proper standards for
testing out yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, let's say everybody
is able to grow the best flower ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also very disruptive for the large
corporations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what type of impact do you think they
would want to impose on a stigma knock
[SPEAKER_05]: around the way you're going to grow your
flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to just continue the conversation
on homegrown and the direction it probably
[SPEAKER_03]: will go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to agree with what Stefan is
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily see it as a solution
for medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there is a lot of
untapped potential in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are all thinking about decarboxylated
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I think about homegrown,
I actually think about wellness and
[SPEAKER_03]: getting my own fresh raw juice of
cannabinoid acids and flavonoids and a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of good stuff that I wouldn't be able to
get anywhere in a shop, whether that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational market or a medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really from using the roots of the
plant to the sprouts, there is so many
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds and interesting treater of
flavonoids and a lot of stuff beyond
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids that is incredibly
interesting on a wellness perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, to be a bit of a crazy
neuroscientist, I think it's also
[SPEAKER_03]: important really to think about the
manufacturing process, the growing
[SPEAKER_03]: process, and the type of energy that you
put in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, that's very up in the air,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for a lot of ancient culture,
it wasn't because if you think about how,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, Ayurvedic medicine are
produced, people pray before starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: take the roots and then manufacturing them
and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, then you make a little batch of,
let's say, your own, instead of your own
[SPEAKER_03]: grappa or whatever, you have your own
homemade special things that you can make
[SPEAKER_03]: your friends try either for fun or for
wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that a solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: For the mothers in Uruguay?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, also because I don't expect
everyone to have the time and the tools
[SPEAKER_03]: and the capacity or even the clean soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can be as strict as you want
on your own way of cultivating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm thinking, for example,
I come from north of Italy where there is
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of growing and completely
non-organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can be as organic as you want,
but then you will have to put so many
[SPEAKER_03]: batches to protect your land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the patch that you have
available is super tiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it can't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to basically reflect to real
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And real life is not like we all have this
massive land of organic and nirvana and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is gonna be great because you
have great intentions behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good points.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm gonna bring up the obvious
stigma, the stoner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about stoners.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you hear the word stoner,
what do you think of?
[SPEAKER_05]: What comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna share what comes to my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually a man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really an image that comes to
mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you guys think of when you hear
the word stoner?
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are we so afraid to be called a
stoner?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Stefan just said it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that image of the unaccomplished,
too lazy, da-bi-da-bi-da.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's measured with productivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, I think still in the
type of world we live in, success of a
[SPEAKER_03]: person is based a lot on the ultimate goal
of their productivity, which also I find
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty strange, but that's for another
topic probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on, what comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you guys made some great points,
but it is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think about like productivity at
the stereotype of the lazy stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that I think is interesting,
too, is that I feel like there's this
[SPEAKER_04]: culture, too, with working cannabis,
is that we can work and go to these
[SPEAKER_04]: conferences, but I don't know that
everyone is like, it's acceptable,
[SPEAKER_04]: like socially admit that you're using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, either or even if you're like
medicinally using it, using it before
[SPEAKER_04]: work, I think that there's still a lot
with that and it's seen as like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we were talking about a colleague
that can use cannabis at any time of day
[SPEAKER_04]: and it actually calms their mind and they
do better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas I think that the intention and
when people look at you, you think,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, well, if they use it, they're not
going to get anything done.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to sit around and smoke
and eat food and clock out and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's perpetuating that because a
lot of us are here fighting for it and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think that it should be more acceptable in
the workplace as well within bounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: within boundaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's interesting because,
yeah, you go for a few beers for lunch,
[SPEAKER_05]: you come back to work and that's okay,
but yeah, what are people going to think
[SPEAKER_05]: of you if you go out, have a joint,
come back and you're high?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's about amount,
too, like amount of use.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like for instance, like you
talked about people making their own
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big fan of people making their own
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do my own coconut oils and I put that
coconut oil in my coffee and I do only
[SPEAKER_04]: like a quarter of a teaspoon and I take it
every single day and I do it before I go
[SPEAKER_04]: to work, but no one can know it's in my
coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, now obviously because it's out
there, you guys know my secrets,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it makes me better at my job because
there's so much going on and there's so
[SPEAKER_04]: much to do in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet everyone in this audience is doing
15 things right now while watching this
[SPEAKER_04]: panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably posting, talking about it,
like figuring out, you know, content and
[SPEAKER_04]: scheduling meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got so much work to do that it helps
me close some of those tabs in my brain
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't want to feel like me using
that to help me get work done makes me any
[SPEAKER_04]: less productive in the eyes of my
employers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just like stoner is a
stereotype that we have to try to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of, but stereotypes in general are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all have a different face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have a different DNA and we all
have a different endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people react to cannabis in a way
which makes them more productive and
[SPEAKER_00]: others become couch potatoes or whatever
you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody has to find their own
inner balance, you know, that famous
[SPEAKER_00]: stasis, which is the basics, the basics
also of what the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end your productivity is
something you have to see whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: productive or not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So too much coffee also makes you too
nervous and you're not productive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nobody's going to tell you they don't
have enough coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately those are really personal
things, I think, if you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take away the stereotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for me as stoner someone who misuse
cannabis, who use it way too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some people it's the best to use
cannabis in the morning to start the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me not, and then I get too lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know it for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know exactly when it's good for me to
use cannabis and when not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't use it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some days I start earlier,
some days I start later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every day is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're an accountable stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like I would say, sure, the misuse
of cannabis if used too much, it happens
[SPEAKER_02]: for a party like last night or the night
before, but not on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me a stoner is somebody who uses it on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like almost abusing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's his intentions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important we, also I mean we
are the industry, so it's really important
[SPEAKER_03]: we check our own bias at the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember once I was visiting Stefan
Mayer at the place he was working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just passing by behind one of his
several calls and he was on a call with
[SPEAKER_03]: some colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them were from Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me it was very peculiar the fact
that without taking off the screen camera,
[SPEAKER_03]: so like, oh sorry now my camera isn't
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, they were in front of the camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couple of them took it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, I mean I've been working in
this industry now 11 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I should be totally okay with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, this is like the corporate
world for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then I realized that also I might
be part of the problem if I find that
[SPEAKER_03]: shocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I might not have found that
shocking if they had like the little sip
[SPEAKER_03]: of panache or radler as you call it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's important to also,
I mean this is the reason of this panel,
[SPEAKER_03]: like where is our bias?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you Farida were mentioning as
well on an employing point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I want to employ someone that clearly
looks like someone that is a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the point is that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we all mentioned, there are some people
that if they aren't consumers,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not gonna be as good workers as
they could.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's to keep this point always
in check.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the thing, it starts with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: As an individual for yourself and how you
perceive things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an awareness, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about women and stigmas with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to start, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're the women, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The men can explain if they would like.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, I work in the medical side and
healthcare side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the toughest part is always when
it comes to the point of the mother or the
[SPEAKER_03]: woman that wants to become a mother or the
doctor that has to, what do I do with,
[SPEAKER_03]: shall I take off this medication?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say, for example, a lot of
conditions, a lot of conditions that we
[SPEAKER_03]: consider deficiency, the result of a
deficiency of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly they are, the incidence is way
higher on women.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it comes to this point of a life
of a woman that she might become a mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there it really is struggling for
pretty much any doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I do with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cannabis was working so well,
shall I take her off or shall I keep her
[SPEAKER_03]: on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then there is a massive stigma
from the other colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some weeks ago we were at Cannabis Europe
in London and there was actually a panel
[SPEAKER_03]: on women's health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Dani Gordon was talking about the
fact that she was completely agreeing on
[SPEAKER_03]: the importance for women that form their
balance for treating their pathology with
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time she wasn't feeling
brave enough, she said, I'm just quoting
[SPEAKER_03]: her words, to make a prescription to a
woman that was either pregnant or
[SPEAKER_03]: breastfeeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think here it really is important then
to, and I'm sorry, I work in education,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm gonna repeat this, but it's really,
really important the education side in
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there are different,
it's different the metabolism in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: TSH, COH, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between a product that has a
pharmacokinetics, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: through inhalation or through an oral
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an important difference in the
rate of penetration, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the fetus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it's really a matter of what type
of product is gonna be best for this state
[SPEAKER_03]: of condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another situation is that of
breastfeeding, because of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: as some of you may know, in our own human
milk, also animal milk, there are
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of toraquinone in glycerol.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually a great matrix,
a great vehicle for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, most of the time, breastfeeding
is one of the most difficult moment for an
[SPEAKER_03]: administration of cannabis rather than
actually pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you need to take in consideration
the quality of the life, not only of the
[SPEAKER_03]: body, but also of the child, because I
mean, postpartum depression, it's a real
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about a patient that so
far was balanced with her medication,
[SPEAKER_03]: you remove her medication, so you're
unbalancing her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she's also going through a very
crazy unbalancing moment of her life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the day of giving birth is the
highest amount of neurosteroids that
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone can secrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have on the other side,
a very well designed and very nice
[SPEAKER_03]: protocol on benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a good solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I bring this up because we
often have this conversation on the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that even in our medical community of
cannabis doctors or doctors that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribing for a long time, but because
cannabis, as you all know, it's not a
[SPEAKER_03]: first line treatment, then they feel safe
for, especially in the situation of a
[SPEAKER_03]: woman planning a pregnancy, to use stuff
that actually, if you look at,
[SPEAKER_03]: has a much shorter window of safety,
because you can die and you can have a
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty bad addiction with, for example,
benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm gonna add in my own story
with my own experience based on what you
[SPEAKER_04]: said, because we have the clinical point
of view and then the patient point of
[SPEAKER_04]: view.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a four year old and I was
pregnant while I still had cancer,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I was still a medical patient using
cannabis in the US where it was
[SPEAKER_04]: recreationally illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They decided to let me continue on with it
and I was very open about it, but I was
[SPEAKER_04]: also intentional with my use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't aiming to get high, I used very
little.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked on weekly using tinctures and
tried to do as best as I could,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stopped them from sending in a social
worker once I gave birth and I cannot tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you how terrifying it is to go through a
20 hour labor, an emergency C-section,
[SPEAKER_04]: to have someone come into your room and
interview you about your medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: use with a social worker right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You think you're gonna lose your child and
this is something that's a really big
[SPEAKER_04]: issue, whereas they didn't touch on
breastfeeding at all for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was not a good thing to do,
so that's kind of like a focus point,
[SPEAKER_04]: whereas it was not even a concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: The concern was, you used cannabis during
your pregnancy, you told us you were using
[SPEAKER_04]: it, we're gonna test you and the kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything comes back positive,
we're gonna have to take this and see it
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mind you, I was in a legal state,
and with doctor's permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is definitely a topic we need to
touch on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to protect our mothers out there
because it is not easy to switch medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: and mess up, though the already road
raging hormones going on during pregnancy
[SPEAKER_04]: and then afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's an important thing to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I wanna know what the men think.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you listen to the stories,
it takes away your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you have to speak in front of a
social worker after you gave birth when
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was helping you?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still part of the stigma,
this is part of the things that have to
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as Viola was saying,
if the alternative is the men's or the
[SPEAKER_00]: men's, then we should really have a
serious conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am totally in favor of defending and
supporting women for their views,
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The crazy thing too different to add is
that both tests came back negative,
[SPEAKER_04]: so they only had my admission.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the thing, and they used my word
against me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was pretty interesting
for science's sake though that nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: came back positive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys wanna add any last bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have about four minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think we're not gonna ask
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll ask one question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for Farina Hussain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so just a quick question is, in your
opinion when it comes to Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: how long will it be before you'll see in
culture it becoming more accepted?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that we will get it in our
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we will see it, it takes longer,
much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can maybe share a quick experience
I had in Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there in 2015, so one year after
they legalized, and at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the people in the ministries,
so people working for the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health, the Ministry of Agriculture,
they were fighting who had to sign the
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses because it's legal, but I don't
know, maybe I lose my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes a long time to kind of
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is that nobody lost their
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody died, must be no cannabis is not
gonna kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so slowly, there is a process of
normalization, but that's what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: saying before, the importance of getting
together as a lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really look at alcohol and tobacco,
and they have hundreds of lawyers paid to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and defend the interest of the market,
the interest of the sector, and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: still a little bit sometimes fighting
against each other in a kind of too
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really one of the issues also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really wanna change,
you have to go together, convince the
[SPEAKER_00]: media, convince the institutions,
break down all these issues, like a social
[SPEAKER_00]: worker should not go and visit a mother
the same day after she gave birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, that's human rights,
in my opinion, that you're going against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really is a little bit the soul of
the problem, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in general, change comes because we
talk about things, so just being more
[SPEAKER_05]: aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, these conferences add so much
value in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for example, just an example from
Italy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have a medical law now almost a
decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of doctors that we train,
they're over 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're already in a safe place of
their career, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The young doctors, they don't wanna know
anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it will change, but it's a slow
process, and again, the consciousness,
[SPEAKER_03]: in my opinion, comes from very different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of this is education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing is walking.
[SPEAKER_03]: This happens a lot in Czech Republic,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: You walk in a store, and you see from the
shampoo to everything with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: These start to give different images,
so the grandmother starts to not
[SPEAKER_03]: completely go crazy if then the doctor is
starting to talk to her about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it will take a while,
and again, the commitment of all of us as
[SPEAKER_03]: a united industry from all different
aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it once again for Vasco and
Pam.
Thank you.
