[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Xenia von Malzahn.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a pharmacist, networker, and
regulatory expert.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've worked in the recent years with
companies trying to launch the German
[SPEAKER_09]: market, and then finally did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I have here with me today four
experts who can talk about various
[SPEAKER_09]: different aspects or perspectives of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how to get product really into the
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what we talk about.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we make medicinal cannabis
accessible to the patients here in
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_09]: They have complex backgrounds,
so I need to look at my notes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so let me start here from my left
side.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tony Schroeder, he's board member and head
of compliance, let's say, the group
[SPEAKER_09]: compliance at Vico.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he is working then extensively in the
sites to assure compliance with GMP on the
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacturing sites at Vico, such as
Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And next to him is Cornelius Maurer,
CEO and co-founder of Demekan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Demekan is a company who received,
as we've heard today a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_09]: the license to produce domestic medicinal
cannabis here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: On his side is Alessandro Rosoni.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that's spelled right.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's co-founder and managing director at
Nimbo Cells.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Nimbo is a wholesaler and GXP platform
for cannabinoid medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_09]: They license as importer, wholesaler,
manufacturer, and they already launch
[SPEAKER_09]: quite a couple of products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And which he might want to mention later
on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the far end, I have Benedikt
Sons.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's co-founder and CEO of Kanzativa.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Kanzativa was granted in August last
year with a permission for exclusive
[SPEAKER_09]: distribution of domestic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Kanzativa will act as the sole
distributor for the cannabis agency in
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so as I said, for me as a
pharmacist, the story with cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: started when I heard the story of a young
boy who was living with severe epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who had major seizures over the day,
many seizures, and this could not be
[SPEAKER_09]: treated with normal school medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: The mother looked out for therapeutic
alternatives and found medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: and could really tremendously improve the
situation for her son.
[SPEAKER_09]: As such that nowadays there are no more
seizures and he can really live a relaxed
[SPEAKER_09]: normal development.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or he can develop normally and live a good
life with his family without having
[SPEAKER_09]: massive aggressions because of side
effects.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for me to see how medicinal cannabis as
an innovative drug can solve really a
[SPEAKER_09]: medical need is what drives me to support
also companies in reaching the German
[SPEAKER_09]: market in providing access to this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm happy to discuss it from the
various areas today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's essential to prepare companies to
also be compliant on the German market to
[SPEAKER_09]: guide them through the storms of the
federal requirements across Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have many, many federal agencies that
are dealing with, depending on where you
[SPEAKER_09]: set up your company.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really critical on how to deal
with them and the requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's talk about the German market.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw some numbers this morning on how
many drugs are being prescribed by being
[SPEAKER_09]: marketed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to my understanding, when we look back
into 2017 and compare it to today,
[SPEAKER_09]: we can see that approximately tenfold of
increase was seen over the last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those years on the amount of product being
prescribed and used.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the estimations, Alessandro,
for the years to come?
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of numbers do you use internally
or try to estimate your sales upon?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get approached by this question a
lot from people coming outside of Germany,
[SPEAKER_06]: mainly, of course, because if you want to
enter the German market, the first
[SPEAKER_06]: question that you ask is, how big is the
German market right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there are numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the politicians all stated 30
million currently.
[SPEAKER_06]: This number is semi-correct because this
is the amount that has been applied for
[SPEAKER_06]: import, which doesn't mean that it is the
amount that is actually imported.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a short discussion before this
panel and I think we kind of all agree
[SPEAKER_06]: that we expect somewhere between 12 and 15
tons of medical cannabis this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flowers being imported into Germany,
mainly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the actual size question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would be probably the correct
answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are looking into the future,
then it's becoming very interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: because there are many different
approaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a few companies producing
reports on how big it could be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the scenarios are.
[SPEAKER_06]: We maybe give some nimbus insight.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we approach our expectations in the
next years?
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have some saturated medical markets
in the world, being it the Canadian one,
[SPEAKER_06]: being it the Israeli one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we use a top-down approach where we
say, OK, what percentage of the population
[SPEAKER_06]: per year is a medicinal cannabis patient?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get to receive numbers
between 0.8%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And something like 1.5% for the Israeli
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So calculating it back to Germany would
mean that we would expect under the
[SPEAKER_06]: current conditions, so being it flower,
dronabinol, and an extract, somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: between 650 and 1.2 million patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's going to happen within two years,
three years, four years, five years,
[SPEAKER_06]: we do not know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are the numbers that we are
handling currently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our outlook how big the market
is going to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the bigger question is, if it comes
to legalization, to which degree comes the
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization in?
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a quite good source,
which is the World Drug Report,
[SPEAKER_06]: which measures the prevalence of cannabis
consume in different countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So illegal cannabis consumption in most
countries so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for Germany, it's between 4% and 5%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's quite constant through the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So under an assumption that maybe this is
going to be the path that's going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: taken by Germany, companies could adjust
the business cases to those kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is basically the expectations
that we are managing, which, if you really
[SPEAKER_06]: calculate it, are a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_06]: The outcome is a little bit lower than
what is expected by current reports.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you cannot really foresee the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: One argument always pops up is,
yeah, OK, but the prevalence of the,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's say, gray or black market in Canada,
pre-legalization, after-legalization,
[SPEAKER_06]: is between 20%, 25%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every fourth or every fifth person
tries at least cannabis once in Canada per
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to increase from 4% or 5% to
20%, 25% in Germany as well?
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not know.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we can see is that, even prior to the
legalization, the prevalence of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: use in Canada was already 20% to 25%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So legalization didn't really increase the
number.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just changed from black market to
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what we as Nimbus, and I'm sure
there are pretty diverging opinions about
[SPEAKER_06]: this, would expect from the German market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it stays in a medical range,
we would assume we follow a saturation
[SPEAKER_06]: curve that, at some point, is going to
reach somewhere between 0.8% to 1.5% of
[SPEAKER_06]: the population.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we move towards recreational,
we expect that the saturation curve will
[SPEAKER_06]: tops out at somewhere between 4% and 5% of
the population.
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, also looking at the
Canadian market, only because the
[SPEAKER_06]: recreation is legalized, this doesn't mean
that the black market is completely taken
[SPEAKER_06]: out of the picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the 4% or 5%, you always need to
include the black market figures into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would be my answer to the
question, how big is the German market?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, as a pharmacist, I look at the
medicinal cannabis side only.
[SPEAKER_09]: And looking at the setup of the German
agency with the, let's say, domestic
[SPEAKER_09]: production plans, it's clear that
additional importation is currently
[SPEAKER_09]: required and will maybe be required for a
longer time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, Alessandro, you can outline how
different are the supply scenarios you see
[SPEAKER_09]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: But try to not go into too much detail,
but maybe list a few different types we
[SPEAKER_09]: see.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you mean how companies can enter the
German market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's a multi-dimensional question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first, to be short, is setup.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's assume you're coming from outside
of the European Union and you want to do
[SPEAKER_06]: everything on your own.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would need to have a local subsidiary
holding licenses, of course, for narcotics
[SPEAKER_06]: trade, and GDP license, and also narcotics
license, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're importing from outside of
the EU, you will quickly realize that at
[SPEAKER_06]: some point you need to store your product
somewhere, as well as being able to import
[SPEAKER_06]: from non-EU, also within the EU,
and to batch release products within
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: So suddenly you're moving from having a
subsidiary with a few licenses to a full
[SPEAKER_06]: GMP license stack that you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's say if this is the x-axis,
this would be solution number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the vast majority of companies
do not need and do not require the full
[SPEAKER_06]: license stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also goes to the other complete
direction, where you can work with
[SPEAKER_06]: companies such as Nimbus, but also
Cansativa, basically, and others who do
[SPEAKER_06]: have the full license stack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you can lease out licenses,
and thereby you do not need to have your
[SPEAKER_06]: own full license subsidiary here in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also goes as far, and this is
something that what we, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: do with Althea, that you do not even have
to have a subsidiary in the market because
[SPEAKER_06]: a company can represent you on the German
market and fulfill all the licenses that
[SPEAKER_06]: you need, also warehousing and
commissioning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we then look in particular to the
German situation and the changes we had in
[SPEAKER_09]: the drug act in 2019, this is when the
German market really opened.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was proud to find out that this was
quite an innovative step from our company.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's nice to realize there can be a
few.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and for me it was interesting to see
that they go for a similar setup like the
[SPEAKER_09]: Dutch agency with the specific state
organized distribution.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like to find out or ask you,
Benedict, to share a bit from your
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the players in this setting?
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, what value does it bring to have
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a very good question.
Thanks
[SPEAKER_08]: for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are mainly three key stakeholders
that are involved in the process of the
[SPEAKER_08]: domestic cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first of all, there are cultivators,
three companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they were mentioned quite often
today already, Aurora, Afria, and DEMECON.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are contract manufacturing
organizations for the cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, they produce cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: They produce 2.6 up to 3.9 tons of medical
cannabis flowers a year with more or less
[SPEAKER_08]: three different types, THC high,
THC medium, and a balanced product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they sell this product actually to the
cannabis agency, which is part of the Bay
[SPEAKER_08]: Farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the owner of the product would be then
the cannabis agency, which is the second
[SPEAKER_08]: key stakeholder within this domestic
cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also control the manufacturers
when it comes to harvest, to testing,
[SPEAKER_08]: to packaging, and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are the owner of the product
until it is distributed to the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for this distribution, there is an
exclusive partner of the cannabis agency,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is Cansativa, which is us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are shipping those products on
behalf of Bay Farm into the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is basically how it's set up in
general.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the orders from the pharmacies would be
going to the Bay Farm, which is then
[SPEAKER_09]: informing you or directly to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're ordering on behalf of a
pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what happens is that at Bay Farm,
there is no handling of the product at
[SPEAKER_08]: all.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the first important.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's stored at either the cultivator
site or in our distribution hub.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are receiving the orders from the
pharmacies directly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But always we act here on behalf of Bay
Farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look into the market,
sometimes the pharmacist might not
[SPEAKER_08]: differentiate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is he now talking to us as Cansativa,
or is he talking to the cannabis agency?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are the actual owner of this domestic
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: So one last question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you were then actually also audited by
the Bay Farm to check on your premises?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So last year, there was the tender process
on the distribution of the medical
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis from Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 companies applied for this tender
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: We made the race, which was good.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also were audited by the cannabis
agency last year in summer, which was
[SPEAKER_08]: quite a rough audit when you compare it to
other supplier audits or so, what we also
[SPEAKER_08]: used to in the past.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like you just mentioned, there are
different players in this domestic field.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Demekan is the one who is cultivating.
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume you then also would expect to get
inspected.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or by the Bay Farm.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe you can talk a bit about how
high the requirements are given by the
[SPEAKER_09]: license you won recently.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how would you say, is it equal between
you and a cultivator from abroad?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or to put it directly, there is quite some
difference between the level of
[SPEAKER_09]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe, yeah, or requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you can comment on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm happy to do so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, we will be inspected by the Bay
Farm, by the cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we're in constant contact with
the cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a monthly call.
[SPEAKER_07]: They check on the progress of the
build-out, the progress of the
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, they will audit us, though
roughly, once we are ready to be audited,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is going to be at the end of this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're expecting to deliver medical
cannabis flowers into the market in Q1
[SPEAKER_07]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you will have our product soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, are the requirements for us as
medical cannabis producers in Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: higher than for other medical cannabis
producers, be it in the European Union or
[SPEAKER_07]: outside of European Union?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, in Germany, we have to grow
medical cannabis and process medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis in a bunker.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for example, in Canada, you have high
security protocols, but it is basically
[SPEAKER_07]: video cameras all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to build a bunker and grow and
process in the bunker.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is already a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when it comes to the cultivation of
medical cannabis, we partook in a tender
[SPEAKER_07]: process, which we won.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were rated, first of all,
on the price.
[SPEAKER_07]: But secondly, also on the quality
concepts, how we are going to grow medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we could only win this tender process
by demonstrating that we will grow medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis in superior quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from a pharmaceutical standpoint,
superior quality means that the active
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceutical ingredients, which are THC
and CBD, will be constant between batches
[SPEAKER_07]: and within a batch.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we had to demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we could only win.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't win the tender because we were
demonstrating that it would be of higher
[SPEAKER_07]: quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the expectation for our product is
higher than the expectation for producers
[SPEAKER_07]: in Europe or outside of Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cultivating medical cannabis is one
part of the story.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other part is processing medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here comes EUGMP into play,
because actually, we're cultivating under
[SPEAKER_07]: GACP, though it is in clean room
environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: The product then has to be trimmed,
tried, stored, packaged, and delivered to
[SPEAKER_07]: the customer in the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for that, we had to demonstrate that
we will become a pharmaceutical company,
[SPEAKER_07]: which we are by now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we not only build those cultivation
rooms, but also all the GMP area to
[SPEAKER_07]: process medical cannabis, allowing us to
actually build a center for medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Processing our own product, but also
allowing product to come in from other
[SPEAKER_07]: European countries, be processed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So come in as an active pharmaceutical
ingredient, and then be refined into EUGMP
[SPEAKER_07]: product, flour, or extract.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that means the license which you got
defines quite detailed how you produce.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would then also define what kind of
product you allow to be produced.
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of product you bring to the
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would be curious to find out how
much did the B-Farm really look into
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding what our patients needs,
what our needs related to all the
[SPEAKER_09]: different indications.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a huge discussion ongoing
about what type of product is the right
[SPEAKER_09]: one.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you dealing with that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I assume the B-Farm would then
solidly concentrate on the monographs and
[SPEAKER_09]: what's written in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe you can outline how this
discussion goes about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Monographs are kind of kicked off at the
B-Farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have kind of control and direction
how the monograph will be written,
[SPEAKER_07]: German monograph.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also sending impulses for the European
Union so that the European monograph will
[SPEAKER_07]: be in line with the DAB monograph,
the German monograph.
[SPEAKER_07]: So first of all, you have to look at who
is sitting in the cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the background?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're not medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not looking at what cultivar and
terpene profile will be best for this or
[SPEAKER_07]: that indication.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look at medical cannabis as an API.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for them, there are two main
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they basically set out this tender
process in that they wanted a high THC
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivar, a medium THC cultivar,
and a balanced THC cultivar, meaning that
[SPEAKER_07]: 18% to 22% of THC, 16% to 12% THC,
and a balanced one with 5% to 9% THC and
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Terpenes at that point in time were not of
consideration.
[SPEAKER_07]: They become more and more now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is advice to everybody wanting to
bring product to the German market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a look at your terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it differentiate from the other
products in the market?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Bfarm now has awareness of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we are all through my notes here.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I look at the requirements for GMP
production, and I know they then should be
[SPEAKER_09]: added to the GACP requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have those being looked at by the
Bfarm.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have requirements towards the
non-European producers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe, Tony, you can outline what
challenges do you see when it comes to
[SPEAKER_09]: products coming maybe from your site in
Europe, but also comparing it to those
[SPEAKER_09]: coming from further abroad.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my experiences that countries like
Israel now also start coming into the play
[SPEAKER_09]: and discussing or setting their standards
up to the European ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where do you see the main challenges in
this, let's say, non-balance?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what we experience here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe you can outline that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have the famous EU GMP,
and they're very fine-tuned guidelines
[SPEAKER_04]: existing already.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that all European state inspectors,
they're following the EU GMP guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically what's on the agenda on
every state inspection what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: With other words, the European suppliers,
they always have the same criteria,
[SPEAKER_04]: how the quality will be controlled and
stately inspected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, on top of the audits that the
clients or us as wholesale distributors
[SPEAKER_04]: who get the products from the suppliers
in, we have to qualify them as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to perform audits, which is
exactly the same like a state inspectorate
[SPEAKER_04]: but called audit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't see the biggest problems
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is differences between is somebody
producing cannabis flowers or does
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody have an extraction facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big difference is also then do they
irradiate the product to reduce
[SPEAKER_04]: micro-burden or germs, which I will say in
a couple of minutes leads to other
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory problems with B-Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, I can see there's still not
enough product available from foreign
[SPEAKER_04]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the wholesale distributors are
desperately always looking to get new
[SPEAKER_04]: products in, not only for medical reasons,
where Cornelius said very correctly,
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to look into more details of the
medical effects of the cannabis plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: also pointing at the terpene profiles,
for example, and the interaction with the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we still need more product,
and there's still not enough European
[SPEAKER_04]: suppliers that are fully compliant to get
product into Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, we still have the famous Dutch
products, which has also irradiated
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers, and we've got a huge amount as
supply from Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a huge amount from Denmark
currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: But almost on a weekly basis, we get now
also from third countries, from non-EU
[SPEAKER_04]: member countries, a product in now as
well, which gets fully licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is actually a very tricky part
because non-EU member production needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: be compliant with EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all call their manufacturing GMP
compliant, but they don't even know what's
[SPEAKER_04]: in the European guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are the ones that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hence, it leads to a time problem
because the law says a European state
[SPEAKER_04]: inspectorate needs to do a state
inspection in whatever country there is
[SPEAKER_04]: that wants to export to Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we recently had the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica, in that case, they got their
products compliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I was a state inspector there
performing the audit or the inspection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Must have been funny with reggae music,
but they managed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in contact with lots of other
producers in third countries, like
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia, like certain African companies,
states, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're even in contact there with parts
of the politicians, like health
[SPEAKER_04]: ministries, et cetera, and consult them
what it means to become EU GMP compliant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And due to COVID, there were a lot of
delays in the inspections by the
[SPEAKER_09]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they did.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was part of some which were held
virtually in case there's not much risk.
[SPEAKER_09]: But specifically, those sites which are
far abroad, I'm sure they delayed in their
[SPEAKER_09]: inspections.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that impact any of your partners?
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even can give the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Given a company gets ready or things is
ready for EU GMP compliance, it takes up
[SPEAKER_04]: to a year before a German inspectorate
goes out there and performs the
[SPEAKER_04]: inspection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already setting up now for
inspections in Canada and Australia with
[SPEAKER_04]: one year ahead to get these things done.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are massive delays.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with other words, the German inspectors
might be understaffed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about solutions here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has an impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another impact is maybe if I swap over
quickly to the regulatory side of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers that are being irradiated,
which at the moment, the highest amount on
[SPEAKER_04]: the German market is irradiated because
they're being produced in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to reduce the micro-burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Holland, they irradiate with gamma.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very intensive radiation for
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has an impact on the ingredients,
on the quality as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The authorities don't mind because as long
as they stay within the specs,
[SPEAKER_04]: all is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the consumer, the patients,
they will become more and more irradiated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Piki is the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sophisticated is maybe the right word.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Denmark, we irradiate the product now
with electronic beams.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's much, much nicer way to reduce the
micro-burn without having an impact on the
[SPEAKER_04]: substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now what I really wanted to say is the
German beef farm, they have a department.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the irradiated license issuing
department.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Amradfowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a law text that clearly says that any
substances that has been irradiated has to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a license with a license number that
needs to be printed on the label of each
[SPEAKER_04]: single product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's related to the product name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now with everything what my colleagues
here said before, how hard it was to build
[SPEAKER_04]: up distribution channels from cultivation
and all these different manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only the first GMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also the labeling, filling,
packaging, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP and GDP laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go through all these efforts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at the end of the day,
you cannot bring the product on the market
[SPEAKER_04]: without this radiation license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to get that, that takes at least 10
months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a little dossier for a product.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is quite extensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we would like to also allow the
audience for some questions, maybe I can
[SPEAKER_09]: ask each one of you to say one to two
sentences of, then we don't get to the
[SPEAKER_09]: questions you mean.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, then let's open for questions first.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be nice to give you some
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one had one or two sentences?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, let's start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, one or two paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question regarding the
standardization of the cannabis flower and
[SPEAKER_03]: the metabolic content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to contextualize, I am a biochemist and
a medicinal chemist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I teach at a university in Columbia,
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big part of my research is analyzing
the metabolic diversity of cannabis chemo
[SPEAKER_03]: bars cultivated in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have cooperation with different
companies in Columbia, different regions
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Cordilleras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we analyze the terpenoid profile and
try to establish correlations to identify
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially new metabolic profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I realize in my research is that
the cannabis flower can be very
[SPEAKER_03]: heterogeneous, even within the same plant,
depending if you have the top bud or the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder, okay, when you have to
guarantee the chemical identity of a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: batch, I mean, if it's hard within the
same plant, when you have tons of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: how can you guarantee that every flower on
the batch will be identical?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my impression is like,
yeah, harvesting your flowers and
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting them to be identical is like
buying grapes and expect that all of them
[SPEAKER_03]: are identically ripe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not how plant biology works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how you overcome this issue,
this fundamentally biological issue,
[SPEAKER_03]: to comply with the regulation,
which is very strict.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Cornelius would be a good one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe I can answer for the Bfarm.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Bfarm overcame this challenge by
deciding that they wanted all medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis that is being produced in Germany
to produce in indoor facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So full control on all environmental
parameters, allowing for a reproducible
[SPEAKER_07]: result.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is the high pharmaceutical
quality product you can obtain,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there you will get a more homogeneous
product within the batch and between
[SPEAKER_07]: batches.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it will never be in a whole room,
all equal, every flower, every plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can reduce the variance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, next level is greenhouse production,
and there you should opt for a producer
[SPEAKER_07]: that has a hybrid greenhouse with
additional lighting, shading, blackout
[SPEAKER_07]: options.
[SPEAKER_07]: Air condition would be very nice and is
randomly seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have greenhouse without any
technical additions.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are as bad or as difficult for a
homogeneous product as greenfield
[SPEAKER_07]: production.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have the gradients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the reason why the Bfarm opted
for indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you addressed for the question,
are there differences between the
[SPEAKER_07]: products?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, here it is grown indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And currently into Germany, it's flowing
product being mainly produced in
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them hybrid greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering, too, would extraction
or something like that help to create more
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent results?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm a flower guy, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, you want to have a high
quality product to produce high quality
[SPEAKER_07]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a bad biomass, you will not obtain
high quality extracts if there's some
[SPEAKER_07]: metals inside or pesticides they will
accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would also add to that that
there's FDA guidance for growing botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines as well, which talks about
defining your batch size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything starts with how many plants
you're growing of that particular variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have things like harvest batches,
which indicate what strains were planted
[SPEAKER_00]: on what day under what specific
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have to homogenize the batch
enough that when you pull samples and you
[SPEAKER_00]: pull a sufficient sample size,
you're getting a margin of tolerance that
[SPEAKER_00]: is reflective of what it is that you're
trying to meet quality standard on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the ways to kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Mark Slaw with iComply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick question just regarding the
cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like in Germany to cultivate
cannabis is going to be an expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of regulatory agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of electricity isn't the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious, have you calculated what
your cost of goods sold is going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like and how that's comparative to cheaper
imports that are coming up in the game?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you think the price difference
is going to look?
[SPEAKER_07]: We participate in the first tender because
we wanted to be a first mover.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, the B-Farm made a
constraint on everybody that wanted to
[SPEAKER_07]: apply to offer something that allows you
to run your business profitable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had to calculate a price that would
allow us to cover the cost of goods and
[SPEAKER_07]: the overheads.
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually, we were offering a higher
price than our two competitors that won in
[SPEAKER_07]: the public tender, much higher as I
believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were only able to win this tender
because our quality concepts were in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that pleased the B-Farm and allowed for
high pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very informative and well-structured
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much to the moderator and
the panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to ask you, Alessandro
mentioned some of the critical approach,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we heard about some of the major
players.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you just briefly summarize a
roadmap?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a growing and extracting facility
in North Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you summarize a brief roadmap and a
timeline?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it going to take to enter the
German market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that easy question.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the timeline, as mentioned,
you should have a UGMP license in place at
[SPEAKER_06]: some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, in Macedonia, there's also some
political regulatory issues that does not
[SPEAKER_06]: allow exports so far, but it will come at
some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you need to pick and choose your
market entry strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can produce for other companies who
put then, of course, white label-ish.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can white label the brand,
and then it's up to them to enter the
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what is, from my perspective,
the more interesting part is to be present
[SPEAKER_06]: on the market as a brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you choose to go that way,
you need to choose your setup.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you going to have a subsidiary in
Germany as a running company?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the subsidiary also going to be the one
who has a GDP and narcotics license?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you say, no, we don't need any of
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you choose a partner to work with who
is going to be, let's say, your joint
[SPEAKER_06]: venture partner at some point and
represents you in the German market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the setup question that needs to
be solved first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's benefits and
counterindications to every and each
[SPEAKER_06]: setup, which has to do with costs and
benefit and risks scenarios.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then what also the title of this panel
is is how to get shelf space in
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then once you are here and you have
everything in place and your cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: products are sitting here, the question
is, how do you approach the market?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you approach the market via being,
let's say, self-payers or patient-focused
[SPEAKER_06]: who do not have health insurance coverage?
[SPEAKER_06]: For that, of course, price and,
to some degree, marketing is key.
[SPEAKER_06]: But on the other end, if you want to go
the full medical road, I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_06]: heard the pharmacist before, you need to
generate prescriptions at some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to convince doctors that
prescribing your product is somehow
[SPEAKER_06]: better, superior, or equal to products who
are already on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you have to think about setting up
a proper pharmacy sales force,
[SPEAKER_06]: doctor sales force, that really,
really goes to each doctor, knocks on
[SPEAKER_06]: every door, and tells them about you and
your products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a lot of scenarios going from
we only produce and send over white label
[SPEAKER_06]: to we produce and are present with our own
brand onto the market to watch our
[SPEAKER_06]: scenario up to we are going with which
strategy you choose to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to be the more self-paying
market approach, or are we going to be the
[SPEAKER_06]: more and more pure medical approach?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of questions and pathways
that needs to be chosen.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think everybody of us is open to
have a chat with you, because we do have
[SPEAKER_06]: plenty of companies on the German market
who are, interestingly, choosing each and
[SPEAKER_06]: every time a different scenario.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we can see how the scenarios play
out and which do have success and which do
[SPEAKER_06]: have least success.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think one big question we should
address is whether you as a producer
[SPEAKER_07]: actually have to undergo EUGMP
certification.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do, it will take time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony outlined, now pandemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Inspections abroad are difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's a virtual inspection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you have to do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the big question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you want to bring your own product
and have your own subsidiary, Alessandro
[SPEAKER_07]: is totally right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take the time, and this is the path.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to produce, if you believe
you're good in producing product,
[SPEAKER_07]: high quality product with low variance in
sales, in the active pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_07]: ingredients, then you can actually choose
a company in the European Union or in
[SPEAKER_07]: Germany, such as Demican, which allows you
a platform that is EUGMP certified and
[SPEAKER_07]: bring in your product as an active
pharmaceutical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it for refinement of the product into
an extract.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can also market it for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're not the only ones, to be fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is another pathway you as a
producer can take.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
One last one.
Last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question would be for Benedict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, has the consumer taste or the
patient taste become more discerning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that terpium profile becomes more
important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, there's deradiation that's
required for producers in order to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: that microbial threshold under EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it important for cultivators moving
forward to try to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate without radiating, or will the
distribution design moving forward
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to demand that irradiation to
mitigate the risk of products not being
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted into Germany?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, very good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think first of all, if you look into
the market and observe what kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: products are available, you see that there
are products that are radiated and others
[SPEAKER_08]: are not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can get them prescribed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is an observation where we see
that maybe especially in the more
[SPEAKER_08]: self-payer segment, they might be more
attracted to those products that are not
[SPEAKER_08]: radiated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is something where I believe that
this is important to understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: From a pharmaceutical standpoint,
I would be always in favor of irradiation
[SPEAKER_08]: because, as you said, the limits of
certain thresholds, they can't be,
[SPEAKER_08]: let's say, regularly and consistently
achieved if you don't irradiate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my opinion and the opinion of
our company.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we see that there is demand for
products that are not irradiated.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to somehow, as an industry,
find the right way that we bring those
[SPEAKER_08]: products also in the future into the
market that are not irradiated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And do we have the time for each one to
say last sentence?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the time for one or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a chance!
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a chance for one or two last
sentences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very informative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
