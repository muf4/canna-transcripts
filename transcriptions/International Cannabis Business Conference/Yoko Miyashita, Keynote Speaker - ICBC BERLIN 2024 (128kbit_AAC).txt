[SPEAKER_00]: We are very blessed to have this keynote
speaker here, all the way from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you all are hip to Leafly
.com, but they're an amazing website.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all sorts of educational and
informational videos and articles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I write for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm on a couple, I think I'm on some
cannabis 101 videos too, and some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a really, really solid
presence in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all over the world, really,
it's the internet, so you can do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's here to talk to us, and we're
very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for the CEO of Leafly.com,
Yoko Miyashita!
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect pronunciation there of my last
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited to be here with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a momentous occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what's sticking with me is
that approval rates, I read, were 45% in
[SPEAKER_01]: this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: 45% approval ratings for legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U.S., we have 90% of the people who
support legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you, at the federal level,
it's going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Japanese by background, born in Japan,
raised in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our system, our legal system in Japan,
very much rooted in what Germany has done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my personal hope here is that my home
country can take what you've done and
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better versions, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is the first seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited about the advocacy
and the partnership that's come to
[SPEAKER_01]: fruition to achieve reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes so much time and dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of you are in this room,
Georg, Alex, so many others who've made it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish you a heartfelt congratulations
and massive gratitude for that
[SPEAKER_01]: achievement, that personal advocacy,
the years of dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've pushed this industry that we care
so much about forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But soak it in today, because our work is
nowhere near done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That work includes transitioning consumers
to legal channels, creating sensible
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation, solving the complexities of
injustices that have long served,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really undoing years of negative,
deeply rooted stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that work, that work has to be
grounded in education, education about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that's derived from science,
research, and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, at the center of this
learning is a plant, a plant that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: in use for over 10,000 years, traveling
the world, following our patterns of human
[SPEAKER_01]: migration, being put to countless historic
and current uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousands of years ago, years later since
2010, Leafly has focused on connecting
[SPEAKER_01]: people with the long history of this
plant, how it's been used and how it can
[SPEAKER_01]: be used to enhance lives, and leveraging
what we've learned about this plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to learn to share knowledge and
build community through our online website
[SPEAKER_01]: and mobile apps.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our second decade now, we now welcome
over 70 million visitors a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who come to Leafly to research and learn
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in North America, to purchase and
order products from thousands of licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: brands and retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that role we play as a convener,
an indirect market participant across
[SPEAKER_01]: three dozen US states and Canada,
has given us a front row seat to watch
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and regulation unfold.
[SPEAKER_01]: To observe how people search, buy,
and consider and consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to witness how thousands of businesses
of all sizes seek to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that front row seat, we have some
observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen market launches go well and
some not so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In sharing Leafly's direct experience
working in this unique industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's our hope that you all in this room
can take the lessons we've learned to win
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization in Germany and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does winning look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each country and market will have to
define that for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that journey, wherever its
destination, it starts with breaking down
[SPEAKER_01]: barriers like stigma and negative
stereotypes that impair our collective
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to allow cannabis to be a
meaningful, active force for good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for individuals and good for local
communities around the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the journey to normalize and
destigmatize starts with solving what I
[SPEAKER_01]: call cannabis illiteracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tackling and solving that illiteracy
starts with opening minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all in the business of changing
minds and changing minds begins with
[SPEAKER_01]: stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stories about humans history with this
plant, reconnecting people with the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge that our ancestors for millennia
have used every part of its plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: its seeds, its fibers, its extracts for
utilitarian medical and spiritual
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only within the last hundred
years that humans have spread the seeds of
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition driven by a group of powerful
American men who waged a campaign against
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their actions weren't rooted in science or
data, but in racial discrimination and
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So couple that history with stories of
broadly inclusive stories of communities
[SPEAKER_01]: and cultures that have leveraged the gifts
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it was the member physicians of
the American Medical Association who came
[SPEAKER_01]: out in opposition of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or old Japanese family recipes that call
for the use of hemp seeds in a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the local communities in the US who are
experiencing job growth because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how those same communities are
reinvesting cannabis tax revenues in local
[SPEAKER_01]: schools and nature conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find that surfacing these kinds of
stories of cannabis's everyday uses and
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits helps to wedge that door open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It enables greater learning and further
understanding of this plant and its many
[SPEAKER_01]: magical properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the path to destigmatization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opening of eyes and minds to the
possibility that our ancestors just maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: knew what was up with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the relief and efficacy that they
experienced thousands of years ago can now
[SPEAKER_01]: be backed up with science and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep telling your stories that
normalize use and combat cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: illiteracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep talking about the relief that so many
find for cancer treatment, pain
[SPEAKER_01]: management, epilepsy, and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep sharing new stories that change the
narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Alex said, how cannabis is a
multifunctional plant that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: foundational to creating a green economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when a society is broadly
educated, people are able to make informed
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions and become better participants
in cannabis society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be looking to our
governments and regulators to join the
[SPEAKER_01]: education journey and to incorporate that
knowledge into their decision making.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help their citizens overcome cannabis
illiteracy and to invest in and share in
[SPEAKER_01]: science led research that expands beyond
campaigns that perpetuate stigma and harm
[SPEAKER_01]: hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research about harm reduction,
it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's equally important to fund
research and studies that can explain why
[SPEAKER_01]: so many people consuming cannabis
experience positive outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't unlock the magic of cannabis
without varied perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're raising the next generation in a
post prohibition society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are way more open and disposed to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do parents know enough to guide their kids
through the decision of whether and when
[SPEAKER_01]: to consume?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the middle aged like myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: People who are looking for alternatives to
alcohol or prescription drugs to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: pain or for help with sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the boomers who are surprisingly
way more open and welcoming of this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: than my generation seems to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these discussions require baseline
knowledge in the plant, how to consume it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's different form factors and different
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And equally important, when not to consume
it, people need to know that everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences the effects of cannabis in
unique and different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of you in this room know all of
this, but there are hundreds of millions
[SPEAKER_01]: of people outside of this room who don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our collective mission,
solving cannabis illiteracy with data and
[SPEAKER_01]: information, changing hearts and minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what paved the path to global
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of ground to cover and
education is a long game, but trust that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis literacy will come if we stay
committed and refuse to let negative
[SPEAKER_01]: stereotypes, stigma and misinformation
impede its progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: What won't come nearly as slowly,
I hope, is building sufficiently robust,
[SPEAKER_01]: developed channels for procuring legal
licensed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've consistently seen at Leafley is
that the more legal regulated access
[SPEAKER_01]: points for cannabis, the less illicit
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, through research that we did last
year, we found that local municipal bans
[SPEAKER_01]: on legal stores effectively creates an
economic protection zone for illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: sellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to keep consumers safe in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wins, neither the consumers,
the citizens, the regulators nor the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as I said when I started,
I'm really excited by Germany's move here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right to grow this plant at home
because gardening is not a crime and to
[SPEAKER_01]: procure it through the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to ask, are these channels
broad enough to allow those who are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking access to the plant the ability to
get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A Canadian provincial leader once said to
me, it makes no sense to legalize cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: only to regulate it back into prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices and taxes are also a key part of
that access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Priced or taxed too high, consumers flee
back to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more research to be done,
but in the US we found that north of 33%
[SPEAKER_01]: in a price disparity, consumers shift back
to legacy spending patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Governments and municipalities must resist
the temptation to tax or regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: operators out of existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen over the last 24 months in
the US markets an unimaginable number of
[SPEAKER_01]: licensees lose their license due to taxes
and are at the high, high cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance and regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And operators, remember this, this is a
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices will remain high while supply
remains constrained.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the wholesale prices of the crop
fall, so will your revenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So build your businesses understanding the
eventual economics of supply and demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my final lesson to share, and really
this is really a wish list, if I could
[SPEAKER_01]: turn back the clock and redo what we've
done in North America so far, these would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deal proactively with the criminal justice
implications of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, many states have committed to
the automatic expungement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the eradication, the deletion of
criminal conviction records.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some, like my home state of
Washington, we were one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: states to legalize cannabis for
recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an expungement bill, but it's not
automatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is each individual
must go and seek that expungement on their
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a highly burdensome court and
administrative system, so that is
[SPEAKER_01]: practically impossible for people to
navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expungements shouldn't be, the criminal
justice pieces should not be an
[SPEAKER_01]: afterthought, because if you've been
arrested or convicted for something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer a crime, you shouldn't be
treated like a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that there are advocates in
this room who support the removal of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis offenses, and my hope is that you
learn from our shortcomings on this front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Address these convictions proactively,
invite these individuals back into society
[SPEAKER_01]: and back into this industry where they can
contribute invaluable knowledge on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate and distribute this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the arrow wielding cannabis as a weapon
or tool to destroy individual lives,
[SPEAKER_01]: that time has passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time to allow for healing and
justice and let cannabis do what it has
[SPEAKER_01]: done for thousands of years, and that is
to help humans heal and build community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a profound privilege and a
responsibility to be a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to serve the magic, the full magic of
this plant, halfway done is not an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization is but a stop on the long
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you travel this road, know that the
journey has resulted in transforming years
[SPEAKER_01]: of negative thinking into market
opportunities that heal individuals and
[SPEAKER_01]: build community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank Alex Rogers and the team
at ICBC for inviting me here to join you
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm struck by the sheer wealth of
knowledge and experience that each of you
[SPEAKER_01]: bring to this table, and I really look
forward to the learnings that you will
[SPEAKER_01]: share this week and to hear your stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's invaluable to me, that's invaluable
to Leafley, because that allows us to
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously expand our audience's
knowledge of this plant and how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: making its way once again around the world
through legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: She makes a lot of good points about the
