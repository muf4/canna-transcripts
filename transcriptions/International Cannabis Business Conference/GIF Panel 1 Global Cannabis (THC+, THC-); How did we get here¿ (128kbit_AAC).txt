[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks again for everybody joining us and
one last thing I failed to mention the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole idea is to have this to be a very
interactive Beneficial provocative a
[SPEAKER_07]: discussion all day long, but the other
thing you'll notice this first panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have a moderator So the idea is
to give everybody a little heads up is
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to start off with one or two
topics and then from that point we want to
[SPEAKER_07]: Get in just kick it out to the audience
because I think that's the one thing
[SPEAKER_07]: that's going to be most important for you
guys and certainly I think for us So Bob,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you want to kick things off on an
introduction on yourself?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure Good morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Bob Hoban.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an attorney and an advisor I run the
global cannabis division for Clark Hill an
[SPEAKER_08]: international law firm I also own a
company called Gateway proven strategies a
[SPEAKER_08]: leading global consultancy and a company
called Sea Trust Which is the only credit
[SPEAKER_08]: rating system for businesses in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a pleasure to be here one quick
No, two quick notes that the concept of
[SPEAKER_08]: THC plus and minus I really really love
this concept And I hope that you can get
[SPEAKER_08]: your minds around that today because this
is not about selling flour It's not about
[SPEAKER_08]: just selling vape cartridges with high
concentrations of THC and sometimes in
[SPEAKER_08]: different parts of the world We get caught
in that little silo where we believe the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry is what we think it is But it's
far broader than that and we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: embrace that concept because whether we
like Delta 8 so forth and so on it's the
[SPEAKER_08]: same Standbox and also David you saved me
and Davos by the way when you go to if you
[SPEAKER_08]: ever gone to the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland It's a ghost town During this
[SPEAKER_08]: event because everybody flies in and out
so I drive into this town.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't find anything or anybody Except
for this friendly face who helped me find
[SPEAKER_08]: where I was going.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that David.
[SPEAKER_08]: You saved me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You saved me Jamie Good morning,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the president and founder of New
Holland Group, which is an international
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consultancy I spent seven years
prior to that running a company called
[SPEAKER_01]: bang Inc Which was famous for its cannabis
infused chocolate, which when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: that company or started working for that
company We were in California when I left
[SPEAKER_01]: we were in seven US states We were the
number one two and six chocolate in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: and I brought our CBD products into nine
European countries So I've been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry a long time and My dad has been
growing 56 years so I grew up knowing what
[SPEAKER_01]: you know how to look at trichomes and how
to trim weed whether I wanted to or not
[SPEAKER_01]: and my Cousin on my mom's side is DJ mugs
from Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was in law school in 1992 my
cousin lit a joint on Saturday Night Live
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been in the industry in one form
or fashion pretty much all my life Good
[SPEAKER_02]: morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Rob McAvoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm president of the McAvoy management
group, which is a consulting firm to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space Prior to starting my
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was an owner operator across multiple
states in the United States Formerly I was
[SPEAKER_02]: a VP at a cannabis agtech company that was
NACDAX listed So a lot of global cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and formulation cultivation
extraction retailing Been doing this now
[SPEAKER_02]: for over a decade in the commercial space
I've been on the supply and demand side of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis since I was about 14 15 years old
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really looking forward to the
conversation this morning and keeping it
[SPEAKER_07]: lively Thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you guys know the title of this
panel is to essentially look back on the
[SPEAKER_07]: past and So that the first topic we'd like
to at least start out with the panelists
[SPEAKER_07]: is Looking at adult use and medical
Cannabis both here in us all over the
[SPEAKER_07]: world has been treated differently or
dealt with differently What did that?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Historically?
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: How's the treatment been different and
what are the implications for the future?
[SPEAKER_07]: So ladies first Jamie do you want to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think watching What's happening in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna start, you know, how did we get
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we are right now is Germany and how
did we get here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We go back historically and see what
happened in California In the prop 215
[SPEAKER_01]: which was a let's put medical program in
air quotes Which basically was a way for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to go get cards and get cannabis so
that they didn't have to worry about Going
[SPEAKER_01]: to jail and then the industry sort of blew
up from there But where we are now in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, it is a true medical program.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in Germany Pharmaceuticals it's
going through the apotheca.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going with a prescription And if you
know what you're doing, you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have the government reimburse you That's a
far cry from what we saw in California So
[SPEAKER_01]: many years ago and then there's everything
in between the other thing we're seeing on
[SPEAKER_01]: that THC plus and THC minus conversation
is the explosion of hemp derived products
[SPEAKER_01]: that are Getting people high and they're
quote legal THC and we're also seeing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe that there are places that are
figuring out Oh, I can spray terpenes on
[SPEAKER_01]: my hemp flower and I can get people high
we're gonna get to the same Result the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality is human beings want this plant
That's where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it now as you you have more and more
people waking up with access to the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot put the genie back in the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's not a matter of if cannabis is
going to be legalized worldwide It's a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of when and how and these are the
rooms where we're going to shape that
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation So in Colorado back in 2009
2010 we had a lot of medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: minecraft With Charlotte's web coming
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started seeing a lot more firms
bringing patients with very high needs
[SPEAKER_02]: into the state to gain access at the same
time we started seeing other medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana programs open up in Illinois and
in Maryland that started to require or
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to ask for a pharmacist involvement
to bring in more of that medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: check-in balance as it relates to the
products as it relates to the potencies
[SPEAKER_02]: and then of course their therapeutic
effects You know that got a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: backlash and resistance in the in the
Program itself because what we really have
[SPEAKER_02]: is a culture versus a commercialization
clash And there are a lot of legacy folks
[SPEAKER_02]: from the cannabis space who did not want
medical professionals Coming in in those
[SPEAKER_02]: capacities and so with that we started to
see the evolution of more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: municipalities at a local level in the
states open up and create more of that
[SPEAKER_02]: over-the-counter access through adult use
programs and of course then that started
[SPEAKER_02]: to mitigate and you know decrease Canada
tourism if you will for patients in the
[SPEAKER_02]: migration of those patients into the
programs, I think Now when we start to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at where it's going into the future
as it relates to canna pseudocals There's
[SPEAKER_02]: a very big opportunity gap because as
we've been talking about really looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: a molecular and a phyto compound Basis
we're looking at active pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients and so with that and having a
cache of those ingredients We can
[SPEAKER_02]: formulate new products we can formulate
new delivery systems and of course new
[SPEAKER_02]: product formats So I think that as we
continue to start to see the European
[SPEAKER_02]: market opening up going through the
pharmacies going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: extemporaneous compounding process of
different methods of delivery We're really
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to see more of an emphasis on a
strain to symptom and on a condition to
[SPEAKER_08]: compound approach I uh It's important to
know that every country around the world
[SPEAKER_08]: Legalizes cannabis for a different reason
You have to understand the quote-unquote
[SPEAKER_08]: why why did they legalize cannabis was it
because of medical?
[SPEAKER_08]: Reasons was it because of criminal justice
reform was it for social justice?
[SPEAKER_08]: Reform was it for economic development?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the very cornerstone that you have
to understand as an invent investor or
[SPEAKER_08]: operator in this space because if you
don't you have no chance of participating
[SPEAKER_08]: in that region that jurisdictions
marketplace for example Medical
[SPEAKER_08]: quote-unquote using that note that notion
medical marijuana in the United States has
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing to do with medicine Medical
marijuana means this is how you qualify a
[SPEAKER_08]: purchaser.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a condition That a doctor has
recognized it's on a list of conditions
[SPEAKER_08]: and that allows that purchaser to legally
walk into a store possess Cultivate or
[SPEAKER_08]: purchase a cannabis product nothing to do
with medicine nothing very different in
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe very different in Germany as you
mentioned, it's a pharmaceutical model and
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the notion that I don't and I can't
wrap my mind around the notion that in
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe flower can be Prescribed as a part
of a medical regime as a as a as a medical
[SPEAKER_08]: solution Never in the United States ever
ever ever ever is the FDA going to?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sanction a program or doctors recommend a
flower No, it's always going to be an
[SPEAKER_08]: extract in a formulation So to have these
models merge in the future is going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: really really interesting And again,
I don't doubt the efficacy of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_08]: a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what I'm saying but in the
United States Medical marijuana merely
[SPEAKER_08]: qualifies the purchaser the last thing
I'll note is it is important to recognize
[SPEAKER_08]: that the sandbox so to speak is not just
about flower and I've argued that
[SPEAKER_08]: Industrial hemp really is the backbone for
the cannabis supply chain The entire
[SPEAKER_08]: global supply chain in the world can be
built from extracts from the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It cost $600 per acre to grow It's less
regulated and guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It contains the exact same cannabinoids
just in different ratios as a high
[SPEAKER_08]: concentration marijuana plant so then why
would you go through the system of
[SPEAKER_08]: registering a medical program going
through millions and millions and millions
[SPEAKER_08]: of dollars of infrastructure development
when you can grow it for $600 per acre
[SPEAKER_08]: Extract the compounds and create
formulations based thereon That is the
[SPEAKER_08]: future and the more that we recognize that
the faster we recognize that and you may
[SPEAKER_08]: not agree with this But this is a fact.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean these are this is the way the
supply chain is going to develop Globally
[SPEAKER_08]: the more that you can get your mind around
that I think the better position you'll be
[SPEAKER_08]: as an investor as an operator to work in
this industry Two things may bring up real
[SPEAKER_07]: quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's looking at the past the adult use
versus medical One if you know about
[SPEAKER_07]: Oklahoma is crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So Oklahoma is a medical quote-unquote
medical market, right and the first year I
[SPEAKER_07]: think second year they had 800 million
dollars in sales in Oklahoma and anybody
[SPEAKER_07]: that knows Oklahoma realized they don't
have that many people Smoking pot frankly,
[SPEAKER_07]: right and it's meant to be a medical state
and most of that stuff's probably going
[SPEAKER_07]: down to Dallas, Texas Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's this medical market.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually more adult use right and
then on the other hand if you know about
[SPEAKER_07]: the recent weed care program in
Switzerland if you don't you should know
[SPEAKER_07]: about it because it's I think going to be
probably the model of The future so here
[SPEAKER_07]: you have the weed care program in
Switzerland, which is an adult use program
[SPEAKER_07]: Where they roll it out in specific cities
associated with a given University and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's under the Federal Office of Public
Health In Switzerland, but also under the
[SPEAKER_07]: auspices of the UN Narcotics Board,
which is a big part of if you know the UN
[SPEAKER_07]: single convention of 61 so here's a Adult
use market that's actually being rolled
[SPEAKER_07]: out like a medical market and I think
that's hopefully maybe going to be the
[SPEAKER_07]: model That hope works in the future
because I think is everybody here on the
[SPEAKER_07]: stage will agree One of the big things we
need to overcome is the stigma and the
[SPEAKER_07]: stigma needs to be overcome by information
intellect data and and just a clear path
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and medical studies I mean I think
at the end of the day we we put air quotes
[SPEAKER_01]: around medical program But I think the
reason cannabis is so popular is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually works And it works, you know from
my perspective having run a chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: company a lot of people would not read the
instructions and they would eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate bar that had you know anywhere
from a hundred to four hundred and twenty
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of cannabis and If you ate the
whole chocolate bar, you might end up at
[SPEAKER_01]: the emergency room with a panic attack,
but you wouldn't die At the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing that because you're seeking
some relief whether it's the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep or it's pain or it's nausea from
taking chemotherapy Whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: Parkinson's you've got some sort of a
seizure disorder people are seeking relief
[SPEAKER_01]: because the pharmaceutical industry is
limited from the compounds that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: providing whether they're opiates or
whatever they are and our body has an
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system and we actually
need this medicine and so I read a
[SPEAKER_01]: statistic and it varies depending on who's
doing the study but approximately 85% of
[SPEAKER_01]: all people using cannabis in the adult use
markets are using it for some medical
[SPEAKER_01]: reason that's why I know this industry is
not going away because people want this
[SPEAKER_01]: access to this plant so to Bob's point if
we figure out the most efficacious way to
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver it to them where we can as
business operators have banking have
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing and Get people access to this
plant in a way that we can actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: money It sort of becomes a snowball effect
because we can get rid of the Stigma the
[SPEAKER_01]: more people that have a great experience
with it Where they don't end up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency room where they end up sleeping
through the night They stay tell ten of
[SPEAKER_01]: their friends then they try the gummy or
they try the chocolate or they try the
[SPEAKER_01]: vape and Right now it's a global
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an actual industry and in our
lifetime I think the only other industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that's blown up to this degree has been
dot-com Maybe web 3 is coming but we are
[SPEAKER_01]: creating jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're creating Economic development in a
time where we desperately need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of factors
figuring into this the only thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're fighting is fear the governments are
afraid and I suspect that that fear is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from Industry that is challenged by
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pharmaceuticals because they're
wondering well what's gonna happen when
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be taking opiate
They're not going to be taking Lyrica.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be you know drinking
as much alcohol and it's actually playing
[SPEAKER_01]: out to be the case So we're we're a
dangerous industry in the sense that human
[SPEAKER_01]: beings are going to be using this in
higher percentages Just just really
[SPEAKER_08]: quickly just a quick note giving people
access to whatever way they want to access
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is important because
over-the-counter cannabis when I walk to a
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary I buy a flower or an oil that's
one way to access it but It's a whole
[SPEAKER_08]: nother way to go to a doctor and get a
prescribed medication or a formulation
[SPEAKER_08]: that's been gone It's gone through
clinical trials and has registered but all
[SPEAKER_08]: of those things need to be accessible But
that's your point David is this is moving
[SPEAKER_08]: towards the pharmaceutical model,
which is the latter No one's walking into
[SPEAKER_08]: a dispensary necessarily in conjunction
with their doctor they're going and
[SPEAKER_08]: getting a formulation and and that's how
you have to Widen your perspective and
[SPEAKER_08]: realize that patients need to have access
as many different ways as possible even if
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not a Specific prescribed medical use
it completely agree Jamie and Bob and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it has to be Mentioned that there's
an onus on the operators in the program as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter where they're operating They
need to understand what problem they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to solve and why they're trying to
solve it in order to be able to create the
[SPEAKER_02]: physician campaigns in order to be able to
create the patient messaging that closes
[SPEAKER_02]: the communication gap between how this
might be valuable and from there what
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits it's going to have for whatever
malady we're trying to treat and so a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: Of operators are running before they're
crawling and walking and with that model.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not Slowing their scale to their
sales and now the priority is shifting in
[SPEAKER_02]: their business model and how they're
executing on their business plan and with
[SPEAKER_02]: that patients and physicians get left
behind let alone the regulators who are
[SPEAKER_02]: still trying to understand all the
different nuances of this plan and the
[SPEAKER_02]: derivative products that come from it and
I was just gonna say we're in prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: right now So if you study history at the
end of prohibition of alcohol they're
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of I would say danger a
lot of people rushing to get where they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to be or to make that cash grab the
interesting thing about this industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's both medical and it's recreational in
the sense that people use it as a social
[SPEAKER_01]: lubricant as well and so You know when
we're looking at all of that, is it a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it CPG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of those things and so what we
haven't figured out yet as an industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we land?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it going to be able?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we going to be able to give
people access the way they want it?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to kick it out to the audience
any questions somebody want to kick it off
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone have a question just raise
your hand I'm wearing comfortable shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go Thanks for that guys
and Is that close enough My question is
[SPEAKER_06]: what Has gone really wrong in the industry
that set us back and what how can we learn
[SPEAKER_06]: from that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how does that project is forward?
[SPEAKER_06]: To it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, that's the start of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so I Appreciate that but like if you
could pinpoint a few key things that you
[SPEAKER_06]: think have been really painful and maybe
set us back a little bit But actually in
[SPEAKER_06]: the long run will take us further.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if you can use that word frame easy
the easy one and this goes across all
[SPEAKER_07]: kinds of geographies too much arrogance
and too little humility so essentially you
[SPEAKER_07]: have all these people that Jumped in
thought that it was going to be easy,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know growing weeds easy growing really
good weeds not Then you had you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the constellation deal five billion
dollars put in and you essentially I can't
[SPEAKER_07]: be gross put in 2018 early 2018 they
bought a facility in Lesotho, South Africa
[SPEAKER_07]: or Lesotho 28.8 million They sold it less
than two years later for who knows how
[SPEAKER_01]: much right to the people that sold it to
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally and and the fact that you
essentially have these people that think
[SPEAKER_07]: everything's gonna be I Mean, you know,
for example one last thing and I brought
[SPEAKER_07]: this up when Bob and I were in Davos the
one thing that's been a huge advantage for
[SPEAKER_07]: my firm is the fact I understood that
biological supply chains are inherently
[SPEAKER_07]: unstable when I was doing recombinant
protein production the early 90s we scaled
[SPEAKER_07]: up from like 300 to 500 liters and all of
a sudden this protein impurity we're
[SPEAKER_07]: making phase one material this protein
impurity came out of nowhere and we had to
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out a way to get rid of it and
having that experience and you're watching
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy growth and Aurora and all these
Harvest go from like 40,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_07]: grow to 400,000 and about five ten years
ago and guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, well that's gonna effing blow
up and what what happened, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a just a real classic example
kick it over to my colleagues I would say
[SPEAKER_08]: the problem in the industry is that the
types of Consumers that you want to walk
[SPEAKER_08]: into a store and buy cannabis Don't go to
stores because they grow their own or
[SPEAKER_08]: because the laws are so flexible that
higher quality cannabis is grown in
[SPEAKER_08]: smaller batches and you can go access
cannabis from people, you know Versus
[SPEAKER_08]: walking into a store.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate alcohol analogies but I would
suggest that the person that goes in and
[SPEAKER_08]: buys a case of beer or a $14 six pack of
beer every couple of days that consumer is
[SPEAKER_08]: not prevalent in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my Perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know Jamie you you you lived and
breathed it I would I would say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation and part of that comes from
the lack of testing that we you know
[SPEAKER_01]: University testing lab testing so we have
consumers that are buying indica sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that indica sativa is really
talking about the shape of the leaf of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and how it grows But it's kind of
telling people I might be indica indica
[SPEAKER_01]: couch I might be sativa feeling up but the
reality is we all in the industry Know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's terpene profile, but we don't test
for terpenes and oh my gosh We can't even
[SPEAKER_01]: start there because we don't have banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have advertising what's gone
wrong We're it's we're in our infancy
[SPEAKER_01]: right all we can do right now We're like
toddlers stumbling around bonking our head
[SPEAKER_01]: on the table We're making mistakes because
that's what you do in your infancy
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean every company is going out of
business, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what else can I say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's a lot that we could talk
about You know from my perspective I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's people raising a lot of money and
building a lot of shiny things that
[SPEAKER_02]: underperform Because they need to show
investors that they did something
[SPEAKER_02]: worthwhile with that capital but the
reality is is that they're scrambling now
[SPEAKER_02]: to Sell through the product that is of
poor quality in unmanaged environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: areas that now is causing deficits and
with those deficits come Cutting corners
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to your extracts and when it
comes to your plants as well and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know a lot of ego has been
infused into the sector that is of
[SPEAKER_02]: negative consequences and I think that you
know companies have not truly looked
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves in the mirror to understand
what their purpose and their passion is
[SPEAKER_02]: for being in the space and then what their
niche is what their competitive
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiator is to motivate a patient to
buy their product or to be served by their
[SPEAKER_02]: product over their competitors and It's
really business 101 again a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_02]: jumping in really quickly with a lot of
money burning it to shareholders' dismay
[SPEAKER_02]: and then trying to recover which creates
inconsistencies within that business model
[SPEAKER_02]: and high turnover from your employees To
your actual facilities and none of that
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits any medical program or adult use
over-the-counter program I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not an easy industry There is no
easy way to make money and so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people get in get chewed up get spit out
and Leave so I will say that I you know
[SPEAKER_01]: want to just raise the people up like Bob
like David ones that are still here You
[SPEAKER_01]: know kudos to you so Kyle question Is
there another question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go here and then we'll go there Hi,
thanks very much for a very informative
[SPEAKER_03]: panel I'm kind of curious because I come
from a North American perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've lived in Portugal for the last
year now So I've really started to
[SPEAKER_03]: integrate a lot and I've been in the
industry in North America since 2009 so
[SPEAKER_03]: there's definitely been a stronger focus
on Medical here, but we've also seen in
[SPEAKER_03]: North America that a lot of the quality
and the innovation comes from the legacy
[SPEAKER_03]: market comes from the craft growers and I
I guess there's this underlying fear that
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that this focus on big pharma
taking over the industry will stifle The
[SPEAKER_03]: small grower and in turn a lot of the
innovation that we see from the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany's model with the you know forcing
that this is different social clubs to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow their own product could mitigate that
to a large degree, but if we're looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: a broader European pharmaceutical model Do
you think that there are ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: ameliorate this before we?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know run run headfirst into the train
Real quick our perspective on the pharma
[SPEAKER_07]: is getting into this industry is this
probably not going to happen if you look
[SPEAKER_07]: at pharma Well, it's gonna happen,
but not today I think sent people think it
[SPEAKER_07]: is because if you really look at farm
what's happened so the sandwich facility
[SPEAKER_07]: which was Response for Lipitor for Pfizer
Pfizer sold that off like 20 years ago 15
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago pharma companies have been
kicking off innovation They've been
[SPEAKER_07]: getting it from biotech companies right
and the problem too with pharma companies
[SPEAKER_07]: They're always looking for composition
matter coverage on molecules to get that
[SPEAKER_07]: in these natural molecules pretty hard So
essentially the pharma companies and we
[SPEAKER_07]: know we've talked to support.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know we've talked to Pfizer Novartis
Lily Abbey you name it GP has talked to
[SPEAKER_07]: those group.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know to Barbara Dalton at Pfizer event
They still supposedly say they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: interested I believe they are but I think
the other thing is frankly that Pharma
[SPEAKER_07]: companies come from a biotech guy,
and I'm sure there might be some pharma
[SPEAKER_07]: company people in here But you know I
think we're going to be seeing more
[SPEAKER_07]: interest in biotech than pharma in the
industry I Would say that they're not the
[SPEAKER_08]: same industry a Pharmaceutical companies
never going to own a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't want anything to do with it
It's not the same industry the innovation
[SPEAKER_08]: that you talk about from the illicit or
the Legacy market that's for consumers
[SPEAKER_08]: that purchase cannabis over-the-counter a
dispensary is merely an over-the-counter
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary Access conduit has nothing to
do with FDA type approved Formulations for
[SPEAKER_08]: specific conditions so pharmaceutical
companies may own that they will own that
[SPEAKER_08]: necessarily Because it's a lengthy process
that requires approvals clinical trials IP
[SPEAKER_08]: protection and the like But a
pharmaceutical company is never going to
[SPEAKER_08]: have anything to do with the dispensary
not here not anywhere in the in the world
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately those models have to merge So
that's why I say I don't think
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmaceutical pharmacy is not going to
own this pharmacy is going to own what
[SPEAKER_08]: they own But that's very different than
OTC cannabis, which is what a dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: is that's all it is I think it's it's I
don't know that they necessarily have to
[SPEAKER_01]: merge But they're they have to coexist
because there's two different models one
[SPEAKER_01]: is you go to the pharmacy because you want
the cannabinoid as a an Ingredient in
[SPEAKER_01]: something you're taking for an effect the
person that wants to smoke crack Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes as an over-the-counter purchaser
They are the ones like I go into the wine
[SPEAKER_01]: terror.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about another alcohol Analogy,
but the people that are really enjoying
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis Socially that go and they buy
there are they do they want Merlot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sauvignon Blanc Those are the people that
really want that craft cannabis and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think both of those models can exist and
will exist Because you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: flower smokers and you're gonna have
people that want to take A pill and go to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep and they're two different consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it could be the same consumer,
but they're two different experiences And
[SPEAKER_05]: go do we have a time for This question
that was just asked is a nice setup for
[SPEAKER_05]: what I was trying to understand by the
way, my name is Bernie sucher and I'm with
[SPEAKER_05]: essence investment, which is a cannabis
holding based in Switzerland I liked very
[SPEAKER_05]: much David your nomenclature for for
cannabis and It clarifies things very you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, very nicely But I was wondering if
if the panel could using that nomenclature
[SPEAKER_05]: Look forward a little bit and and kind of
map the supply chain that you and Bob both
[SPEAKER_05]: referenced What are we going to be looking
at if we follow that?
[SPEAKER_05]: logic from that nomenclature and what are
the business models that as an investor
[SPEAKER_05]: and as advisors you you see developing it
it suggests that at least from my first
[SPEAKER_05]: glance That most of the capital in North
America certainly has gone into the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of business model Rob, yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that going back to my comment
previous for culture versus
[SPEAKER_02]: commercialization, you know when I look at
a plan I look At an ingredient delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at a widget that can manufacture
Compounds that I can then isolate to
[SPEAKER_02]: formulate new therapeutic canna pseudocals
where the illicit culture grower the
[SPEAKER_02]: protector of the plant sees something that
they whisper to and that is sacred and
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we need to do is look at
intentional cultivation and crop steering
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies in order to manifest certain
compounds out of these cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotypic as Opposed to looking at the
color or the aroma now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying terpenes aren't important
We all know the ensemble effect not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily the entourage effect of
synergistic compounds We've seen it done
[SPEAKER_02]: in over-the-counter and in prescription
medication But in going back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: previous question as well I think that you
know Pharma is very successful because
[SPEAKER_02]: they start with the patient and work their
way back Cannabis starts with the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and works their way forward and so it's
not really the same process and because of
[SPEAKER_02]: that It's falling short in delivering true
value in a medicinal aspect So I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that in terms of the optics and how you
look at a process To give a guarantee for
[SPEAKER_02]: the lifetime of the payback over the
patient over the investor over the
[SPEAKER_02]: physician and over that Relationship it
needs to start with the patient first and
[SPEAKER_02]: not necessarily with the plant going
forward I couldn't agree more and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things I've said repeatedly is We are
seeing this explosion of marketing bliss
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep call Because the marketing people
recognize when they do their consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: Research the people are buying the effect
that they want but it's a disingenuous if
[SPEAKER_01]: you start with the patient first You might
smoke weed that makes you horny it might
[SPEAKER_01]: put me to sleep Because we have a
different endocannabinoid system and that
[SPEAKER_01]: is a fact so the reality you're a woman
well You know then there's that on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use that because I think a lot of
men buy cannabis that says bliss because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're hoping they give it to their woman
and something will change but We're buying
[SPEAKER_01]: an effect and we cannot deliver that
effect Where every one of us takes
[SPEAKER_01]: ibuprofen and it gets rid of our headache
that doesn't work like that with just the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant So if we start with the patient
forward what we really need is
[SPEAKER_01]: individualized medicine because
cannabinoids are individualized or you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to use the ingredients in a way that
You can deliver that consistent effect
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back to the lab testing It goes
back to knowing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you say it's biotech We're gonna get
that innovation from biotech, but I I will
[SPEAKER_01]: really maybe I'll you know in the history
annals a hundred years from now They're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna say I'm an idiot But I really
honestly think that that consumer that
[SPEAKER_01]: loves the experience of smoking purple
flower or the smell of Limonene that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going away either We know that the
majority of people who smoke cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still the biggest percentage of the
industry But I think in terms of making
[SPEAKER_01]: money for investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to be looking more at the
pharmaceutical model So Bernie to answer
[SPEAKER_01]: your question I I don't know that there's
a right answer for how supply chain is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to work but I think if Rob's point
is accurate and if in North America where
[SPEAKER_01]: we got to be shot out of the cannon had we
chosen a Pharmaceutical model we would
[SPEAKER_07]: have a happier investors today to do
things real quick with regards to the
[SPEAKER_07]: supply chain Is I think anybody would
agree that knows cannabis whether it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: phytosaurus or a synthetic or chemistry or
whatever the the method that produces a
[SPEAKER_07]: highest quality Molecule at the cheapest
price is gonna win out whatever that is
[SPEAKER_07]: and what and actually if you guys stick
around You know, we have panelists
[SPEAKER_07]: afternoon in science and one on
cultivation where it's going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're gonna Answer both those one
last thing is to Jamie's point There's a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of genetics aspects to this that we
really haven't looked into because
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody metabolizes these molecules
differently and I'm my wife will be the
[SPEAKER_07]: first one to tell you but I think we're
almost out of time but Bob did you have
[SPEAKER_08]: any closing comments just What's the
future hold as I see it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean formulations or formulations supply
chain wise Cannabinoids the plant is a
[SPEAKER_08]: treasure trove of ingredients if you think
of it that way, it's a treasure trove of
[SPEAKER_08]: ingredients What you take off of the plant
and you put into a formulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the supply chain So how does that
transition into the pharmaceutical world?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's formulations based on
specific conditions run through clinical
[SPEAKER_08]: trial processes, which are available in
multiple countries around the world When
[SPEAKER_08]: you look at over-the-counter cannabis,
which again is sort of that current
[SPEAKER_08]: European medical model It's not
sustainable because it doesn't jive with
[SPEAKER_08]: ultimately FDA standards and where the FDA
is going to go with this Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm not saying the FDA Is a great
agency, but it's an agency that
[SPEAKER_08]: unfortunately is lauded around the world
and its standards will have influence on
[SPEAKER_08]: how this shakes out going forward So from
an FDA standpoint, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: isolated compounds created formulations
and those formulations from a
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmaceutical perspective will treat
conditions over-the-counter cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: supply chain that relies on flour and
extracts from that flour And what's the
[SPEAKER_08]: future hold?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean we saw Germany's sort of reversal
of course with the adult use program
[SPEAKER_08]: focusing more on medical It's actually an
interesting thing because you never really
[SPEAKER_08]: needed adult use you needed a more liberal
medical model that Masqueraded as an adult
[SPEAKER_08]: use program because of over-the-counter
flour when Colorado as an example had
[SPEAKER_08]: 100,000 patients registered it became a
commercial adult use system Even though it
[SPEAKER_08]: was called a medical system because it had
a severe pain catch-all clause That is a
[SPEAKER_08]: quasi adult use system that from an
investment perspective It's what's
[SPEAKER_08]: happening in Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of saying let's go open up
adult use dispensaries and supply chain
[SPEAKER_08]: across Germany and across Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying well No, let's invest in
the medical model and create a looser
[SPEAKER_08]: medical model because it's really not a
medical model It's over-the-counter
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis model.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas the medical model is a formulation
model That's not the end-all be-all but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's my perspective on well the medical
model allows them to skirt the EU rules
[SPEAKER_01]: and Put cannabis into the world because
right you have a social club.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have 500 people patients are growing
for them patients and Then I go buy my 25
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of cannabis and I go sell it to my
buddy because that's what's actually gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen I mean we know this from the
Colorado model the minute you have all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these social clubs open up you basically
and by the way, they also decriminalize
[SPEAKER_01]: possession, which means now I can sell you
or you know, the selling is illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we know it's gonna happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give I'm gonna sell you my lighter and
give you cannabis With it, that's what we
[SPEAKER_01]: also saw going on in Oregon and everywhere
else for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have much more one comment regarding we
are discussing currently the recreation
[SPEAKER_00]: and medical way but what I'm missing is
that we have a lack of knowledge about the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and as long as we are not solving
this knowledge and understanding how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize the genome of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we stabilize our production that we
have batch consistency how we are defining
[SPEAKER_00]: what our Lead compounds inside of the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will never come to a way that we have
really a standardized Reproducible product
[SPEAKER_00]: and as long as we are not stabilizing this
once we are running in the situation that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a product which does not fulfill
what the market wants to see that's That
[SPEAKER_01]: work is being done You probably know the
most about that, but we absolutely have
[SPEAKER_02]: that now We're definitely starting to see
it on a more macro scale which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: refreshing because right now Businesses
need to be more focused on what their
[SPEAKER_02]: brand benefit ladder is starting with your
product attribute from there what the
[SPEAKER_02]: patient benefit is and then from there
what the product benefit is and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: emotional benefit and so if we actually
start to look at honing in on those four
[SPEAKER_02]: different levels of the brand benefit
ladder and then in terms of intentional
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation and crop steering
environmental management agtech and data
[SPEAKER_02]: analytics these need to be valued in
business plans and they are starting to do
[SPEAKER_02]: so because it's no longer a Acceptable for
someone to anecdotally say how
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutically effective this may be
patients need medicine that is predictable
[SPEAKER_02]: that is measurable that is Convenient that
they want to take patient compliance on
[SPEAKER_02]: these products is very important,
too We've seen it in pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: models, which is why we have flavonoids
Which is why we have different form
[SPEAKER_02]: factors for people to be able to achieve
the therapeutic results that they want
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is now starting to embrace it
because they're realizing especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: markets like Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very very old or Washington And
California those models are drying up and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not as attractive for investment
They're not as attractive for scalability
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they're now starting to pay
attention to that and some of our newer
[SPEAKER_02]: models like in Pennsylvania where they had
a clinical registrant license where you
[SPEAKER_02]: partnered with the university we're seeing
Academia start to embrace more in the
[SPEAKER_02]: research and the development of these
products as well unafraid of federal
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecution or lack of funding Which is
where we're starting to see that
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity gap fill and you're absolutely
right that this gets back my original
[SPEAKER_07]: Point about the biological supply chain
does not get enough respect So for
[SPEAKER_07]: example, if you really know about
cannabis, it is very dependent on all
[SPEAKER_07]: kinds of growth conditions co2 temperature
moisture humidity More than that,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very sensitive plant which if you
vary any of those you can have a different
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene and cannabinoid profile the other
thing it's interesting if you Know Jeff
[SPEAKER_07]: Raber who's one of the leading chemists in
the world out of Southern, California He's
[SPEAKER_07]: done tests where you take the same key
Mavar cultivar, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_07]: it and concentrated down in two different
process same process Whether it's ethanol
[SPEAKER_07]: butane and you end up giving getting
different ratios of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes with the same chemo bar So this
gets back to my original thing that I've
[SPEAKER_07]: been saying for years When people are
trying to establish brands brands are
[SPEAKER_07]: built on consistent quality, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what coke made their name on and as
your point brings up It's hard to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: very good brand when you can't control the
consistency And the quality of what you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not enough respect and you have a
good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we need to do It's interesting
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about pharmaceuticals
pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals What's
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing my mind in the US right now and
also in Europe is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: TH legal THC coming out of hemp and that
goes back to Bob's point that you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp for $600 an acre and if you do that
and you are extracting things from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant then you can formulate those
molecules exactly the Same every single
[SPEAKER_01]: time so when we start seeing the the legal
THC coming out of hemp I think we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: see an explosion of the University testing
and all the things that we need to have
[SPEAKER_08]: that consistency for the brand sake The
only thing I was gonna say is this is not
[SPEAKER_08]: my perspective, but this is a perspective
of many of my clients Dare I say the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants don't matter what I mean by that
I'm not saying that that's what I'm saying
[SPEAKER_08]: what I'm saying is the the composition of
the plant doesn't matter because you're
[SPEAKER_08]: Extracting a compound you're isolating it
and you're creating formulations based
[SPEAKER_08]: there on it doesn't matter what plant
Those compounds come from this isn't my
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that's prevalent So so
I'm not saying the plant doesn't matter,
[SPEAKER_08]: but that's the future is all I need is an
isolated kilo or liter of CBN CBD and then
[SPEAKER_08]: I create a formulation based there on that
is unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the future Okay, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do have a question My question is
so you're saying the future is just pills
[SPEAKER_04]: and chemicals and extractions and the
future is not the plant on the pharmacide
[SPEAKER_01]: not the over-the-counter cannabis where we
talked about terroir and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean and that's the thing too And my
other thing too was is it possible like
[SPEAKER_04]: you said expanding so you're saying you
know instead of calling this a Adult use
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a medical cannabis dispensary,
which I think is a great idea And you can
[SPEAKER_04]: use that you can use the analytics and the
people who buy the things and you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: surveys Because I know a lot of people who
keep especially in the early days who kept
[SPEAKER_04]: like a weed journal I smoked blue dream
and this is how I made me feel I smoked OG
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush and this is how I felt about it and
you can use analytics to really get a feel
[SPEAKER_04]: for it and the problem of course we will
talk about it is a different the same
[SPEAKER_04]: strain will affect two different people
Two differently and also you give two
[SPEAKER_04]: growers the same cultivar and you will get
two different Results just because of all
[SPEAKER_04]: the things so I think sometimes we have to
leave space for magic and not always rely
[SPEAKER_01]: on This is how we got here on strictness
and this is how we got here So anyway,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have a few more closing things,
we'll go to the second But thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point and and I understand
it too You know, especially here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany where everything must be so We
have you have no kind of father Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, I guess we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fast Let's hear it again for our
fantastic panel David trailer Rob McEvoy
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie Pearson Robert Hoban You
