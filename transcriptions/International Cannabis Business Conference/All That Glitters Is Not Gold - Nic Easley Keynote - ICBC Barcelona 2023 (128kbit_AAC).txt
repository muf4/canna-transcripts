[SPEAKER_01]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference Bartholomew 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget the party tonight at the
Hotel Arts at 9 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we have discount tickets for Berlin,
which will be in late June in Berlin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can buy the tickets here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nick will be out in a minute,
and there's more exhibitors upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after Nick, we're going to go to
lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a bunch more panels
toward the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're searching for a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a microphone in your pocket,
give it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got them all?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, one was in the couch, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, never mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for helping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, coming to the stage, he's the
managing director of Multiverse Capital
[SPEAKER_01]: and the CEO of 3C Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's going to break it all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always look forward to his talks when
he's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Nick Eastley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to double-fist it today with a
microphone and a clicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special panda, as you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pull up something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a world that we actually get to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years ago, this was canceled for a
big deal, and now we're back together in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very excited to share a couple of
things about the global cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Randy back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually the man who's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll just get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to go, Randy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many emojis in there,
especially, yeah, you'll see here
[SPEAKER_00]: momentarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll get started with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in Spain, which is kind of
interesting, because you think about 500
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, places leaving Europe to go and
look for new resources around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're starting in other countries
is now going to be coming back to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost the reverse of things about
500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, let's go look for
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go find all these amazing
opportunities, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Europe, people have been here for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opportunities are kind of sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civilization has been going on for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not very common that a new
commodity or a new business will just pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up and change a nation or the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much what we're doing
here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to always start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a CPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a financial analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use professionals if you're going to get
into this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the cannabis industry for
over 16 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without good lawyers, without good
accountants, you are completely screwed,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is all brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not going to be right all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't use them and you go in
this alone, you will lose 100% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say some things that may or may not
offend you, most likely, depending
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologies in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just from what we've seen from
working for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I've been in the industry
for almost 16 years, originally from
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, small little place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I was a linguist,
[SPEAKER_00]: speak a few languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got hurt in the service, found cannabis in
2006 in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Colorado is kind of
important because we were the first state
[SPEAKER_00]: to ever legalize medical for commercial
uses, not like nonprofits in California in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also the first state that
legalized adult use of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen this evolve from Colorado to
multiple states, to Canada in 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany to now over 40 countries that
we've worked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just got started right when I got
into this, based on really needing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this worth getting into, this industry,
be it hemp, be it medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having seen thousands of companies and
what they're doing, what's working,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, largest emerging industry in
the history of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was all illegal for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about what's the total
addressable market size, when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: long term, this is just on adult use and
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't including all the awesome parts
of hemp, like paper, textiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: protein sources, plastics, all of those
really sexy things that we love hemp for
[SPEAKER_00]: that no one cares about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly they care about CBD, Delta A,
THC zero, all these other random things
[SPEAKER_00]: they can do with hemp quickly to make
money instead of the long term sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: uses of hemp, which will be fucking
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we were able to overtake cotton and
paper and all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, if that's a total
addressable market of 150 billion,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at those other commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States alone, they say that
the illicit market, the illegal market for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is 150 billion already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the United States, it's almost half
a trillion, 500 billion dollars a year in
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol this last year, almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco, almost 300 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, it's starting, but it's
barely begun, even though we've seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also used to be a river guy in the Grand
Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got off the river, so you're gonna
see lots of pretty pictures from the Grand
[SPEAKER_00]: Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at what's happening,
though, all around the world, just
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, in the United States,
our country, totally fucking illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as heroin, marijuana,
cannabis, heroin, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But states, unlike countries in Europe,
can do what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: States have rights, and they've legalized
medical and adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't be confused when you look at
the United States map.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legal there as a country,
but in the states it is, which we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has been going on for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of us, especially here in Europe,
you think this is happening so slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you look at what's happening in
America, there's social use consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: lenses in Las Vegas, adults 21 years old,
they can go into a store and buy cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other states, there's people
rotting in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry's really been evolving
from an adult use standpoint, with Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the lead, with Uruguay,
Germany hopefully trying to do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, there's a big difference
between legalization and
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization allows the commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like actually able to make revenue from
this and use banks and taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The international medical market is what
we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get patients medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using compassionate care laws and
going through those from the United
[SPEAKER_00]: Nations drug treaties to actually
legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But international medical cannabis,
the thing you must remember, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors writing a prescription for
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an API, like active
pharmaceutical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, doctors make
recommendations not a prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: not covered by insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendations are what allowed the
industry to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything you hear about medical
cannabis in the United States is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different than international medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many doctors are willing to
actually write a prescription for
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, the last like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 70, 80 years, doctors were just told that
marijuana's the devil, it's horrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a narcotic, it has no medical value.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that paradigm is definitely changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about the United States
though, far away, not legal at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, but this is where all of the
revenue, all of the product development is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You compare the whole world and everything
that happened this last year, the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, about 34, almost 35 billion in
revenue of medical and adult use combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the illicit market,
that's the state legal markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, a little over three billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: International medical, less than a
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost 40 billion total, and 37 of it,
or 35 of it almost in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not even legal as a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the states that have done this,
sorry, Texas also has a medical program,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to put the little green arrow,
but California started this in 1996 with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at the adult use in the
United States now and what's happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost half of America lives in a
state where you can buy cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not even legal in the country,
like this is the market where you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what works, what doesn't,
and yes, taste profiles are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every country's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the opportunities and what we can do
in the United States, we're following
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations of each state, and states have
no fucking idea how to do whatever they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They each come up with their own rules,
their own license applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own product development standards
for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the FDA, like the Food and
Drug Administration is actually telling
[SPEAKER_00]: states what to do and what they can't do,
because it's federally illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to also what's happening in the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's happening, and it's happening
faster than you could think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of these markets, just because
they have a program, doesn't mean it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some it's like a 1% THC market,
or like low THC markets where you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even have flour, smokeables, edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as a program starts,
it always evolves, and it always gets
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of how long it's going
to take to get better, how long it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to suck along the way, but eventually it's
all going to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out looking for gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a great fucking year,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you look at what's actually
happening, I'm always talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal being amazing, which it is,
and international medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term will be so, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about all these public
companies cutting staff, cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, reducing assets, they all ran
over and thought they were going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, sadly, it didn't happen to
legalize as quickly as people thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're holding all these toxic
assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, meanwhile, small private companies
are like, we want to be a public company
[SPEAKER_00]: like them, but they're shitting the bed at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to actually be somebody who
looks big and all fancy, that actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: billions of dollars in debt, and asking
for more money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, was that $4 billion that Canopy got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that not fucking enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do a $95 million convertible
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give a mouse a cookie, it's going
to ask for a glass of milk, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make fun of Canada a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are times just looking at the
five-year public market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Canada was the first country to
legalize adult use federally, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Uruguay is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in love with them, but I'm not in love
with Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it wasn't federally illegal,
they could have public companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they started raising all this
capital, but then, like, it's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got less than 40 million people,
and they almost all live, 90% live within
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 miles of the US border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be that big?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a great country to, like,
grow bananas or pineapples and export them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the whole fucking world?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were first, and they thought that
was going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they've sadly mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then look a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, OK, peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, legalization is going to
happen all over the world, and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the entire history of public
companies in Canada that have assets in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at that line, not super fancy
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sad face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's this going?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just suck?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just thought it was going to legalize a
lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought doctors would get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would get on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, giant commodity change doesn't
happen as fast as we'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think about alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been around for, what, 10,
20, 30, 100,000, a long fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking for gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found tobacco over there about 500
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, let's bring that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only weed was addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit would have been legal already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill up British America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they all would have been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this doesn't mean that everything
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means how they were guessing
legalization and capital raises,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of money has disappeared because
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about Canada,
I haven't seen this movie yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last week, there was an announcement
from one of these companies that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually from the 1980s, like a
pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this news, like, hey,
they got approved to have cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this much cocaine for clinical
trials and research and to employ court
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to do, like, not legalize cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone's like, fuck a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed first, now this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their stock just skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been around for, like,
40, 45 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make, like, 3 million in revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nothing company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made more on that one day in stock
than almost anyone in this room's whole
[SPEAKER_00]: family would make in three generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all disappeared because these
bubbles and these news and people jumping
[SPEAKER_00]: on, like, little things, it doesn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a fucking bear on cocaine
just destroying crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to work out well for
anybody, not even the bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as you're navigating this world,
especially here in Europe, think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, don't be like cocaine bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hear, like, oh, safe banking's going
to pass or, like, this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany's going to legalize, like,
let's buy millions of dollars of real
[SPEAKER_00]: estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be, like, just like Canada or
California or Colorado or New York or New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fucking Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't just jump on some of these news
items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, again, fucking Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to say, though, that's a,
you know, that's a tundra swan,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I had to put up the Canadian goose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used that years ago, but I just fucking
love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't do what Canada did.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense, Canada, but, like,
there's a different way you can do this in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, Europe, new opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we discovered a whole new
continent except for in reverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff we've been doing over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But granted, the Netherlands and the
coffee houses and the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, the history of this market in Europe
are blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have been dealing with the same
things that we have, but just you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: had the same opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the Netherlands weed experiment,
these social clubs in Spain, Germany's new
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about, like,
big brother and big sister, I like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: these two, like, this is not like states,
you know, countries, but your members are
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's kind of significant and
not just going to let you do whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about, like,
the population, the medical market,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening, like, German import
side, like, amazing that the Bee Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: started that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Netherlands allowing Bedrikan back
2005, like, medical cannabis is evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe amazingly, but not fast enough
and higher standards than anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems, though, same shit, different
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the public companies here in
Europe that are like, hey, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking take over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're European public companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming to the show about eight
years after Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's looking that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that are actually bona fide
are doing other things, not just weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's a nice picture of Tepeets
Canyon there in the Grand Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, don't fall off the cliff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do the same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same things are happening over here that
were happening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about this all the time,
but remember, December 2nd, 2020,
[SPEAKER_00]: we rescheduled cannabis internationally at
the Commission for Narcotic Drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: During coronavirus, Ukraine voted for it
down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not even three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European Commission literally is suing
Hungary in international court for not
[SPEAKER_00]: voting with them for the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hungary's like, ah, we're not ready for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all said as part of this European
Commission, European Union, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do shit together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just didn't vote to, like,
reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're fucking taking them to court?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck do you think that the
European Union and the European Commission
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to do when it comes to Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalizing adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, which I'm all for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, remember, they said,
like, they will legalize it and draft all
[SPEAKER_00]: their laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we've talked a lot about
Germany today before me, but I'm also a
[SPEAKER_00]: realist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen as fast as you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be how most people
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big brother, big sister, also dealing
with a fucking war in Ukraine right now on
[SPEAKER_00]: your border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there's other things that are a
little bit more important than,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how Germany is going to legalize
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they just do it for adult use,
it won't be like how we do it in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won't be like it's been done
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Germany, you are up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it won't be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're thinking about, like,
look at all the Canadian companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: came and tried to take over Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they just, like, put up their feet
like they're in Anquip and thinking the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's just going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not looking that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selling those assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching over to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social use kind of consumption lounges,
but not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're all medical patients with
our little fobs and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tolerated programs are different than
legalized programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened this last week with the
Spanish parliament, which you guys all
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about earlier today, very much
indicative of what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other countries are going to keep pushing
bills forward, just like in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to hit a lot of
roadblocks or those steamrollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least remember, like, this is a
medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients need safe access to medicine
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But medicine is really hard to,
like, educate doctors about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's already using this plant
and product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, what modalities are going to
work here in Europe and how are you going
[SPEAKER_00]: to capital raise and grab those
opportunities?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I like to help
navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching to the world here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latin America is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at some of the farms that
we've helped to develop and the things
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in, like, Colombia or could be
happening in Peru with Uruguay,
[SPEAKER_00]: with their adult use side and their
medical side, with, like, free trade zones
[SPEAKER_00]: and large cultivation and imports,
well, mostly exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much is being imported unless it's
just for fake news so that they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: higher priced stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, massive production going to be
happening here long-term for medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just where the sun grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same with, like, Thailand or
anyone near the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, major things happening here,
but it's just going to sit, hold,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the right thing, not make a ton of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But long-term, like, where does coffee
come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do bananas come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not warehouses in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not greenhouses in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even warehouses in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa's been a little slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa was really the first big
mover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like, Lesotho, Zimbabwe,
and then you had, like, Swaziland doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Africa's been a lot more complicated
than most people thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, like, with South Africa,
with SAPRA and some of their changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, pushing towards adult use or
decriminalization, a lot of developments
[SPEAKER_00]: have happened there, but not tons of
exports yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely one of those markets
that, like, long-term, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're thinking about, like,
Malawi legalizing medical in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries, the opportunities could
be vast coming from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia's been slow as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand was kind of an accident,
where it's like they really confused
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization with legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did medical in the beginning with the
university, and it was like, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to put you in jail and kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now medical research with the college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, hey, decrim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's like, that's legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it kind of, like, the cat's out
of the bag right now, and no one really
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what to do, including the Thai
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's one of the only countries
that's a PICS country, one of those PIC-S
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, where it's the same
pharmaceutical development standards as
[SPEAKER_00]: the European Union and the FDA in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why, like, Thailand is, like,
potentially beyond incredible long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oceania, kind of been shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna be shitty for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who thinks they're gonna take over
the world from Australia, probably not the
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, in that game of risk,
it's only two troop reinforcements every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's way down there, and you got some
weird taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand, though, like, they will pass
adult use this next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that last time it was shy by,
like, 4,000 votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do that because they're not part
of the European Commission or European
[SPEAKER_00]: Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're their own kind of little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the countries like Canada that
can do some massive things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this takes money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all are just who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, what are the biggest problems
raising capital right now in this space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one, we're pretty much illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we've been considered a narcotic
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an amazing plant that all of our
ancestors have used for tens of thousands,
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands, and millions of
years, and, like, co-evolved with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we made our houses from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sail across the seas with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We write our constitutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our names on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also, like, ruin a lot of
people's lives and put them in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a plant, selling a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, alcohol is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great for society, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only positive things happen from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's fun sometimes, but,
like, fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, how do we raise capital now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Family offices, private institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just saying you're going to be
some gangster internationally making a
[SPEAKER_00]: public company and then not delivering on
those expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you go public and you have
shareholder value coming down and staring
[SPEAKER_00]: down your face, you've got to be ready for
that scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why private companies, I've said
this for the last decade, the private
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that can get in, hold positions,
scale, and raise that private capital with
[SPEAKER_00]: the right debt loads, they're going to
take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be like the Cargills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be like the Nestle's,
but, like, not evil or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, like, not evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, in a good way, like a good
Nestle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's what private companies and
cannabis could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so many startups, remember,
were a startup industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brand new, full of startup companies,
and 99% of those companies fucking fail
[SPEAKER_00]: because business is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people doing things,
changing regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People die.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fucking wars, resource stuff,
pandemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's hard to run businesses,
if any of you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with them every day, internal and
external.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're a startup in the startup
industry, how can you be a good startup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're around for five years,
ten years, you're still a startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not like something that's been
around, like Deloitte or something
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term or, like, Mercantile Marine or,
like, 500-year-old companies, Dutch,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you need capital raising,
start now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan out your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, just because this is cannabis
industry doesn't mean you can just,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone thinks we're going to make all
this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, the capital that you need,
if you need that in your business,
[SPEAKER_00]: start planning that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start actually thinking, is your business
plan viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you actually do what you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the laws allow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because Germany might legalize on how
they're going to, and you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these, like, delivery services with
an app or something, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, what are the key constraints
for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the risks?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you actually do these businesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything that you think you're going
to do in Europe, I guarantee you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say 98% of the time, we've already
experienced in the United States of
[SPEAKER_00]: solving that problem of, like,
pre-roll joint packaging or, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: app delivery, cash management systems,
consumer loyalty programs, greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not some new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not some new fixture that's going to,
like, be the innovative thing that changes
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your new coconut core or nutrient or
fertilizer is probably not that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is an agricultural
commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a food manufacturing product or
pharmaceutical product in a retail
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer packaged good at the end of the
day, and a fucking sacred, beautiful plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, like, saved a lot of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't start this movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to finish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just, like, caretaking it for a
little while here in this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, if you're going to do this and
raise and deploy capital, you've got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge responsibility for future
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the world's fucking changing,
and it's changing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, like, this is called the Bute Fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deep in the Grand Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, everything's changing and
evolving, and, like, there's forces and
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures and heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, how do you actually sustain
some of these forces?
[SPEAKER_00]: You raise capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plan those companies correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got to be ready to change
and adapt with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't, you're going to get
destroyed and be those boulders at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europe is not going to be that
different than America happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in terms of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like, we're all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, like I said earlier, there's taste
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, growing tons of
it, oil extraction from fields with
[SPEAKER_00]: combines will be very, very similar to,
like, other, like, corn, soy, wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: other sorts of commodities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big assholes are going to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have so much time, because the
big assholes want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too risky for them to take it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constellation threw $4 billion into
Canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say that $4 billion is a
drop in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one's in it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in this and when those
changes happen, just like in America,
[SPEAKER_00]: when federal legalization happens,
those companies that have massive market
[SPEAKER_00]: share and position in all these different
little states, because if I grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in California, I can't sell that in a
company in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what grows in a state has to be sold
in the same state and consumed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't take it out of the state for
businesses or people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why, like, each state's its own
little country right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then our European Commission or our
European Union, AKA the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: in America, doesn't, can't really do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cat's out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the cat is not out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Netherlands, Amsterdam about to
maybe take away coffee houses and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they just approve four more times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great song saying, like,
hey, you got five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better be ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only got so much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same panda.
[SPEAKER_00]: That panda's been down the river,
like, 14 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to start going faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to start collaborating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that are with you hear the
things you can learn from other lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we grow as a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, this plant, we didn't
invent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was given to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a very unique moment in time that
future generations will look back at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will fucking judge us if we did
this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this does not need to be like other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is like other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take from those sorts of lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just know, if you're going to look
forward into this in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it just got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not late to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just started the dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's been going for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, almost 10 years of recreational
adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 1996, like, this has been going
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just actually really getting
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely open to some questions
if we got a couple minutes, if anybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: got any.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I appreciate you letting me share a
little bit and swear a little bit and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually what's going on in the world
instead of most of the news that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody got anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to refute something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, enjoy lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to talk to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got any questions, we'll be around
outside later this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Easley, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Nick Easley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be back at 1345.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy your lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy your lunch here at the International
Cannabis Business Conference, Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to get tickets for Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a discount if you get them
here and the after party tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please visit our exhibits upstairs as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
