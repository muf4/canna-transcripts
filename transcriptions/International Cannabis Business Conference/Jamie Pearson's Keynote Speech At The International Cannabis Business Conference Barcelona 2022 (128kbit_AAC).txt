[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the International Cannabis
Business Conference, Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak Spanish enough to smoke and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you guys all so very much for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also like to thank our sponsors,
Grow Glide and Bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great day lined up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have translators available if
you need it, but you guys probably speak
[SPEAKER_00]: eight different languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an American, I speak like one and a
half languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uno y media idiomas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked a guy once, I was trying to ask
him how many languages he spoke and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I want those language TNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, how many tongues do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That joke's probably better in French.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me two more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just about to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our keynote speaker, we are very fortunate
and honored and lucky to have her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how you say that in different
languages, but she's a wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just told me that she has been invited
to speak at the United Nations on May 5th
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're having a cannabis and hemp
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make some noise for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, cannabis is coming a long way,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a felony and now it's an
essential service, at least in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they're doing out here,
but they're coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Barcelona, it's just something to do on
a Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the CEO and the president of Bang
Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's here for us right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, I have a podium, but this is
going to work and I know you guys don't
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Randall, how are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing on the PowerPoint?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to talk about today are the
top 10 things investors, operators,
[SPEAKER_01]: and consumers should anticipate as
legalization spreads across Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I think this is an important
conversation for us to have right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: that on both continents, North America,
well, in all continents actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: South America, also in Europe,
legalization is spreading like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a dinner last night and there was a
consultant, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, 55 countries right now are
looking at some form of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some suspicion that most of Europe
will probably follow the Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations when it goes wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to talk about really
handles both Canada and the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a historic time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a bumpy ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we have to rely on
is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had prohibition in the United States
and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting idea when you
look at the fact that I took this right
[SPEAKER_01]: off the history channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where within minutes of Utah,
Utah was the last state, that had to
[SPEAKER_01]: ratify, get rid of the prohibition of
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within minutes, you can see liquor was
flowing, delivery trucks were filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: beer, and everybody was ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always asking myself, how is that
possible that within minutes of the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, everybody was ready to start
drinking alcohol again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're doing that now in cannabis
because we've got these medical programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got medical marijuana in lots of
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality here is that we're ready for
this to happen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really clunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell you that this story really
begins with roots and suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots are the people that risked life and
liberty to keep cannabis alive during
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you in here consider yourself
a root?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider myself a suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a real estate investor for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't jump into the industry until it
was safe and legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the suits came in now that we
have a bona fide industry and they're here
[SPEAKER_01]: to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's been growing cannabis for 56
years, since 1966, I think is the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 52.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've literally grown up, and that's my
daughter's hand, by the way, on one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: dad's plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all grown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my family, harvest is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a harvest party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody sits and trims weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, I had a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I pick up dog poop or do I trim weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up dog poop because I really
wasn't a fan of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate trimming and I still hate trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was for all you roots out there,
or maybe some of you suits, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a root background, but I still don't
consider myself a root because I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to go into cannabis until it was
legal and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I had all of the real estate
holdings and things that I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I had going for me,
I think I'm just going to give up the iPad
[SPEAKER_01]: and just wing it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Muggs from Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you know Cypress Hill?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's my first cousin on my mom's side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Muggs and I invested in real estate
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it was time for Cypress to do a weed
deal, he came to me and said, would you
[SPEAKER_01]: help us find a weed deal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he had experience with me doing
business because I'm a suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was more comfortable having me go out
and make sure that the band had a good
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2015, I found Bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cypress did a deal with Bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been with Bang ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went public in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been the CEO since December of 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was promoted into that position.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now in seven U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: states, soon to be nine because we're
about to open a couple more states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just signed an 11-state deal with True
Leave, which is one of the most profitable
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the number one, number two,
and number six chocolate in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for a European partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see all around this, I put flyers
that have a QR code on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in having an American
brand, and I understand it's a long game,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not ready yet in a lot of places in
Europe, but you've got to start planning
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for European partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and fill out that QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm going to see if you guys are
awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a shameless promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Bang football.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anybody in the audience that
wants it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you also see around the crowd that I
have a giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sweatsuit that's shown right there,
I have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some more footballs, and I have a
Bang chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of you that would like any of those
things, I've got a QR code, and this is an
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see if this works from the
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you scan that QR code and fill out
your entry form for my contest?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get to why I'm doing this
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, who else still needs the QR code?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all over the auditorium,
so you guys can scan later.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the current map of the United
States of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 states are adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: 31 are medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven are CBD only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two have decriminalized, and the four
orange states are the weird ones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: actually gone so far as to outlaw
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take federal legalization to get
those four states on board, although I
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen that a couple of them have some
ballot language coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to pay particular attention to
Idaho and Wyoming up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surrounded by Washington, Oregon,
and Montana, the citizens of those states
[SPEAKER_01]: just have to cross a border.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Wyoming, when Montana went wreck on
January 1st of this year, 85% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: transactions in the southern part of
Montana were Wyoming residents because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to track them.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is clear, and legalization has been
sweeping the United States since 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when California went medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I jumped into the industry in 2014,
there were four wreck states.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2015, four more went wreck,
and that was the year that everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: considered the tipping point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're seeing in Europe is Malta went
wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany signaled it's going wreck,
and you're starting to see the same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have the benefit of this as your
playbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk to you about the things
that you need to know so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: educate the people in your communities to
not repeat the mistakes that really
[SPEAKER_01]: swimming upstream hard row we had to hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I'll tell you is when you
have 46 states with some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, Clarence Thomas,
our Supreme Court Justice, the most
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative Supreme Court Justice we
have, this is his quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in a dissenting opinion about
cannabis, and he is basically saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't have it both ways, federal
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't look the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let states have states' rights,
and then when it comes to the feds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get to do these cash grabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to raid people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to take their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to take their equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, there's going to be a
lawsuit that'll get it to the Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court, or they'll pass safe banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress will pass it, or there'll be some
sort of a vote, but we are in the process
[SPEAKER_01]: of, we in the industry, of this balancing
act, of waiting for legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some of the things that we have
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm calling them expectations,
things that you can expect are coming as
[SPEAKER_01]: we legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, there's competing interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have consumers and the authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authorities are scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your governments are afraid, and medical
people are afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors don't learn about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine in the US, 44 states in America
wake up with some form of legal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know anything about the cross
indications of drugs, interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't say we don't know
anything, thanks to Ralph Michalem and
[SPEAKER_01]: people in Israel and people in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to learn more and more,
but we have so much to learn about what
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never stopped using it, and it's time
for all of us to get the government and
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical professionals on board,
because it's better for us, it's safer for
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's some more competing interests,
the roots and the suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots want a seat at the table,
and they deserve a seat at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily that the suits don't
want them, but there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: assumptions people make.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots assume that the suits are just
doing cash grab, but I'm gonna tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the suits that are in right now have left
some cushy jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people that left Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They left Constellation Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They left Kellogg's to jump into an
industry that is not quite legal yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is they're a little edgy,
or they're cannabis fans, and they see
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry going somewhere,
and they know that cannabis makes people
[SPEAKER_01]: feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the suits jumping in,
and they're a little edgy, and the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: deciding that, oh, they don't know
anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to teach them everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming that everyone in cannabis is a
bunch of stoners, they don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing, we're gonna have to teach
them about KPIs, and we're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_01]: teach them how to do business,
but the reality is, I have a guy on my
[SPEAKER_01]: team that did 13 years in prison,
and 11 years of that was in solitary
[SPEAKER_01]: confinement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran his cannabis business from solitary
confinement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna teach that guy much about
running a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot to teach me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have to stop making assumptions,
and finally, federal, state, and local
[SPEAKER_01]: authorities have competing interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants that tax dollar,
and everybody wants that glory,
[SPEAKER_01]: but none of them want to take the risk of
doing something unpopular, and it's our
[SPEAKER_01]: job to educate them that this is popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not unique to America.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a drug war across the globe,
and it's not been a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a war on race, and let's be very
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no difference, and this is
statistically proven, and I will tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: White people, black people, and brown
people use cannabis at the same rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but black and brown people are four times
more likely to be arrested for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 40,000 black and brown people
sitting in prison in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the roots that have given their
life and their liberty for all of us to be
[SPEAKER_01]: here with an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social equity is a conversation that needs
to be had, and the roots should have a
[SPEAKER_01]: seat at the table, and social equity is
the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a moral imperative, and what I would
challenge all of you, and what we do at
[SPEAKER_01]: BANG, is we give a portion of our profits
every month to The Last Prisoner Project
[SPEAKER_01]: to get some of these people, all of them,
out of prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be nobody in prison for
possession of a plant that grows in nature
[SPEAKER_01]: while we're out making millions of
dollars, and so I'm saying to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm challenging each one of you,
incorporate that into your business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumer demand is always grossly
underestimated, and what happens then is
[SPEAKER_01]: the governmental authorities, you can
count on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They underestimate the demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give enough licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to dip their toe in the water
rather than saying, ooh, let's embrace
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never gone away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's still using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a talk with a gentleman out in
the foyer cliff who said, oh, South
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa's got a big market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we all do.
[SPEAKER_01]: America has a big illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada had a big illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: South American countries had big illicit
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe's had a big illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis never went away, and if they
don't put a lot of licenses at every level
[SPEAKER_01]: of the supply chain, you're gonna end up
with bottlenecks, and what we've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: across the United States is the
bottlenecks happen wherever there aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: enough licenses, and now I'm gonna tell
you how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some form or fashion, the recreational
cannabis will get to the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they're gonna say, the whole MG,
we didn't do this right, and they run out
[SPEAKER_01]: of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not happened differently anywhere in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single state that went wreck
underestimated the amount of product they
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to need, and then the
legislators go, oh, tax dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna meet demand, and then they
open up cultivation, and then cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: explodes, and then what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: We end up with a glut, so I'm thinking
specifically about Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: These places where there's a glut of
supply now because cultivation exploded
[SPEAKER_01]: because they realized they didn't have
enough cannabis to meet demand,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's when the market speaks,
because eventually the good operators
[SPEAKER_01]: operate, or the people that have deep
pockets, and the operators that aren't so
[SPEAKER_01]: good don't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Takes about three years, depending on the
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can take longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimum three years, you'll start to see
the supply chain normalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that you can expect
because they're going to underestimate the
[SPEAKER_01]: demand, and in Europe, I think the numbers
I'm seeing come out in some of these trade
[SPEAKER_01]: publications, Prohibition Partners and
Leafly, they are way underestimating the
[SPEAKER_01]: demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys are gonna be surprised at
how big the European market's gonna end up
[SPEAKER_01]: being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expectation number four, the bottlenecks
will be local.
[SPEAKER_01]: This always happens because when we talk
about the federal and state and local
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators, it won't be the European
Union that's gonna screw up cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be the school board in
Stuttgart or some little town that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: go, not in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's NIMBY.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't coin that, but we use that in
cannabis in America a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NIMBY effect, not in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like, hang on a second,
we want this, but why don't you do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll watch and we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where you guys come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to teach the people at the local
level that everybody wants this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody dies from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always see the media talking about,
oh, in America, Halloween candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people giving the medicated candy
to children.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always laugh and usually go on record
and say, a bang chocolate bar costs $20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, nobody's buying a $20
chocolate bar and forgetting and handing
[SPEAKER_01]: it to some child on a trick-or-treating
expedition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year, they're just peddling fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to keep the media from peddling
fear and start peddling solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have to stop really buying into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to start educating about things
like, when cannabis is legal, the age of
[SPEAKER_01]: onset goes up, so kids start waiting more
and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to get cannabis for a kid when
it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids don't buy beer in the middle school
bathroom, but they can buy cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle school bathroom, but in states
where it's legal, it's really hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Domestic violence goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drunk driving goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wellness goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our communities at the local level need to
embrace this, not just because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: tax grab, but because it improves wellness
in our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fear is the most powerful force in the
fight against prohibition, and our job is
[SPEAKER_01]: to fight the stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first two years I was in cannabis,
I really didn't want people to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still kind of worried, like,
how was this going to impact my business,
[SPEAKER_01]: my real estate business?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people say, well, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand in cannabis, and then a discussion
ensues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be loud, be proud, be out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fight this fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of ignorance about potency,
about the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_01]: about technology, and about the industry
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are still talking about indica and
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are thinking that 10 milligrams is
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a tolerance, 10 milligrams
doesn't affect a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using cannabis for a medical
reason, to sleep, or for seizure disorder,
[SPEAKER_01]: or for cancer, for nausea, a 10 milligram
dose isn't enough, and yet that's the dose
[SPEAKER_01]: that most municipalities and states
recommend as the starting dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The media has an aversion to facts,
and boy, we know this in all areas of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, but we need to educate and demand
better from our media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect a time suck, and expect a green
tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's going to cost 10 times
more, and everything's going to take 10
[SPEAKER_01]: times longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not fund the government offices
with enough people, so when the
[SPEAKER_01]: application for those licenses comes open,
they're going to have a stack of licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take forever to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, you're going to figure out that
you need this particular spot for your
[SPEAKER_01]: retail shop, and you're going to pay rent
for months and months and months while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're waiting for your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does any of this sound familiar to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It costs 10 times more because everybody's
on a learning curve, so you want to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: zoning consultant to come in and help you
figure out your zoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The zoning consultant that knows cannabis
may not know the rules where you live,
[SPEAKER_01]: so part of this is understand when you're
planning and when you're making your
[SPEAKER_01]: business plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect things to take longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect things to be more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of companies start and fail because
they underestimate what it's going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: and how long it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab testing inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can expect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Canada, there is very little
regulation about how a standard lab is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to test cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have different equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them calibrate differently,
and what ends up happening is that you end
[SPEAKER_01]: up having different results, and it can
really... Lab testing has bankrupted
[SPEAKER_01]: companies because they've put a crop out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't test right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to destroy it, throw it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, it ends up on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each step in the supply chain is an
opportunity to tax, and what happens is
[SPEAKER_01]: they say, we're going to have you lab
test, and we're going to tax cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to lab test, and we're
going to tax the extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to lab test, and we're
going to tax the manufactured product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to lab test the final
product before it goes to the retail shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to tax it there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we're going to tax distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what you have is, because of this lab
testing situation, because let's be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest, you only need one lab test to know
that the product is no pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: no mold, no heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to test it at every function,
at every juncture of the supply chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but that's usually what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the guise of safety, consumers bear
the brunt of that cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They go back to the illicit market where
the product's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not lab tested, but what we're trying
to do under the guise of safety is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: driving people to the product that's
probably dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_01]: What time is it?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metaverse, crypto, and NFTs are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies are selling cannabis in the
metaverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to burn through this one
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want you all to know that if you're
building cannabis brands in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is where cannabis brands in America
are going, be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Job creation and tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry created 450,000 jobs in
2021 last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In comparison, the financial sector
created 145,000 and construction did
[SPEAKER_01]: 165,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about countries like Greece
that have an ailing ag sector,
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine what the cultivation will do for
those countries and the jobs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be created in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tax revenue numbers are reported from
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really reported from all of
the employment tax that comes through all
[SPEAKER_01]: those jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data never counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ancillary, that 450,000 jobs, those are in
the cannabis industry, but think about the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyers and the accountants and the
bankers and the people that are selling
[SPEAKER_01]: tables and lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also part of the cannabis industry
and those aren't even counted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge opportunity for
governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data collection, which is why I had you
guys give me your QR code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know a bunch of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be able to communicate with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are buying everything now on their
phones because of COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Online shopping exploded, cannabis
delivery exploded, and phones track
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior, location, and preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe me, everybody's buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you get that little terms of
agreement and you agree to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are agreeing to share your data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's buying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you know that when you're
searching for a mattress on Google,
[SPEAKER_01]: the next thing you know when you're on
Instagram or you're on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_01]: mattresses are popping in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be collecting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build a data collection model in your
business plan because the data is the key
[SPEAKER_01]: to effective marketing because you got to
market to people on their phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are not going on their desktops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about what's coming
with crypto, data collection is king.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maverick, innovator, aspirational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three words I think of when
I think about all the people in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is who the cannabis industry is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our industry is full of people that are
blazing this trail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so proud of all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to be part of this industry
because we're not going to shy away from
[SPEAKER_01]: what's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not going to allow fear to let us
be pushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We walk into the face of this fear,
and we're going to help end cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to leave you with this quote
from Eleanor Roosevelt.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I landed in Barcelona two days ago,
it was International Women's Day,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I felt like this was apropos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gain strength, courage, and confidence
by every experience in which you really
[SPEAKER_01]: stop to look fear in the face and do the
thing you think you cannot do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Pearson, one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very soft spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a loud person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Pearson, I'm sure you can talk to
her later.
