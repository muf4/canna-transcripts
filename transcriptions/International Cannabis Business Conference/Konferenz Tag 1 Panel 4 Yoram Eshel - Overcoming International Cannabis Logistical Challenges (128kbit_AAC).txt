[SPEAKER_00]: תודה רבה.
[SPEAKER_00]: יום טוב, אני מקווה שאתם הולכים לצלם טוב.
[SPEAKER_00]: קודם כך, בואו נתחיל, בואו נמצא איזושהי
פמיליאריטה.
[SPEAKER_00]: מי כאן מגרמניה?
[SPEAKER_00]: תכניס את זה.
[SPEAKER_00]: מי כאן מאוסטרליה?
[SPEAKER_00]: מי כאן מאוסטרליה?
[SPEAKER_00]: מי כאן מאישראל?
[SPEAKER_00]: אוקיי.
[SPEAKER_00]: מי כאן מקנדה?
[SPEAKER_00]: טוב.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז אני אגיד לך למה אני אגיד את זה.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז, אני יורם אשאל.
[SPEAKER_00]: עפן תל-אולי, כבר 4.5 שנה, אני היה יד גלובי
הספייבצי ולוגיסטיקה של תאווי פמוסטיקה,
[SPEAKER_00]: אתם יודעים, הכי גנאיית בצורה בעולם.
[SPEAKER_00]: ואני היה בגלל כל התאווי פמוסטיקה,
אז אני כאן מגרמניה.
[SPEAKER_00]: והבקשה שלי היה באמת לגרם כל הכתוביות,
הכתוביות, אתם יודעים, ההתקנות של התאווי
[SPEAKER_00]: פמוסטיקה לעולם המדיקאי.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז, אתם יכולים לבין, שאם אתם הולכים עוד
4.5 שנה, יד גלובי, הרבה שאתם הולכים לעולם
[SPEAKER_00]: על מידי חוקות והמדיון והמדיון,
אבל אף אחד לא חשב על לוגיסטיקה,
[SPEAKER_00]: אבל נבנתי לדבר עם אנשים על להשיב�,
להשיב�, קנובי, איך שיש, אף אחד לא comprend
[SPEAKER_00]: את מה שעושה.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז, עד כך, ערשנו 65,000 קולות קנובי,
מה וראש, מהר מהר, קנובי, ונדבר על זה een
[SPEAKER_00]: קל.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז, זה כל מהי.
[SPEAKER_00]: קליה על קנבי-לוג.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז אנחנו עיינים במהלך המקומות בעולם,
אנחנו עיינים הרבה לוגיסטיקה ואינפורט
[SPEAKER_00]: ואינספורט, קנדה, ארה'ה, אוגוואי,
קולומביה, המקסיקו, קטנים באפריקה כמו
[SPEAKER_00]: יוגנדה, לסוטו, סת-אפריקה, הרבה קטנים בארה
'ה, ארה'ה, וכן אחרים, כמו שאתם יכולים
[SPEAKER_00]: לראות, אנחנו עיינים על 70-80% של כל
האינפורט ואינספורט של ישראל ונזילנד.
[SPEAKER_00]: וכן אחר כך.
[SPEAKER_00]: והבקשה הכי טוב כאן, בבקשה, זה נוי הפרטנשיפ
של QCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: QCS היא פרטנשיפה גרמנית, מיוחדת
בפומוסוטיקה, אבל גם בקנאביס.
[SPEAKER_00]: יש 15 עבורים בקנאביס, ובכני עבורים,
אנחנו עושים הרבה עבורים בקנאביס,
[SPEAKER_00]: שזה בברלין ובפרנקפורט.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז בגבי QCS, בגבי אוליבר, תודה רבה.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז אנחנו נדבר היום על פעמים דברים,
אוקיי?
[SPEAKER_00]: נציגים להבין מה קבע בגבי הקרן,
ואני אומר, נציגים להבין, אני בבין שצריך
[SPEAKER_00]: להבין כל מה.
[SPEAKER_00]: ואז נדבר על, אתם יודעים, מה זה עשית
המקורות, מה שקרה בעולם.
[SPEAKER_00]: ואז נדבר על איך לשים כולתי ונקרות,
ואף נכון, נדבר על שם ולא, כשאתם הולכים
[SPEAKER_00]: לברנקפורט.
[SPEAKER_00]: אז כשנדבר על לוגיסטיקה בקנאביס,
כמו כשאתם יכולים להראות, יש 6 חלקים
[SPEAKER_00]: גדולים.
[SPEAKER_00]: הראשון הוא הרגולטורי.
[SPEAKER_00]: תשמעו שאני אעשה לך מי עושה את זה
מהאוסטרליה?
[SPEAKER_00]: מי עושה את זה מהאוסטרליה?
[SPEAKER_00]: אז הם עושים לך ענק, אחרי פרסיונות שלי,
תשמחו, תשמחו, כי כבר בגלל הזאת,
[SPEAKER_00]: יש להם חלקים גדולים, ואני לא חושב שכולם
מבין את החלקים.
[SPEAKER_00]: גם בגרמניה, נשמעו הרבה חלקים כאן בגרמניה,
לא חושב שכולם מבין את זה.
[SPEAKER_00]: זה אחד של החליקים הגדולים שלו,
לתחיל את החלקים הכל כבר נכנסים.
[SPEAKER_00]: ובכן חשבים, amph, you will see written
regulations, but in practice, it works
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not necessarily a connection
between what is written in the regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what is practically work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is around quality
assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, medical cannabis is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the government in the world will
consider it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave aside the Canadian guys that
understand that there is, what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use, or, אני לא יודע, נתקנות,
אני אביב הרבה נשאירות, רק בקנדה.
[SPEAKER_00]: כל הראשון של העולם הוא קנאביס מדיקאי.
[SPEAKER_00]: עכשיו, אולי תלמיד בקנדה.
[SPEAKER_00]: ואם הוא קנאביס מדיקאי, הוא בקנדה.
[SPEAKER_00]: ואם הוא קנאביס מדיקאי, אתה צריך להתאביר
לצמחים פרימוסיטיים, לא רואה מה.
[SPEAKER_00]: אדם של המקורות, בגלל קנדה, תאביר לך לעשות
משהו, לגלל שזה מדיקאי.
[SPEAKER_00]: סבבה, יש סטייל כאן, אקספרטיז.
[SPEAKER_00]: אתה יותר יודע מה שאתה עושה, אוקיי?
[SPEAKER_00]: בקנאביס, אתה שיר את זה, ימי, אתה נשאיר את
זה, אתה נשאיר לתחילת המחקר, אם אתה לא יכול
[SPEAKER_00]: להחליט, אתה יכול להחליט ביי.
[SPEAKER_00]: זה יעשה לתחליטה, ואתה תעריכי על התחליטה,
אז יש כאן לאי-בק.
[SPEAKER_00]: אם אתה לא עושה את הדברים הכי טובים,
ואתה לא תעשי את הדברים הכי טובים,
[SPEAKER_00]: זה לא יעשה.
[SPEAKER_00]: סבבה, לא פעמים, יש some countries that
were not even moving one leaf or one
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, unless we have armed escort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some countries we don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But security is an important point,
and we will talk about loss prevention as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: On time delivery, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about sensitive cargo,
we're talking about temperature control.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you delayed somewhere for a few days,
you may lose the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better understand the procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing is global.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, most of the cannabis today,
or was more or less in country,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada was a big market, nobody even
thought about export.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everybody wants to export.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being global, understand what's going
on, we'll open new markets for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some news.
[SPEAKER_00]: New regulations in Australia, we were just
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, very unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to change in this Saturday,
whether it goes with bulk products or
[SPEAKER_00]: packed products, or what exactly they will
get GACP, or they will get just EUGMP,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they have some agreements with some
countries, not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: New opportunities in Thailand,
I don't want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are talking about Thailand
at that point of life, just forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not legal to import into Thailand,
and there's no government, maybe they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: change the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of input into Thailand, not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do non-legal stuff,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, new EUGMP facilities, we see more
and more EUGMP facilities in Portugal,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Malta, some other places, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry challenges in Canada,
we all know what's going on in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel is facing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies are closed, some companies
are merged, some companies do acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware that you know what's going on in
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization in Germany, I'm not going to
talk about it, in Israel they are
[SPEAKER_00]: considering to change the rules,
and additional European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beside Germany, a little bit UK,
a little bit Switzerland, we want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the markets developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did here is I just copied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You Google cannabis, legal cannabis or
legal medical cannabis, so you will find a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A map like this, the left side is
recreational, the right side is medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will find a map like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you keep Googling it, you will find
more maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that there is any connection
between the maps, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason and the main point I'm
trying to take here is make sure because
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulations are ever-changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you know today will not be there
tomorrow, and there are many examples for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about regulations,
make sure that you understand the right
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, the current right picture,
and not a lot of stories because the maps
[SPEAKER_00]: are not telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same things when it comes to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can someone explain me what is legal and
what is not legal and what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical, which countries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Europe looks like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Europe looks like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, regulations are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure that you fully
understand where it's legal and where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll talk later on two words about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking here about medical cannabis
that contain THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we need to understand
that according to the UN, the UN
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution from 1961 forced every country,
each country that want to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to have a specific unit in their
government to deal with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example of all those
authorized, well, regulators, if I can
[SPEAKER_00]: call it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the guys that you will get all
the licenses that you need to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: to store, to manufacture, to whatever,
and also the import and export permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those guys has its own
procedures, its own documents,
[SPEAKER_00]: its own application, and each one of them
will take different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these guys will issue you an
import permit or an export permit in two
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, it will take six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better understand which one of the
guys of those regulatory agencies you are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with, what are the procedure,
how you can speed it up, and each country
[SPEAKER_00]: is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, medical cannabis is a
pharmaceutical product, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every country has its own regulations all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we have to talk about
is the type of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Cannabilog, we are moving all those
type of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be genetics, it can be seeds,
it can be tissue cultures, it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings or clones, which is a completely
different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know, but when you
ship a clone, unrooted clone, it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: life expectancy of three, four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three, four days, if it doesn't get
into the water, it's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very, very strict protocol
how to ship clones or cuttings or tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of those products will have a
specific solution or specific logistics
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, but also in terms of licensing,
in terms of import regulations and export
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some countries have to involve the
Ministry of Agriculture, not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ministry of Health, but a lot of issues to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dried flowers, APIs, or I call it APIs
because from the pharma I mean extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, packed, finished, good cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbal medicines, CBD products,
we'll talk about it in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smokeable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these guys, of these types,
will have a different logistics solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and different regulations that you need to
adhere to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you are in the business,
you have to understand it and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just shipping it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not T-shirts from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, okay, I have two pallets on my
ramp, just ship it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: GDPDR and GDP is the good distribution
practices, something that goes together
[SPEAKER_00]: with quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, pharma standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are dealing with medical cannabis,
you are a pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like it, you don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not chemically derived,
pharmaceutical as we are used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you will need COVA,
this is why you will need laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, you will need a lot of things just
in order to ship it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product integrity along the distribution
chain eliminate temperature excursions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, at the end of the
logistic chain, there is a QP.
[SPEAKER_00]: QP is a qualified person that have to
release the product into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys, I don't know if you know,
but the QP in Europe get the most high
[SPEAKER_00]: salary in the industry because these guys
have criminal responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they clear a product to the market,
they have criminal responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will never clear it until they will
see the whole tests and the data logger
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything is correct, otherwise they
will not clear it to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of regulations are counter-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full temperature control processes,
thermal covers, specially qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: packages, data loggers, exactly as the
pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ship it without it, you cannot
clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a data logger,
if you don't have the temperature records,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody in Europe will clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will approve the release to the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, and the last thing was make sure
that you understand your customer
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptance or rejection criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not on the country level,
but it's your customer that will tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this and this test or I needed this
laboratory report or whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they have an acceptance
procedure and you don't follow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will not approve the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when, when it arrives to their
facility, then it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you know your customer
criteria to reject or to accept your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the country level,
it's also your customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a schematic chart,
how we ship cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect it with a temperature control
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring it to the airport, to a
temperature control chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it to the aircraft in a
temperature control environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly in, I mean take off, then land on the
other side, same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in a chamber, in a temperature
control chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a temperature control truck to deliver
it and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not maintaining the logistic
chain as it shows here, probably you will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a temperature excursion and the
product cannot be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many issues around that,
like stability data, like all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements, but at the end of the day,
if your process, your logistic process is
[SPEAKER_00]: not qualified, and it's not, and all by
the way, all the logistic partners that
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be qualified, the trucking company,
the customer broker, the airline or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you are using, then this will not
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it not happen, products will not be
released to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security and loss prevention, I already
spoke about that, to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that you have to protect the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can protect it in many, many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging, anti-tampering kinds of
packaging, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secure transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, some countries will give
specific license to the trucking company,
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise they cannot carry cannabis,
and it has to be sealed and it has to have
[SPEAKER_00]: GPS and it has to have a lot of issues
when you carry cannabis even in a van or
[SPEAKER_00]: in a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then tampering avoidance, I spoke about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online trackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many types of, we call it data
loggers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about temperature trackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many types of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation is to put one data
logger for each pilot or for each package
[SPEAKER_00]: that they ship two of them has to be
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The online data loggers will give you two
advantages that you don't have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it will give you the location,
you will know where it is because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: GPS system, so you know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if there is a delay or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing which is more
important is you know if there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the loggers will give you an alert
before the excursion, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 15 to 25 and all the cannabis
products are being shipped between 15 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 Celsius degrees, so I don't need the
alert when it's 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the alert when it's 24,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to avoid it, you can get
alerts from these online data loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my recommendation and they are
available in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other data loggers, a lot of people
will call it USB data loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them postmortem data loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why postmortem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you read it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my son says, what was was was was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing you can do about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the temperature excursion,
but you can do anything with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use an online data loggers,
you can eliminate the excursion even
[SPEAKER_00]: before it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing is something that we
provide as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very unique insurance coverage for
the whole transportation door to door
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that receiving or getting
insurance for cannabis, it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic, but we have a very unique
insurance policy that covers all risks for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know that the cannabis export
starts from the import side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have to issue an import license
on the destination country, and then based
[SPEAKER_00]: on that, you have to issue an export
permit on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how narcotics in general is
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each side will take different time and
will require different information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without the export permit and the
import permit, there's no way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, none of the airlines will
carry cannabis shipments unless you have
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a prerequisite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The airlines will check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, not all the airlines are
carrying cannabis, just few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they do, they will ask for your
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot avoid this process,
and it takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's sweat, not just the time,
but it is a very important process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing you have to really
understand is that the information on the
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses has to be identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the export license is not exactly as
the import license, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before, in our company, we have a
procedure that even before we pick up a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf or a flower or whatever, we take the
documents, we send them to the other side,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in Germany or in any other country,
they check it, they approve it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just then we will collect the freight
or the cargo or the shipments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we ship it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ship unless you make sure that you
can clear it on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's not going to work,
you lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about the physical
logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we spoke about the
documents, we spoke about the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand that in cannabis
shipments, few agencies will be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, it will be the DEA,
customs, minister of health, minister of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, FDA, a lot of agencies,
and you have to adhere to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every cannabis shipment,
almost every cannabis shipment will go
[SPEAKER_00]: through physical check, either in the
exportation side or the importation side,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it will take time and it may
even cost more money because of storage
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every shipment will be physically
examined.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some countries, like Australia,
it will need quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will need to quarantine the shipment
for a few days before you can clear it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those aspects have to be considered
before you ship out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, GDP regulations, and there's
something that you have to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a strict requirement that you
control all your supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not good enough that you ship it
out and you export it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to control the whole way until it
will arrive to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way your regulators want to
see how you control your logistics chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a nice to have, it's a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about online
traceability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few words about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we need to talk about definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we recognize six, I would say,
types of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is a medical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are two products in the
world, that's it, the Pedilex and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only finished product that were
approved by FDA, and they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered as medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the food and drinks,
you know, all the adiabats that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the food additives,
vitamins, novel food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Novel food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is from the UK here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Novel food, come on, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so each country, even within
Europe, well, UK is not Europe anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, each country is taking a
different definition for CBD food
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be vitamins, some will be
additives, whatever, just to show you,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the map from before, how we can
manage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have veterinary products,
very good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dog that's barking too much,
CBD products, put into sleep perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, there are many products like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Creams, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of products in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not each country will accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing is smokable products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are cigarettes,
CBD cigarettes as well, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: funny, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to get high, but they're still
smoking CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important here is the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I said be careful with claims with
CBD products, especially if you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, if you're claiming that your
product is, I don't know, anti-aging or
[SPEAKER_00]: curing something or whatever, FDA will run
after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot claim any scientific benefit
or, I don't know, therapeutic benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: your CBD product, and the reason is
there's no proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments doesn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the bottom, you can see again,
Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different countries, different level of
THC, different regulatory requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet again, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in CBD, which is not narcotics,
there's still things that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a little bit another
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the map is not important because
tomorrow it will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's almost my last slide about do
and don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is about licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Import expert regulation and basic
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have customers, sellers or buyers,
you have to make sure that they understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found ourselves sometimes teaching,
again, sorry for the example in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching Canadian companies which are
great growers of cannabis how to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exporters in Canada because they never had
the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very big local market,
never exported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seller certification, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some countries, EUGMP is a requirement,
CUMCS, GACP, IQC, all kinds of letters
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm not sure that everybody
understand them, but it's a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seller certification, it's
according to the buyer regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't have EUGMP, you cannot
import it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, a lot of people you will
meet will tell you, yeah, we have EUGMP,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in the process, we have an audit in
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't show on the Eurodora
website, it's not EUGMP, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So stories we know, but facts,
this is what should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Import export, permit, I spoke about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, again, laboratory test,
C of A's, a lot of requirements around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be risk based.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do a risk analysis and risk
mitigation for each of your lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are importing from Uruguay or
from Canada or your ship to Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: every lane has to be analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to analyze the risk and make sure
that you mitigate it, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: No stories about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature excursion or an unmanaged
process can actually bring into a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that your project will be
rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security along the whole journey,
dedicated insurance coverage, packages,
[SPEAKER_00]: labels, temperature loggers, everything
has to be precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The requirements for labels in Israel are
not the same as the requirements of labels
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the labels on the bag or on the box
are not according to the country specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if you come to us,
we will ask to see pictures of the labels
[SPEAKER_00]: even before we pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the labels are not correct,
forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing, labels has to be
printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadians, don't write it down in your
handwriting, print it, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Import practical procedure, I said before,
it's not always the formal version,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you from our experience that we
had the shipment from Canada and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian guys didn't pack the bags
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We delivered the shipment to the airline
Saturday evening, it was shipment to
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday evening we delivered it to the
airline and there was a lot of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the airline said, we're not going to
carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're afraid that the passengers and the
pilots will get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, really, real story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to take it back, by the way,
I don't know if you know, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-smell bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to put bags all around the
shipment and then we send it back,
[SPEAKER_00]: real story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, when you're putting stuff in
bags, make sure that you heat seal it and
[SPEAKER_00]: not staple it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat seal, by the way, twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're doing zip lock, heat seal
the bottom and then the zip lock and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you're doing the right
thing in order to make sure that it
[SPEAKER_00]: arrives safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan your flights carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever shipped to Israel, we have a very
weird procedure in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clear cannabis products,
just on Tuesdays between 10 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you come on Tuesday evening,
you have to wait a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ask me why.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is in advance we pick it up
on Fridays, we fly it in on Saturday,
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sunday, make sure that we have it on
Monday and then we clear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another point, don't ever never ever ever
ever land on U.S.
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Never ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't know that the airline,
even very sophisticated non-airline like
[SPEAKER_00]: the German airlines without names,
will land in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: without even that you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be confiscated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you are not landing even
not by mistake on U.S.
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan your flights carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just in order of timing but also in
the route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said before, don't ever ship
unless you make sure that you can clear it
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ship if you cannot clear it on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm open to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
