[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna be talking about
regulations today.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're familiar with Vancouver,
you'll know that it's a bit of a,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a word I can't use on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bit of a mess in terms of
regulations, and it's a good thing we've
[SPEAKER_05]: got John here to help us go over that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So John, I'm gonna kick it off by asking
you, what is the legislative framework and
[SPEAKER_05]: role of the provinces, local governments,
and other bodies such as the BC
[SPEAKER_05]: Agricultural Land Commission since
legalization in October 2018?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have 23 different countries
here, so we thought it would be useful to
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of give you the different framework
that exists in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after listening to Laurie,
I'm reminded of the family motto,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is history cannot be denied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we obviously have history repeating
itself, just as what happened with
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol, the bottom line being local
governments are the problem that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to overcome in order to get the market to
really take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, in Canada, criminal law is a
federal power unlike the US, and so that
[SPEAKER_02]: explains a bit of a difference why you've
got all your states now making it legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically, you had all your states
making it illegal before your federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government, and now it's unwinding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the criminal law power is federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've done here is we have
legalized a little bit, we have
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalized a little bit with the
ticketing scheme that kicks in after the
[SPEAKER_02]: legal part, and we have kept in an awful
lot of criminal law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Cannabis Act and the cannabis
regulations are still criminal law.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government says it's still
using the criminal law, and it has allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: the provinces to be involved in
distribution so production, various rules
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with promotion and advertising and
all of that, as was mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: taken from the tobacco industry,
is controlled federally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The province now controls distribution,
and so that's the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you may know from a certain case
where a lady allowed the people to come to
[SPEAKER_02]: a garden party, the police saw three
plants in public view.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in Revelstoke, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you've got local government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so not only towns, cities,
municipalities, of course, zoning,
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing, all of these sorts of things,
but also we have the Agricultural Land
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission, for example, which is a
provincial body that recently said we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to be involved in applications
for people wanting to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a designated farm use if you're in an
agricultural area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to pass to the local
governments the power to decide various
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about whether you can do what
you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now you can only grow in soil,
for example, since last July.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a building in the
Agricultural Land Reserve already,
[SPEAKER_02]: fine, you can produce inside that
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't, you can only do it in
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so greenhouses are going to be the way
that people will be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you'll have a place like Richmond,
BC, where the airport is, which will say,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're very jealous about our industrial
uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't do it in an industrial area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do it in an agricultural area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have all of these conflicting
positions being taken by either different
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies or local governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to do whatever you want to do in the
cannabis scene, you're going to have to,
[SPEAKER_02]: A, give notice to local governments and
get their permission or approval or
[SPEAKER_02]: support.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just like in the old alcohol days,
we have wet areas and we have dry areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to take some time in order
to get them to move along.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Abbotsford, where I live in Mission,
it's like a wait and see, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: we've had people involved in the industry
and around the area for an awful long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the basic framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could obviously get into it in a lot
more detail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for explaining that,
John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Given all of that, I imagine, and I know
for a fact, British Columbia, Vancouver in
[SPEAKER_05]: particular, has been a pretty important
place when it comes to recognizing medical
[SPEAKER_05]: need for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my next question is for Dory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dory, in what ways has legalization
impacted your medical customers?
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be on already, I think,
at the dispensary you manage downtown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the customers are being largely
ignored by the government program while
[SPEAKER_03]: they take this wait and see attitude and
they'll review it in a few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because so many stores have been closed
down in such quick ways without any
[SPEAKER_03]: contingency plans whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting to meet a lot more sick
people while they wait in line for their
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, which is a problem for sick
people because one of the reasons we
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted so many dispensaries open was so
that people would be able to get quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: served and have time with their dispenser.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's being taken away from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are being told that they can just get
their needs met at a legal store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, if we asked Andrew what's allowed
on his shelf today compared to what was
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed or what he had on his shelves
before, it would be largely different and
[SPEAKER_03]: people's needs aren't being met.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not able to get the lotion and
creams in the manner that they got them
[SPEAKER_03]: before and the prices are not affordable
for the kind of people that I serve in my
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew's not allowed to have a dispensary,
so don't call it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cannabis retail outlet,
though dispensing goes on behind those
[SPEAKER_03]: doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not allowed to be called that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no compassion allowed to be...
Though they have it in their hearts,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not allowed to serve it in their
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the part that people are
fearing for right now is who's gonna take
[SPEAKER_03]: care of them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they gonna be able to go and get
the cookies and the lotion and the little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of love that they're looking for every
day because it's not just about weaning on
[SPEAKER_03]: the shelves, it's about love and caring
that also happens with these people while
[SPEAKER_03]: they're getting their medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Dori, 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Andrew, pardon me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Andrew, you're on the other side of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to know, yeah, having gone
through the transition and receiving your
[SPEAKER_05]: license to operate in Vancouver,
what are some of the opportunities you see
[SPEAKER_05]: for Kiaro and other legal retailers in
British Columbia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to everyone this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opportunity abounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really at the ground level here and
we can really go up from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching the numbers at all,
British Columbia with $19 million in sales
[SPEAKER_00]: since legalization is a figure that should
really draw a lot of attention to really
[SPEAKER_00]: the issue at hand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dori speaks to a well-established and
entrenched medical market here that has
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations and needs and the current
regime isn't serving those needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a period of transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to acknowledge that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes patience and perseverance and
sacrifice to move through this
[SPEAKER_00]: transitionary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about it as myself as a medical
patient and the situation people are put
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have PTSD and I recall just serving so
many people that had conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses where this was their only
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my heart goes out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am encouraged every day though by the
amazing people, not only in this room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in our community and around the world
that are pushing hard for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We owe it to them to get this right and
I'm incredibly encouraged by the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have done it before and we will do it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking about this question,
Amanda, and I brought a poem by Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: Kipling called If, and I'm just gonna read
a small segment of it because I find it
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly inspiring because this is so
poignant to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can keep your head about you,
if you can keep your head when all about
[SPEAKER_00]: you are losing theirs and blaming it on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can trust yourself when all men
doubt you, but make allowance for their
[SPEAKER_00]: doubting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can wait and not be tired of
waiting or being lied about and don't deal
[SPEAKER_00]: in lies or being hated, don't give way to
hating and yet don't look too good nor
[SPEAKER_00]: talk too wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can dream and not make dreams your
master, if you can think and not make
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts your aim, if you can meet with
triumph and disaster and treat with those
[SPEAKER_00]: two imposters just the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an important line here and
this is what really struck me to share
[SPEAKER_00]: this today is, if you can bear to hear the
truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to
[SPEAKER_00]: make traps for fools, or watch the things
you gave your life to broken and stoop
[SPEAKER_00]: down and build them up with worn out
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think about that and I think about
Dory and I think about John and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the patients in this community that
I can't have that conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore and it hurts a lot every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk to our retail staff about this
and I go, you know, we're still empowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still be inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still connect with people and
provide solutions, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Greenblatt came out with this great
line at the last lift conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about creative compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm pushing towards at
Chiaro and that's what I'm pushing towards
[SPEAKER_00]: in my work with Acres, the Association of
Canadian Cannabis Retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reuniting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're invigorating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bringing this train home again and
it's gonna take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a process and it sucks most of the
time to be frank with you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what you've built broken and have
to stoop down, to stoop after all we've
[SPEAKER_00]: built and sacrificed and proven,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is probably the most tragic part of
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm encouraging and I'm
incredibly encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna continue to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're building strong
relationships with our supply chain that
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be responsive to this need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're holding the government accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing to advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This message isn't being lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of us who have transitioned,
I know they're working hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, ostensibly, they can't
always share all the information they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, but the power of anecdote,
the power of research, the greatest victim
[SPEAKER_00]: of prohibition is now coming to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the power of this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm incredibly encouraged, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for your honesty and for
that poem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I might need a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my next question is for John.
[SPEAKER_05]: John, can you tell us about a specific
appeal in Vancouver involving corona
[SPEAKER_05]: health?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people in the room might know the
name and the way that dispensary sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: fits into Vancouver bylaws.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does this intersect with the
constitutional question of reasonable
[SPEAKER_05]: access for medical patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I should have mentioned in the
opening, the federal government has kept
[SPEAKER_02]: control over medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while health constitutionally is a
divided field between the feds and the
[SPEAKER_02]: provinces, they've kept control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I incorporated the BC Compassion Club
Society.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 1997, so more than 20 years ago,
they had rave reviews from all of the task
[SPEAKER_02]: forces and everybody that's ever looked
into it and holding it up as a good model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the federal
government came along and didn't provide
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical dispensaries in the Cannabis
Act or regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is going to be another court
case that seeks to declare that genuine
[SPEAKER_02]: medical dispensaries, compassion clubs are
part of reasonable access.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should understand that here in Canada,
the constitution provides in section seven
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have the right to life,
liberty, and the security of your person,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the right not to be deprived thereof,
except in accordance with something called
[SPEAKER_02]: the principles of fundamental justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the court first, way, way back in
2001, the Ontario Court of Appeal,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more recently, the Federal Court Trial
Division in Allard, confirmed that the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal government has to provide medical
exemptions for medically approved patients
[SPEAKER_02]: to prevent the violation of the security
of their person, having established that
[SPEAKER_02]: what they did in the past was to do that
arbitrarily, which is contrary to
[SPEAKER_02]: principles of fundamental justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So constitutional rights are involved when
it comes to medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city of Vancouver, much to its
credit, passed bylaws to enable medical
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, among others, but some of
them weren't able to meet the rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: such as being 300 metres from the nearest
school, another compassion club,
[SPEAKER_02]: or dispensary, these sorts of rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ultimately, an injunction was
brought to shut them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I credit the city of Vancouver
for, unlike Toronto, using the police
[SPEAKER_02]: right at the outset to shut everybody
down, and using the civil process here
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of the police to have the issues
resolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: in a civil manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in any event, these were the ones that
couldn't meet the requirements of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bylaws, called themselves medical
dispensaries, and interestingly,
[SPEAKER_02]: the government didn't challenge that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went to court, and we
counter-petitioned to say that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: part of reasonable access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a patient, we had a patient
running a club, we got standing,
[SPEAKER_02]: we did the full argument and everything,
and then the judge decided not to decide
[SPEAKER_02]: the constitutional question, which we're
appealing, and the appeal is set for
[SPEAKER_02]: sometime in November, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, the court ruled that the
bylaws were valid, and that these folks
[SPEAKER_02]: had to comply with the bylaws,
and that it would be unwise, is the way he
[SPEAKER_02]: put it, to decide the constitutional
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a better way to handle that
issue, and that's going to be another
[SPEAKER_02]: application in the Federal Court Trial
Division to seek that type of a
[SPEAKER_02]: declaration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably heard something similar is
going to occur with respect to these
[SPEAKER_02]: limitations in terms of 10 milligrams in
the edibles and the extracts and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know that medical patients in
Canada, since the Smith case, Kirk
[SPEAKER_02]: Toussaint is here somewhere, was the main
counsel, established that medical patients
[SPEAKER_02]: are entitled to possess cannabis in any of
its forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not limited to dried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have to make it themselves,
and so again, many of them have been
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for these dispensaries to be able
to provide them with high-end extracts and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on that they require for their medical
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the government, in its
short-sightedness, is worried about novice
[SPEAKER_02]: users consuming too much or accidentally
taking too much, as opposed to giving
[SPEAKER_02]: priority to prevent the violation of the
constitutional rights of medical patients
[SPEAKER_02]: to ensure that they get what they need in
order to, in some cases, survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, the Karuna appeal is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not optimistic that the Court of
Appeal is necessarily going to grab the
[SPEAKER_02]: issue, so we're probably going to have to
relitigate it in Federal Court along with
[SPEAKER_02]: the extracts issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really nice way to segue into my
next question for Dory.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of you in the audience may know
that on October 17th of this year,
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations in Canada are going to change
so that we can have edibles, extracts,
[SPEAKER_05]: and topicals brought into the mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dory, given those new regulations,
how do you foresee the regulations on the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational market, pardon me,
impacting medical users and consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: overall?
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you're unwrapping some goodies over
there for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I understand that everybody's use of
cannabis is different, and everybody has
[SPEAKER_03]: different needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also understand that we all learn in a
different way, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wanted to do something that was
just a little bit visual to help you
[SPEAKER_03]: understand this concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to make the case for and
against 10 milligram cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have all of our cookies have to
be 10 milligrams, and I need 200
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams, this is how many cookies I'm
going to need to eat at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 2,300 calories in cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 130 calories each.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the room for broccoli if we're
just eating cookies like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the issues that I see are all this
excess packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already know that that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see obesity, diabetes, and a host of
other medical problems that go along with
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting people to eat all this sugar,
chocolate, flour, all the other
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients that go along with this to get
somebody up to a 200 milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said I would make a for and against.
[SPEAKER_03]: If all of our cookies were 200 milligrams,
and we have the light weights,
[SPEAKER_03]: we would need to be serving pieces of
cookie this big.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one cookie cut up into 20 pieces
this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: This can be satisfying for somebody that's
on a diet and only needs the 10
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams, but it's just not a reasonable
way to have people pack their cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's okay to have a 10 milligram
cookie, clearly labeled, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: okay to have a 200 milligram cookie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly labeled, just like a 500 milligram
cookie, clearly labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that before October 17th comes
along that people start to really
[SPEAKER_03]: contemplate what this 10 milligram dosage
is gonna cause because this isn't just a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a recreational problem as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people, five milligrams, they only
need this and they're gonna be high all
[SPEAKER_03]: day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people would need to eat five times
that in a day to even start to feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's not cause another health problem
while we're trying to save people from
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dory, for that show and tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: My next question is for Andrew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, consumers in Vancouver,
we're pretty spoiled.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're used to being able to access a wide
variety of strains of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can regulated retailers compete
against the entrenched market in
[SPEAKER_05]: Vancouver?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great and important
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short answer is we can't, flat out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have better quality, better variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a consumer base that knows who
they are and are habituated in that
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to compete against the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a natural progression that'll
happen over time when you start looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the established markets in the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes five, seven years to start to
see that erosion and it has to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: through transition and it has to happen
through integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I try and focus on as a
retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that market in our market providing
products and building solutions and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with the dialogue and moving the
needle on key social issues because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been doing it the longest and if
we don't get that intellectual talent and
[SPEAKER_00]: that human capital into the cannabis pool
in the regulated environment, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a pretty insipid pool and it's
not gonna be meeting the needs of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't try and compete against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and integrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve as a director of acres and we
really work to advocate and lobby
[SPEAKER_00]: government on important issues to help
integrate the legacy market into the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a vital mission that over the
next three to five years is gonna take a
[SPEAKER_00]: concerted effort of all of us in this room
and all of us in this country and
[SPEAKER_00]: community to really push for because these
people help build the opportunity we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're not responsive to that,
A, just because we need the talent and B,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's really owed through this
process of legalization to help get people
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as someone who has transitioned
successfully, I wanna use that open door
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring others with me and to really
build positive and purposeful momentum
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are larger existential threats in
our industry and I would say, and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: the government is working hard and I have
empathy for regulators, but the BCLDB is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually more on my radar for competition
than the illicit market is, to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a cap on the number of
stores that they can have in British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can pay their frontline staff $30 an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do revenue sharing with
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are distinctive advantages that if
you're a community that's sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fence about cannabis, I mean, that's a
much safer, more extensively stable option
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that starting to happen
in communities across the GVRD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I'm focused on those things and
on the regulations themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I try and compliment Minister
Farnworth when I see him about the
[SPEAKER_00]: progression we're seeing with the LCRB and
applications are starting to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 63 licensed, we got 68 in AIP,
we got 300 or more under community review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are encouraging numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're way behind, but we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But window opacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is for me, like almost issue
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at destigmatizing and
naturalizing and integrating cannabis into
[SPEAKER_00]: the social context in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having opaque windows is not achieving
that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I look at, you know,
operators, you know, Jeff at Muse,
[SPEAKER_00]: people were walking by, didn't even know
he was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tragic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the amount of investment
and infrastructure and training that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into building a regulated retail store in
Canada, it's a tremendously daunting
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, again, for me, I'm looking
at the BCLDB actually more than I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It factors in, obviously, when you look
at, you know, online, there's a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: big market there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we operate in two
provinces, in Saskatchewan, we have shops
[SPEAKER_00]: in Saskatoon and in the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And online sales there are pretty dismal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the kind of, you know,
word on the street with most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: operators, because again, everyone's
getting what they need online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting the topicals, they're
getting the edibles, things they really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really want and need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about phase two products
coming in, because that's going to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: big shift and create a big opportunity for
the regulated retailers to help meet some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that market need and help that market
transition over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm concerned that it's going to be
the same dynamic out the gate that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: with flour and oil, where it's not going
to be great out the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of challenges and
uncertainty on the supply chain in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep pushing, keep
advocating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to keep our stakeholders
engaged and educated on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we really work at Chiaro
to keep that conversation moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: in a positive, purposeful direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want to whine and
complain aimlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have to focus on what our needs
are, what our goals are, work to build a
[SPEAKER_00]: community and consensus and cohesion
around those, and go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made legalization happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm incredibly proud of that, being a part
of that movement and that momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not getting their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a huge entrenched market
that's not transitioning because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see the opportunity yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we've got to advocate for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep, you know, pushing the needle on
making sure we're reducing those barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: to entry, creating more viable,
sustainable business opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to see in front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, looking at the regulated
environment right now, that's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, we've just got to stay positive
and purposeful, keep pushing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and offer that personalized service to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they'll keep coming back if they
start getting some rapport and
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we're focused on really training
our staff incredibly well to build strong
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships at the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to build the rapport and
the referrals we need to weather the storm
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate that point you made
about competing with the LDB.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, John, another question for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We touched a little bit on creative
compliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if the BC Cannabis Control and
Licensing Act doesn't apply to medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, but the definition of a cannabis
store in the Vancouver bylaw includes a
[SPEAKER_05]: compassion club, what should the
compassion club and medical dispensaries
[SPEAKER_05]: do in Vancouver to prevent being shut
down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as I think was mentioned earlier,
the government here clearly was hoping
[SPEAKER_02]: that medical would disappear and go into
the rec stores and there wouldn't be any
[SPEAKER_02]: medical dispensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensaries, that's clearly what they
intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: The City of Vancouver, again, in putting
its bylaw together, created a category
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a compassion club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, while some of the dispensaries
have, I think, what was it, a $30,000 fee,
[SPEAKER_02]: the compassion club's only a $1,000 fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have a wellness centre that
goes with it and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, Vancouver was foresight,
had foresight in terms of the plan and
[SPEAKER_02]: what everybody expected the feds would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, and provide for medical
dispensaries or compassion clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the community safety team is the group
that is now from various police agencies
[SPEAKER_02]: going around the province trying to close
people down if you don't have an
[SPEAKER_02]: application going through the provincial
system for a rec license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were telling the compassion club
and others that's what they should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got your application in,
it's my understanding they'll leave you
[SPEAKER_02]: alone as it's going through the province.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, bearing in mind that medical is still
controlled by the feds, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses under the Cannabis Act is,
you know, you've got a license to produce,
[SPEAKER_02]: a license to process, a nursery license
and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is a license for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a subclass license that's to
sell for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, my position has been, and I've taken
this up with the community safety team,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the compassion clubs and true medical
dispensaries are not recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Provincial Act expressly says so,
that it doesn't apply to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm having them apply for a license to
sell for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm saying as long as they're in the
process applying for their license to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical purposes, which they've been
doing for the last 20 plus years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should also be leaving them alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, if you do go in there and
try to shut them down, remember you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be interfering with the
constitutional rights of medically
[SPEAKER_02]: approved patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will have a remedy for the
violation of their constitutional rights
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, be aware that you're dealing with a
different type of entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, again, the Vancouver bylaw expressly
has a definition of a cannabis store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, in the Karuna case,
they were trying to say that their prior
[SPEAKER_02]: definition simply allowed the compassion
club to be an advocate for medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: as opposed to actually providing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the definition of a cannabis store now
in the bylaw clearly includes a compassion
[SPEAKER_02]: club, interestingly enough, and clearly
makes it clear that you can sell cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for in the case of a compassion club for
medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to get that federal license
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we do have a good argument,
I think, here in Vancouver to try and get
[SPEAKER_02]: the federal license in order to get the
city license as a cannabis store,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as a compassion club.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that hopefully we'll see that develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if they turn us down, we will be
looking at the courts in order to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: remedy the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's always encouraging to hear again
from Laurie Ajax what she said about
[SPEAKER_02]: California, and I've heard this from
others, how they do prioritize the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: in the stores and are able to run them
both together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, unfortunately, they've just left it
as rec and they haven't made any provision
[SPEAKER_02]: for the medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will continue to battle away in
order to get this sorted out one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank goodness for John, ever diligent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got one last question for Andrew,
and then we're gonna open it up to
[SPEAKER_05]: questions from the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you started to touch on this a
little bit at the end of your last answer,
[SPEAKER_05]: but being a retailer in this new market,
what are some ways that retailers can add
[SPEAKER_05]: value beyond the transaction, especially
with such tight regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they are definitely tight and
daunting out the gate right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to get a message that
connects with consumers out there because
[SPEAKER_00]: you really can't connect with consumers,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this idea of creative
compliance comes to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not gonna play the passive role in
this and just kind of accept the fate
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna create opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Cairo, we've been focused on really
building a strong relationship with our
[SPEAKER_00]: supply partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a firm believer that our
first row of customers is our suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we built an educational alignment
program that's invested on four key
[SPEAKER_00]: pillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the customer education and
customer experience first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start there, if you empower people,
you inspire them, they become not just
[SPEAKER_00]: your customers, they become your
advocates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can go out there and do that work
for you in terms of galvanizing regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: and voting with their wallets and
hopefully voting for changes in provincial
[SPEAKER_00]: and federal regimes that are opposed to
what they're trying to pursue and their
[SPEAKER_00]: vision and values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that educational component in the
store extends to really, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: building that relationship with the supply
chain again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many patients in the legacy market were
so connected to some of the suppliers and
[SPEAKER_00]: those stories and the people and purpose
and passion that helped build those
[SPEAKER_00]: products and created viable solutions that
actually save people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going back and really digging
deep on our supply chain and really
[SPEAKER_00]: creating that intimacy of exchange and
learning about the people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes and the paths and the passion
behind each of the products that are on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't try and be a convenience store
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not there to just puke products on
people because that's the aim,
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really have a curated assortment that
really speaks to the needs data of a
[SPEAKER_00]: well-defined customer demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we really look to build that
narrative with the customer in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining how these products are
manufactured and processed and the care
[SPEAKER_00]: and intent that goes into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the great privilege of going on
tours of some of these million-dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tremendously encouraging to see
the energy and the vibe in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to translate that into the
retail experience again, talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: good work these companies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a chance to go out and visit our
friends at Seven Acres in Kincardin,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an amazing vibe with their
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really cultivate excellent craft
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a vision and a purpose that,
again, translates well in the retail
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have great products as well,
great profile, nerfy nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good stuff a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the time, despite a lot of the
challenges with packaging and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff that we're all upset about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second pillar of that, which is
equally important, is community investment
[SPEAKER_00]: and involvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really look to get out in the
community, be proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I mentioned, I serve as a
director of Acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there advocating, lobbying,
working with regulators and decision
[SPEAKER_00]: makers at all levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't stay passive in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: As elections come and people change,
there's a lot of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at that crescendo point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversation's still a year in.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to learn about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stigma is abating itself slowly in the
eyes of a lot of municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to learn about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to hear about the value of the
regulated environment and how that can
[SPEAKER_00]: help improve public health and safety and
address the concerns around the illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: market by providing a path for transition
and really protect the interests of young
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are messages and metrics that we can
actually deliver as a regulated retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third pillar that we really
position ourselves around in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: creating value beyond the transaction is
staff education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, your frontline staff right now,
if you're a retailer, that is your
[SPEAKER_00]: lifeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will live or die by the relationships
they create at the counter because the
[SPEAKER_00]: product quality, not in all cases,
but in most of them, isn't there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't like the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting ID'd at the front sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're 68 years old coming in and getting
ID'd and you forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely ridiculous sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to take the care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take the consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta build that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're earning relationships all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're literally starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have that humble,
stay hungry attitude in this business
[SPEAKER_00]: because you cannot rest on your laurels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really expect nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to build it all yourself and you
have to do it with the community around
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stay well integrated with all of my
retailer partners as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out to all their grand openings,
spend a ton in their shops if I can that
[SPEAKER_00]: first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went out to the City Cannabis Grand
Opening on Cambion 8th, spent 200 bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: just watching that stuff fly up and down
that tube if you've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking about my peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there and engaged in a positive
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have time to be covetous and
competitive right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to build confidence in the market
again and we did that pre-legalization by
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking together as a community and we're
gonna do that again and we focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: training our staff to be able to deliver
those messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out and be active and informed about
what's going on in the environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: really the lifestyle integration component
as well for a lot of consumers who are new
[SPEAKER_00]: to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I transport this according to the
legal framework?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I store this at home safely as a
parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have those conversations with our
customers at Chiaro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, and this is probably the
most important pillar of it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: is data and information exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're learning again,
this whole process over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the phase two products coming in,
it's gonna be a whole galaxy of new
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for the challenge,
of course, because I know it's gonna meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the need of a lot more consumers and give
us an opportunity to buoy our businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: again and get some more revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, we're really
vested in continuing the conversations and
[SPEAKER_00]: building understanding with our supply
chain, with our local stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_00]: with our MLAs, with our MPs, with our
other fellow operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, everyone in the community
that's contributed so far, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to come and have a quality exchange
at Chiaro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're incredibly excited to keep
stewarding that in a positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: purposeful way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very well said, all three of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to open it up to questions from
the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have about five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it one more time for the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bueller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bueller, apparently they were so
informative that you don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very comprehensive, would be the
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Closer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm from California, and if I
understood correctly, you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys are limited to 10 milligram doses
per product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as medicinally?
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposed regulations are that you
won't be able to have more than 10
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams of THC in an edible,
in a discrete unit, so you could have a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram unit or two fives for,
say, an edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the extract, you could have capsules
in a container, again, but it can't exceed
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a topical, it's up to a gram,
with no package size on the topical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say recreationally,
that's what the proposed limit's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicinally, we don't have a limit on our
doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go to the doctor and arrange with
them the daily amount that we need,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that we can get a recommendation for
that and have a medical license that
[SPEAKER_03]: allows us to use more than what a
recreational person would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because there are no mechanisms for
medicinal patients to get their medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: other than this, what they're proposing in
the new recreational stores, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, medical people, just go line up at
a recreational store, and all your needs
[SPEAKER_03]: will be met there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is not the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we make our own cookies at home,
we can do what we want to with,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as the dose level goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we need to have somebody else make
a cookie for us, a lot of my customers
[SPEAKER_03]: that come through are people that don't
have a fridge and stove or a mixing bowl
[SPEAKER_03]: to make a brownie in, and they rely on us
to have the clean kitchen and the
[SPEAKER_03]: standardized dose ready for them at a
reasonable price for them to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: consume on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes they don't even have a
cupboard that they can keep a dozen
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies in for, so they have to be able to
come and make a daily purchase,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they can't afford to buy this many
cookies if that was what they were
[SPEAKER_03]: relegated to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and so I'm very passionate about
the medicinal side of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I'm curious, as retail operations,
how are you guys getting innovative and
[SPEAKER_06]: providing solutions, or do you just have
no solutions to offer medicinal patients
[SPEAKER_06]: that come into your stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the power of anecdote,
when you are so limited in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking to the efficacy of cannabis is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing that personal testimony as much as
you can in a credible and genuine way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're really focused on
encouraging that as much as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: within the framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the research is out there,
and you can point people to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in a regulated retail environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the greatest victim of prohibition
was the research, and now that's coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: light all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's undeniable, the proof, and you can
point people in that direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can empower them to look at those
resources, make up their own mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: make an informed decision, and come back
and choose a solution offering that's best
[SPEAKER_00]: aligned with that, with what's available
in the retail environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can, through events and
engagement outside of the designated
[SPEAKER_00]: four-wall retail environment, work and
partner with people who are educators on a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole host of different fronts,
whether it's medical, therapeutic,
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can participate and sponsor and be a
part of events like that to help push that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation forward, to keep that portion
of the community, and there's a large
[SPEAKER_00]: number of them, and even us as
recreational consumers over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: our lives will be impacted by injury,
illness, and stress, and we'll have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in different ways as we're
encumbered by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the power of testimony and
anecdote, really pointing people towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the research, and then helping to support
educators that are out there talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in more than just a recreational
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do to help empower
consumers when we're so limited right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Sherry Bennett.
[SPEAKER_04]: I own a company called Let's Talk
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work on the front lines with people with
pain, severe arthritis, seizures,
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of my clients are seniors who are
getting their cannabis from their
[SPEAKER_04]: grandchildren, and they would like to get
it legally, and they're having a
[SPEAKER_04]: constellation of obstacles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether one takes cannabis recreationally
or for medicinal reasons, our bodies don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is medicine, and I want to know
that, I want to understand what would it
[SPEAKER_04]: take to change the law?
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't the courts going to be just clogged
They must be already right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: because many of us, when we understand
that every human being has an
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system, and that many
diseases are a result of a deficiency of
[SPEAKER_04]: the endocannabinoid system, this is a
topic that affects every human being,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, question is like, what do we have
to do to change the law, to change the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we have to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many more years will it take,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wouldn't say the courts are
clogged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, I used to get people calling me
every day with being busted for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was called to the bar in 1972,
and it went from a few hundred people
[SPEAKER_02]: being busted a year to 10,000,
mostly for simple possessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very few people who've been
charged under the Cannabis Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you're talking about is these
constitutional challenges, and they do
[SPEAKER_02]: take a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the National Academy of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine surveying all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the studies to do with cannabis throughout
the world a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: and concluded that notwithstanding the
difficulties in doing the research,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is conclusive evidence that cannabis
is effective for chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the people dying on the streets
from today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Being prescribed Doxycontin, and other
types of opiates, becoming addicted,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then going to the street when their
doctors cut them off, and getting a dose
[SPEAKER_02]: of fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that cannabis, we now have
double-blind placebo-based gold standard
[SPEAKER_02]: studies that show that cannabis is one of
the best exit strategy drugs to get people
[SPEAKER_02]: off opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would think with the evidence that's
available that the governments would be
[SPEAKER_02]: running to do something, we may have to go
to court in order to compel them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it once again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
Thank you.
