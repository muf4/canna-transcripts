[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you ICBC for having us here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Kai Friedrich Niemann.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lawyer here in Germany since 2003,
working in the cannabis space since 2017,
[SPEAKER_03]: consulting hemp companies, medical
cannabis import companies, CBD companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm the legal advisor of the European
Industrial Hemp Association, which
[SPEAKER_03]: submitted these novel food applications
for authorizing CBD oils as novel food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I welcome our fellow panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to my left, Dr. Philipp Goebel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philipp is managing director of Demekan,
a German pharmaceutical company
[SPEAKER_03]: specializing in the production and
distribution of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: With his expertise in the field of pharma,
he's now actively involved in shaping the
[SPEAKER_03]: future of the German cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zita Schubert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zita serves as the general secretary of
the European Medical Cannabis Association,
[SPEAKER_03]: OMCA, and is a prominent lawyer in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her legal knowledge and experience in the
pharma industry provide valuable insights
[SPEAKER_03]: into the regulatory landscape and
international aspects of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel Heyman, lawyer from MME Legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel Heyman is a lawyer at MME Legal,
specializing in regulatory and compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: issues related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: With his expertise, he assists companies
in navigating the legal complexities of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry and advises on
strategic business decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we welcome Bob Houben from the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a renowned figure in the cannabis
industry, serving as the co-chair of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Industry Group and member in
charge of the Clark Hill Denver office.
[SPEAKER_03]: With his extensive experience in cannabis
law, he provides valuable insights into
[SPEAKER_03]: the global cannabis market and its legal
landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was done by Chad GPT, so it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what we can eat up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we heard a lot of the latest
developments in Germany today,
[SPEAKER_03]: Pillar 1, Pillar 2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't reiterate on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will give you a quick overview of the
history of cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the latest reform we had was in 1996,
[SPEAKER_03]: where farmers were allowed again to
cultivate hemp on their fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before 1996, even that was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the big reform from 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they forget were the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they said the seed, trading of seeds is
not allowed if it is for an unlawful
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only farmers allowed to sell seeds,
rather than the Netherlands and the Czech
[SPEAKER_03]: Republic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They allowed to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first big disadvantage in
1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was one provision in the new law
called the misuse of intoxication has to
[SPEAKER_03]: be ruled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this provision caused a lot of trouble
still right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was a long time, there was
nothing from 1996 till 1970, 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2014, the first patients were granted
their exemption for using cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started with 1,000 patients about that
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was this lawsuit of this patient
who applied or who wanted to grow his own
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis on his balcony to provide himself
with cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He won this case, finally, in the last
instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the German government didn't like
that, that every patient can grow his
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis on his own balcony.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they set up a whole law in 2017,
the Cannabis as Medicine Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, we started with 1,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have probably 200,000, 250,000 or
50,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one knows exactly, because these
figures are not documented.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have imports last year, 25 tons of
medical cannabis were imported to Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a domestic production about 1.52
tons, all together with all these three
[SPEAKER_03]: domestic cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about total revenue in the
market of probably 300 million euros,
[SPEAKER_03]: according to the reimbursement figures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, this number is just a guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not documented how big the size of
the market really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a small market still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are one figures, but I want to
tell you also the real world here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In February, 2023, I had three court
cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the criminal offense was the trading
of CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: In February, within three weeks,
one acquittal, one sentence was eight
[SPEAKER_03]: months on probation, and the other one was
19 months without probation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the reality besides 180,000
consumers having criminal proceedings by
[SPEAKER_03]: police and then shut down by the
prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the situation we have right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philip, let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most important thing is,
of course, as we heard many times,
[SPEAKER_03]: this morning, cannabis will be removed
from the Narcotic Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a milestone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a milestone for all the CBD
traders, which are prosecuted right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBD flower traders, CBD oil traders.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a milestone for the consumers and
probably a milestone for the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philip, what do you make of this draft?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, what potential can that
be for your company?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about Demekan and
what you make of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the chances and options of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Demekan is the only German
company who won one of the three licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: back then in 2018, 2019 from the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we produce for the government right now
one ton here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also process imports, obviously,
because we are not allowed to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in Germany, which we then can
sell also to the German market,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we obviously see as a big
disadvantage, but that's how it is right
[SPEAKER_00]: now in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, what you just mentioned,
Kai, in terms of the draft, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: leaked, I think there's quite some
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have been at Mary Jane,
you have seen maybe some talks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market says, okay, it will grow in
size in terms of three to 10 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there will be huge growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, it may be a bit limited
by the number of prescriptions or doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: who are willing to prescribe, but I think
as more as we remove the stigma from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, this obviously will lead to
market growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ourselves prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of obviously a good supplier
network that we are able to have good
[SPEAKER_00]: medical flowers to be delivered to Germany
on the one hand, and obviously logistical
[SPEAKER_00]: wise also to get it distributed to the
pharmacies, because I think this will be
[SPEAKER_00]: then when the market grows, obviously,
a certain bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to that, I think you didn't mention
yet the social clubs, which are also part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first column, as they call it in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that first draft of the law we really
are eager to see what will happen there
[SPEAKER_00]: when they may start growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yet clear how exactly it will
happen, but we just can say that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough space at our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 12 hectares in total and 30,000
square meters of facility buildings where
[SPEAKER_00]: also we may enable social clubs,
obviously, to grow cannabis at very high
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is very important to say,
let's stick to the medical standards which
[SPEAKER_00]: we have in order to ensure high product
quality, because we have seen many
[SPEAKER_00]: different products, I would say,
to keep it neutral in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to stick to that quality
scheme is very important, and we are very
[SPEAKER_00]: open to support those cannabis clubs as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there will be major change with
that first column, so taking it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics law, which will definitely grow
the market in terms of medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also obviously in terms of the social
clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that the numbers of
prescription will increase just by the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that it's not a narcotic anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, maybe some of you don't know exactly
the German system, so a narcotic
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription is a serialized prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the doctors need to apply to obtain
their block of prescriptions and can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: like 100,000 because they are limited
somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are very restricted on how to
prescribe medical cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the pharmacies, the workload to
handle narcotics is also tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for ourselves as well, so we need to
do a full inventory twice a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nightmare when you really got to do
that and count every single cram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with taking it out of the
narcotics law, many hurdles which are
[SPEAKER_00]: there right now in the market will fall,
and we will be able to serve more patients
[SPEAKER_00]: adequately with good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you in direct contact with physicians
saying if that will move from the
[SPEAKER_03]: narcotic, we will be more openly
prescribed cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you understand, or is that not a topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we see that they will get more open,
so that is like first feedback we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think obviously then at the same
time, you may have seen that on Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany passed a law that the
reimbursement of cannabis products will
[SPEAKER_00]: also be easing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think these two factors in
combination will lead that the market will
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and will open new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't give a more exact estimation
on what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently we don't have more exact
estimations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I mean estimates are between
factor three to ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's education about educating doctors as
well, but it will definitely lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zita, tell us a bit about OMCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing with this organization,
and what do you make of these new
[SPEAKER_03]: developments in Germany in terms of
medical and social clubs?
[SPEAKER_01]: First I want to thank you for the
invitation to be here, and I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: delighted to speak in front of all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OMCA is not a standard industrial
organization, but we are a kind of one
[SPEAKER_01]: voice approach, which means from the
pharmaceutical industry, of doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: association, but more important,
patient organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Kai mentioned it so nicely
that at the end, the reason why you all
[SPEAKER_01]: are sitting here is based on the Supreme
Court decision which one patient fought
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Gosha and Fleta mentioned before,
this happened in all the other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much you're engaged in
this kind of field, but I think this is
[SPEAKER_01]: worthwhile consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one is I would just like to
respond to this narcotic situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think this is a very big
question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The route to reimbursement is a
prescription, and the route for a product
[SPEAKER_01]: is to be in a status of a prescription,
which means the narcotic status gives a
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription, gives reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question mark is if it's not a
narcotic anymore, like CBD, which is also
[SPEAKER_01]: not a prescription product and not
reimbursed, what will happen with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in the medicinal field?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I think there will be a big
question mark opening, and when you hear
[SPEAKER_01]: it before the political discussion,
they will try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have the whole health insurance
companies, 130 I think at present,
[SPEAKER_01]: who will not be really the ones to bring
it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to fix something which has been lost is
again a process of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might find yourself in a few
months or years pretty disappointed when
[SPEAKER_01]: the prescription might not come,
because I don't know what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions will then happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to feel pity with doctors to make a
prescription on narcotics who daily
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribe fentanyl, abestral, and all the
opiates is maybe not clear to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody knows more about it,
but talking with the doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: associations, I never saw that this is a
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to have it as a narcotic,
does it delete the memory that it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic and has some harm at the doctor's
perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is questions which would have
been maybe also interesting to ask a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor who is unfortunately not here
today, but I think I would clarify that
[SPEAKER_01]: before, before moving something forward,
which might be maybe a release for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis clubs, but to my personal
assessment are pretty far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was very nicely mentioned
also before that there are several federal
[SPEAKER_01]: state who already told that they will not
allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same was the pilot project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are so many hurdles
piling up in a lot of kind of visionary
[SPEAKER_01]: developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really strongly recommend to think
about the existing possibilities which are
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, which are clear, which are
accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe why all your companies are
presently on the market here is to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: system which is reimbursing very important
medical treat, which has an unbelievable
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for unmet medical need in more
than 44 diseases, which are presently
[SPEAKER_01]: defined.
[SPEAKER_07]: May I just ask a question as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to do so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you say that removing cannabis from
the Narcotics Act might have implications
[SPEAKER_07]: for doctors not prescribing it or
prescribing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are not on the prescription
list anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which prescription list?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that drugs come on up?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go too deep into pharma,
which is my background, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: over-the-counter product, which are not
reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are Magistrate Preparations,
which are not reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have products which are by
legislation reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are, for example, narcotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as cannabis is not yet a marketing
authorization process, which went through
[SPEAKER_01]: the GBA to be listed in the prescription,
I don't understand under which kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: status it will be reimbursed then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zita, what do you think of this conflict
between dried flowers and finished
[SPEAKER_03]: products?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your point on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that dried flowers had an
absolute, absolute authorization to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have spoken with so many doctors who
were so delighted to have a quick reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: medication against heavy pains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not comparable to anything
what is presently on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just take one sample cluster headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody had heard about
it, but this is something, as soon as it
[SPEAKER_01]: starts, people are ready to commit
suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no medication who is stopping
this kind of heavy pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have about three million
people with heavy pain, and we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage, I can recommend to you,
University of Essen is here, in the lead
[SPEAKER_01]: for this cluster headache with a big reach
through Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wave of flowers is giving during
minutes a relief, and this is the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time they receive a medication which is
working so quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's also another one
which we did not have, and unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: we are missing data, but I think it is
pretty clear having such a long
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition time that we cannot generate
data so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what I see also as our task,
is to speak to regulators to find a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we found it for all other medical
challenges, a kind of registration path
[SPEAKER_01]: which enables you to bring a product as
quickly on the market, maybe a marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization under condition,
maybe with a patient registry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are in discussion with several
regulators who are really listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: such kind of proposals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also not to forget the commercial part
is to have some kind of data safety which
[SPEAKER_01]: allows you not to be replicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm understanding being here a few days
and also that sometimes you are desperate
[SPEAKER_01]: about difficulties, but maybe you may take
it also as a chance, but everything which
[SPEAKER_01]: is difficult is not impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything which is not impossible is
reachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strategy, and it's a strategy of
your self-protection, and make it for
[SPEAKER_01]: competition maybe a little bit difficult,
and you might find yourself in a niche as
[SPEAKER_01]: pharma does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might say, oh, what have I to do
with pharma?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You produce pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are in pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome you in a business which is so
wonderful to treat patients, to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful experience, to be part of this
healing system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe one day of you, everybody of us
will be patient and we'll be very grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: for these options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spoke with Dr. Steyer, very happy to
have more options in their toolbox to
[SPEAKER_01]: treat patients so I do not see resistance
against flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you think of these cannabis
clinics coming up?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming online here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something you support with your
organization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that presently the German
clinical acts are very clear about what
[SPEAKER_01]: they consider clinics, and we have the
full provision, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, I will not put a
statement on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know too few about the processes and how
they work on that, but I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to regulators, it is also seen
critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel, Switzerland is timely ahead of us
in Germany in terms of model projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are thinking about introducing model
projects here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please tell us, how long did that last?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that take from the first day of the
decision of let's have a model project
[SPEAKER_03]: until they really became implemented in
Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what can Germany learn from your
experiences?
[SPEAKER_03]: So much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, in fact, it's funny because
we've been watching very closely what's
[SPEAKER_06]: happening in Germany for months now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was quite a disappointment to see
in which direction it goes, and especially
[SPEAKER_06]: the opening up of recreational markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we understand there's going to be two
tiers.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second tier here in Germany is what we
already implemented in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_06]: It started, I would say, around 2017 when
the Federal Committee for Addiction Issues
[SPEAKER_06]: issued a report claiming, and rightly so,
that drug policy in Switzerland has
[SPEAKER_06]: failed, period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they took, for example, Portugal as a
model and other countries where there is a
[SPEAKER_06]: more open approach to narcotics in
general.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that led to two movements.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the one hand, medical cannabis was
opened up further.
[SPEAKER_06]: And last year was implemented a change in
law whereby every doctor now can prescribe
[SPEAKER_06]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You no longer need a special permit from
the Federal Office of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know the issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doctors don't prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know how.
[SPEAKER_06]: All these issues are there in Switzerland
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we hope it's going to change soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's more and more creative
solutions to tackle that.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, there is a movement
that opened up and the realization of
[SPEAKER_06]: politicians that they need to do something
about this recreational market.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Switzerland, there's give or take
300,000 to 500,000, depending who you ask,
[SPEAKER_06]: regular cannabis consumers, of which
100,000 claim they take it for medical
[SPEAKER_06]: purposes and of which 200,000 to 400,000
are consuming for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a lot if you consider that the
entire population is eight or nine
[SPEAKER_06]: million.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really we're a population where
cannabis is very pervasive throughout the
[SPEAKER_06]: society and also I would say relatively
open.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've held already in the 90s,
we've had a very open market,
[SPEAKER_06]: circumvention of certain laws where people
were able to buy cannabis in scented bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would buy this scented bag in a
shop perfectly open.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would ask which strain and you would
buy it for a hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would buy a little bag and people were
smoking it openly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Long story short, it's really only since
about one and a half, two years that the
[SPEAKER_06]: law has been enacted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it led to a change in the Narcotics
Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me read you now quickly what it
says and what the framework is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from that, I'll give you some more
flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after consulting the cantons and
communes, we have cantons, concerned the
[SPEAKER_06]: federal health ministry may authorize
scientific pilot trials involving
[SPEAKER_06]: narcotics containing an effective
concentration of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: What that means, I will tell you in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: A, that are limited in terms of location,
time and subject matter, that allow
[SPEAKER_06]: findings to be made on the impact of new
regulations on the use of these narcotics
[SPEAKER_06]: for non-medical purposes and on the health
of participants that are conducted so as
[SPEAKER_06]: to ensure that the protection of health
and of minors and the protection of public
[SPEAKER_06]: order and public safety and in which,
if possible, cannabis products are used
[SPEAKER_06]: that are of Swiss origin and that comply
with the rules of Swiss organic farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are certain limitations here as
you see.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the limitations is location has to
be limited to a certain municipality.
[SPEAKER_06]: It cannot go and be over all of
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time is five years plus an option for an
extension of two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Subject matter has to be clearly within a
scientific scope and usually in the
[SPEAKER_06]: context of and with the support of a
research institution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not an easy quick fix.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not such a quick thing to just say
we're gonna do a pilot project.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to have money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to finance a scientific study.
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually it's quite capital and time
intensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't underestimate how
complicated it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody here in Germany,
that's what you could learn from us maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: is if you're interested to conduct such a
study, don't wait until pillar two falls
[SPEAKER_06]: into place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come to Switzerland and see how it already
works and get, you know, do your homework.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then findings to be made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, the scope has to be defined.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea is to analyze health,
psychological health, physical health.
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to that, consumer behavior is
one thing that is being analyzed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Youth protection, all these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just define your scope very clearly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you may be able to proceed with
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, the way it works now,
there's five or six different model
[SPEAKER_06]: projects that already have been approved
and are getting into motion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the first one was in Basel and it's
dispensary in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So patients can sign up to the study.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a few hundred people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were always concerned because many of
these people, they have to give their
[SPEAKER_06]: name, their address.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to report back on a regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's data being collected on these
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always said before, me including,
I was completely wrong, that people will
[SPEAKER_06]: not do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: People already are, that cannabis readily
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can buy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why sign up for this and go all this
length?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reality is that it was pretty much
sold out, you know, in a few days.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just filled, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the main reason for that is that
people want to get clean product.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an excellent track and trace
solution that is implemented in
[SPEAKER_06]: Switzerland in conjunction with a
privately held company that one tender
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Ministry of Health, essentially
to conduct track and trace.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the biggest issues in
Switzerland today is that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis products out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And cannabis is probably one of the most
dangerous drugs, period, in the market
[SPEAKER_06]: today because a lot of it is spiced up and
has synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic
[SPEAKER_06]: THC and is incredibly potent and people
don't know what they're buying.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the interest was really, really there
to get access to these trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all now waiting for the Zurich
trial to commence where we have 21 points
[SPEAKER_06]: of sale, including 10 pharmacies and 10
social clubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see how that rolls out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what we all are fearing that
we have these model projects implemented
[SPEAKER_03]: within the next five years until we have
defined the study design, financing,
[SPEAKER_03]: secured, et cetera, and then another five
years evaluation period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe there will be legalization in
Germany in the next decade.
[SPEAKER_06]: May I just add one thing to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: The model projects are just one layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is another layer in Switzerland that
is going on, which is on the political
[SPEAKER_06]: arena because there was a parliamentary
initiative in parallel that has been
[SPEAKER_06]: launched and essentially the parliament or
the health commissions that are relevant
[SPEAKER_06]: in the context already approved.
[SPEAKER_06]: A full legalization of cannabis in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean that it's going to
happen very soon, but it does mean that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no, you mentioned this initiative
and nothing happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there is a subcommittee now in
Switzerland that is actually already
[SPEAKER_06]: working on drafting the legislation
together, obviously with the federal
[SPEAKER_06]: office of public health.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I very much hope that they're looking
at Germany and that they say we can be a
[SPEAKER_06]: bit more courageous than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, you heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No commercial route in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you still come?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Germany needs to be comfortable with a
medical system that has elements of a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial adult use system.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to use from a commercial
standpoint and let's face it, we are all
[SPEAKER_05]: about having access to patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all about a medical framework here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for businesses to survive,
what has to happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys know the answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a business to survive, there has to be
an economic model.
[SPEAKER_05]: For there to be an economic model,
you need to have purchasers on a regular
[SPEAKER_05]: basis for all of the wares that come out
of all of the expensive infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Germany needs to get comfortable with
this notion that it's going to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: medical model that is slippery.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean by slippery?
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning that it is in certain ways
masquerading as an adult use program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be called adult use for
us to be comfortable with it having adult
[SPEAKER_05]: use elements.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just has to be legal and regulated so
that the purchaser is buying something
[SPEAKER_05]: that's consistent and quality driven.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most important point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective is tainted a bit because
that's how it started in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: In most states, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at California as a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Oregon, Colorado, where I call
home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado, once we had 100,000 patients
registered in a medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was game over.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a commercial regulated system.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have in Colorado what we call a severe
pain catchall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning if I have a migraine, you talk
about the cluster headaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have back pain, I qualify to purchase
as much cannabis as I'm lawfully allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: to purchase.
[SPEAKER_05]: That opened the floodgates because I
didn't really have to have a technical
[SPEAKER_05]: medical condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had to have an experience of pain
validated by a physician.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if I wanted to game the system,
if I wanted to go to a doctor and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: doc, my back hurts, can you give me a card
to let me purchase cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine out of 10 times a doctor's going to
do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the system became a bit strained.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what did it do?
[SPEAKER_05]: It created the financial and economic legs
underneath of it which were necessary for
[SPEAKER_05]: it to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just start a system,
have everybody line up at the start line,
[SPEAKER_05]: build infrastructure, and then give a
trickle of patients to the existing system
[SPEAKER_05]: that needs patients' consumer dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm also a bit jaded, Kai, in that
medical marijuana in the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't really mean medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't mean that there's not a
medicinal benefit to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we all know that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means that the purchaser has to
qualify under a condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just qualifies the purchaser.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another way to qualify the purchaser is to
say you must be 21 years old or over.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So medical cannabis in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: simply means safe, consistent access to
cannabis for whatever reason I should
[SPEAKER_05]: choose to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the notion that we need
to get comfortable with, particularly here
[SPEAKER_05]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fascinating experiment,
Kai, and that's why I'm here, is to see it
[SPEAKER_05]: happen in real time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously to hang out and see great
friends and to see what's happening
[SPEAKER_05]: because it happens uniquely country by
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two other points I'd like to make quickly
and that is you have to understand a
[SPEAKER_05]: jurisdiction's why.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that the jurisdiction legalizes
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's critical because not any jurisdiction
legalizes it for the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's for adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's criminal justice reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's social justice reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's because you need an
economic driver.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need job creations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't look at any of those reasons and go
oh, that's not why we're doing it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and look down on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what you think.
[SPEAKER_05]: It matters what the sentiment is in that
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last thing I'll note,
at least now, is there's really four
[SPEAKER_05]: models for cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's four policy lanes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They exist already.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need to invent them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the industrial lane, speaks for
itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second lane, FDA or the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Approved formulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: The third lane, nutraceutical products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Products that come from the cannabis plant
that are for health-based purposes that
[SPEAKER_05]: don't produce an intoxicating effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fourth lane, OTC.
[SPEAKER_05]: You understand OTC, over-the-counter?
[SPEAKER_05]: OTC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Germany, you mix all three of the last
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't mix over-the-counter cannabis,
FDA, approved medicines, and
[SPEAKER_05]: nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be separated, because the
systems already exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Policy makers, bureaucrats, business
owners are used to those three lanes
[SPEAKER_05]: existing independently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, you throw them all together
under the guise of medical, and maybe just
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit with this social club
experiment that's coming, that it begins
[SPEAKER_05]: to open up that OTC lane just a little
bit, just enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because I say it, but I think it
matters that it's coming from a lawyer,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're trained to respect and
understand existing policy frameworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those frameworks exist already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I take away from this is the
medical cannabis market in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: were facilitating the recreational market,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had also like model projects or
social clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they play any role in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: in the legalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: Short answer, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still struggle in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: with this idea of consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where to consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Social clubs having an element of
consumption allowance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't really embrace that in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're starting to get our heads around
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevada, Las Vegas will be an interesting,
interesting way to see how this evolves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other states have evolved a little bit,
but the social club model is not something
[SPEAKER_05]: that's really in vogue and really not
understood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Policy makers want to legalize it,
but they want a very tightly controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: supply chain down to the consumer who does
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pays tax money.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all the governments care about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, we have one minute left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is the panel over soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: One question, if possible, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Kai Newman and
everybody, first of all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for a quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a long history of your personal use
with cannabis before you discovered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody have one quick question?
[SPEAKER_02]: There.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a microphone right there for you,
sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Michael will run up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hurry up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's wearing the comfortable shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how his hair bounces in the wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a very quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think, especially in Germany
and Europe, will we go into the direction
[SPEAKER_04]: of clinical trials as currently in
Germany, cannabis is an unlicensed
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So will we get cannabis flowers that have
an MAH, a marketing authorization,
[SPEAKER_04]: or will there be different models,
maybe using observational data,
[SPEAKER_04]: real world evidence, or like a shortcut?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or will it just stay as it is at the
moment to be unlicensed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Question for Philipp or Sita.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for flowers, it will be difficult
because they are not protectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many flowers right now in
the German market that's really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a group of patients together to
really get some data which will talk for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: For extracts, I think it is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have a bit more of
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there are already some studies
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be more studies going on to
gather data and show exactly what effect
[SPEAKER_00]: has it for patients in different
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would add to that that there's never
anything which is impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my career in pharma, we started like
medical gases, impossible to register.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biologicals, impossible to register.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can name a few other parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end, they have been registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the correlation, proof of
concept, and the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the indication and the product has to
fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have here proof of concept,
then happy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say something to add
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: My pizza seller says you can make the best
pizza in town, but if nobody knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will not sell one piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you think about here about the
situation in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the doctors are not knowing what you
have, they will not prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there are a lot of wonderful
models who do a perfect job on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look for that, I think you will
find your way and a very successful high
[SPEAKER_01]: margin way to be in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
Thank you.
