[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and thank you to Alex for
hosting this fantastic event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all very pleased to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have very esteemed colleagues on my
panel today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the Canadian component of cannabis
in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to turn it over to my panel
to introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be doing just a couple of
presentations so that you can get to know
[SPEAKER_01]: us a little bit better and know what
services we offer in Canada and how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: help you raise capital and go public if
that's something that you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to turn it over,
Anna, if you wouldn't mind introducing
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Anna Serin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Director of Listings Development with
the Canadian Securities Exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a stock exchange on the other side
of the border and host the most cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: companies than any other stock exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also open for business for U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, which has been great things for
us and put us on the map.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Marouf Raza.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the accountant in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with a firm called MNP in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got in very early when Canada was
legalizing medical about five,
[SPEAKER_05]: six years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: We act for probably half the issuers in
Canada, and since then we've broadened our
[SPEAKER_05]: scope to obviously, we were the only firm
in Canada that will really do U.S.
listings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now globally, we're working anywhere
cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to bring them into Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And help some of our people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Mark Lawson, and I represent
Claremont Capital Partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm based in Toronto, and I'm really here
wearing two hats, one being a director of
[SPEAKER_03]: a listed company on the Canadian
Securities Exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here with the rest of the team to
promote the virtues of accessing capital
[SPEAKER_03]: and listing on the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And number two, also represent an overseas
family office that invests in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is John Kirk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a stockbroker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Vancouver, BC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a Canadian based dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a wholly owned subsidiary called
Haywood USA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We finance a lot of cannabis companies,
private, public, and we have the unique
[SPEAKER_04]: ability that we can service U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: investors that are investing in Canadian
listed companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can deal with all the legends,
all the resale restrictions, and this has
[SPEAKER_04]: been a fantastic opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: We provide service, and happy to talk to
any of you after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to start by introducing you
to Stockhouse in general for those of you
[SPEAKER_01]: who are unfamiliar with what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are one of the largest small cap
investor bases in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over 1.3 million unique online
investors every month visiting our site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a hugely trafficked financial
portal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our membership is basically we have over 8
million visitors a month, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to our site to do their due
diligence and research any public traded
[SPEAKER_01]: company with a ticker symbol on any North
American exchange and do their due
[SPEAKER_01]: diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aggregate content so you can look at
stock charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at quotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at any press releases and
materials of your favorite companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically our investors are looking to
invest in the small cap space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in particular is a huge component
of our site currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're spending time on our site.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spending up to nine minutes so
they're really looking and reading and
[SPEAKER_01]: researching what investment opportunities
are out there currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a membership base of over 400,000
members and 136,000 opt-in subscribers in
[SPEAKER_01]: our email component.
[SPEAKER_01]: So membership is free on Stockhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have sort of a unique component
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called our bullboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our bullboards are an unmoderated
almost chat that our investors are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to communicate with each other,
again by ticker symbol, to discuss
[SPEAKER_01]: investment opportunities, what's going on
with the company, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week we put out our top buzz on the
bullboards, and it's basically the most
[SPEAKER_01]: viewed stocks on site, which really gives
you an idea of what investors are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at, what companies they're keen on,
that sort of thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interest on Stockhouse has changed
significantly in the last 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been around for about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And traditionally we had a lot of interest
in mining and metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, with cannabis coming on the
scene, that's completely turned itself
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis tech, blockchain,
that's well over 60% of what our retail
[SPEAKER_01]: investors are looking for and looking at
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our top reads, again, are significantly in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a new investor, just to give
you an idea of what the landscape is
[SPEAKER_01]: looking like in the retail investment
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the millennials have come into
capital markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 18 months ago, people were saying,
oh, no, millennials aren't going to invest
[SPEAKER_01]: in public equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be looking at crowdfunding,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis has completely changed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capital markets, they prove the capital
market's completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have significantly increased our
millennial investor on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And millennials are quick on the uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're looking for things they can
relate to, and that's why cannabis fit the
[SPEAKER_01]: bill for them so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great audience that you can
target to teach them about your company
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you're doing, and really get the
word out there and amplify your message as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as what makes you unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you start to look at going public
and work down that road, just letting
[SPEAKER_01]: people know what your milestones are with
your company that you're planning on
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, I'm going to turn it over to
Anna Serin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, she's with the Canadian Securities
Exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she can speak a little bit more about
what the CSE does and how they can help
[SPEAKER_01]: take you public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Cindy.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could get a show of hands in the
room, how many of you are investors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what a great room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, my name's Anna Serin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with the Canadian Securities Exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get into some information
about what it looks like to go public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I don't bore you too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are based out of... Our main operations
are in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm based out of our Vancouver office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what happened is there was a
change in the healthcare program in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took the stance as a stock exchange
that we would allow companies to list with
[SPEAKER_02]: us that we're applying for their
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other exchanges decided that you need
to already have your application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that the platform was built
out, you had to grow your facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: build your facility to get to that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which obviously requires a large amount of
capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very difficult to go and go find
those sums of capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go into a bank and borrow the
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the opportunity for us allowed these
companies to come flooding to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, what happened is the
retail investor absolutely adored the
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were willing and happy to invest
in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this started around 2014 on the
Canadian side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the 475 companies that we host,
about 125 of them are in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 50 of those have U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: assets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: entrance came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first application from a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: company was Golden Leaf Holdings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CSE is an overnight 15-year
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see as we trucked along,
slowly growing as an exchange,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happened over the past few years
has very much been driven by the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 124 cannabis-related issuers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's growing so quickly that this is
probably already out of date.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 billion enterprise value of cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And $2.6 billion was raised in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis sector in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's happening so quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That number is probably much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's really interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take a look at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: one in 2017 and the numbers that were
raised versus 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're seeing the trend is that
the Canadian space, although it did quite
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we have some issues with our
legalization process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of these companies, although they
have huge market capitalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't actually generate a huge amount
of revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the retail investor is starting to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and where the opportunity there
is on this side of the border is you have
[SPEAKER_02]: fantastic companies that actually generate
revenue, that actually have assets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're seeing a lot of the Canadian
companies in the space start to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: consolidation mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a lot of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're coming on this side of the
border and they're trying to gobble up as
[SPEAKER_02]: many U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: assets as they can, as well U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: companies are just coming on our side of
the border to go public.
[SPEAKER_02]: This really is starting to become a global
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hope is that, you know,
we have the opportunity over the past few
[SPEAKER_02]: decades to be known across the world in
the junior space for the resource sector
[SPEAKER_02]: and mining.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that we'll be the next leaders
in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, there's lots of consolidation
that we're starting to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And consolidation, you know, really
there's just so much ability to raise
[SPEAKER_02]: capital that people are racing out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I'm starting to see,
and it's mainly on this side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: border, is the branding side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone's racing to create their band.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's obviously a lot of product that's
coming to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wants to be the next Coca-Cola of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try and go through this part pretty
quickly because it's just technical
[SPEAKER_02]: information about what you need to go
public.
[SPEAKER_02]: But please do, if you ever have any
questions, give any of us a call at the
[SPEAKER_02]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll happily walk you through the nuts
and bolts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically need to become a qualifying,
sorry, qualify as a reporting issuer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be an active business,
have sufficient public distribution,
[SPEAKER_02]: and meet shared structure guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few different ways that you can
do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all are the absolute perfect way,
but for each unique company, there might
[SPEAKER_02]: be one avenue that is better for you than
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure that you're working with the
right people who understand capital
[SPEAKER_02]: markets and can guide you down this road.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first route is obviously the IPO.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably what most people
understand, the initial public offering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people will take this route and start
as a brand new company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll follow prospectus with our
commission and raise capital at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: they go public, also gaining their
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next route is called an RTO.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is traditionally for a company
that had an active business, it didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: succeed, and they want to create
shareholder value, so they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: acquire a new asset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes this is the right move for your
individual company, but it does have its
[SPEAKER_02]: own glitches in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quite often, if the company was in an
active business outside of the space,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to do a change of business,
you need to get shareholder approval.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some added steps to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a non-offering prospectus,
and that's essentially for a company that
[SPEAKER_02]: already has their shareholders,
you need at least 150, you already have
[SPEAKER_02]: your working capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you're doing is filing a prospectus
with the commission and going public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, people will take this route
because the shareholders that come into
[SPEAKER_02]: the private company, it provides them with
an exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something else called shells,
and I get this call many times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a shell program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a shell program is, is when
somebody builds a company with no
[SPEAKER_02]: intention of putting in a business,
they then go and seek out the business
[SPEAKER_02]: once it's been built to bring that into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have a shell program at the
CSE, but our listing requirements are less
[SPEAKER_02]: arduous than other exchanges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there really isn't any reason that you
shouldn't be able to go through the RTO or
[SPEAKER_02]: IPO process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business requirements, demonstrable
revenue, recent history as a listed
[SPEAKER_02]: company, aka if you were listed on another
exchange, minimum working capital,
[SPEAKER_02]: and resources to achieve stated
objectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 12 months following the listing,
we don't tell you what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell us what you need in the next 12
months as far as your working capital
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go the IPO route, the one nice
feature we have in our policies is builder
[SPEAKER_02]: shares.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the founders of these companies,
we know that you guys are all very
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneurial and deserve to reap the
benefit of building these companies up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can offer out 25% of your outstanding
shares as builder shares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, a company to be public,
it needs 150 shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% of that needs to be free trading.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would highly suggest that you always
have more than 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate when we see companies
stick right to this, and then they go to
[SPEAKER_02]: market and go, well, no one's buying my
stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, only 10% people have stock that they
can trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really good idea to make sure
that, like I said, you're working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: right groups of people who are bringing in
the right shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis companies do have some added
requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's still not federally legal
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way that we have taken to it is we
just want you to disclose all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: risks to your shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for an exchange that has 475
companies, I think we have about 170 in
[SPEAKER_02]: the queue is the last number I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a huge opportunity in the US,
and especially in the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're open for business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Saru.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to briefly chat about the
accounting side, not to bore you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we wanted to talk about accounting
specifically because a lot of the issuers
[SPEAKER_05]: that are coming north of the border to get
capitalized, one of the big bottlenecks
[SPEAKER_05]: that they end up getting into is not
understanding the rules that are required
[SPEAKER_05]: to go public in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the main items is the financial
statement side.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to talk briefly about what
those rules are because if you prep in
[SPEAKER_05]: advance, it's going to save you a
significant amount of time as part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from a process perspective,
go public can take two to three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can take six to nine months.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on how prepared you are with
the financial aspects of your deal and of
[SPEAKER_05]: your numbers, you're going to end up on
the shorter end of that time scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the primary requirement if you're a
company thinking about going public in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada is you need two years of audited
financial statements.
[SPEAKER_05]: The beauty from a Canadian perspective is
if you haven't existed for two years,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come in as a new business with
less than two years of operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So especially for the companies that are
in the cannabis space, sometimes they're
[SPEAKER_05]: newer, but they have the right idea and
the right team, you can actually go public
[SPEAKER_05]: without having this long history.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you compare that, for example,
with the US, US usually need to have three
[SPEAKER_05]: years of operational results that you need
to report, which is not the same in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's quite attractive from a new
company perspective coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, both years need to be audited.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of smaller companies that
also choose to go public in Canada because
[SPEAKER_05]: we actually have great venture capital
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so our public markets in Canada
actually play the role that you guys may
[SPEAKER_05]: be used to from a venture cap space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of venture capital money is
raised here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not all of the companies are sitting
there with 50 million in revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have smaller companies that do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what the nice thing is that our
exchanges recognize that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to provide less burden on those
smaller companies, you only need one year
[SPEAKER_05]: of audited financial statements if your
revenue and assets are under 10 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's quite beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: It eliminates a lot of cost burden in
terms of the going public.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something you should definitely
keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on the timing, you'll also need
interim financial statements for your
[SPEAKER_05]: latest quarter.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to have those audited.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are reviewed, which is a lower level
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's a little bit more
streamlined.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the final financial item that you'd
need as part of your listing is what's
[SPEAKER_05]: known as a pro forma financial statement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we use the word pro forma, but it's not
a projection.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not how the company is going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a financial statement that
affects the transaction to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: here's how you're going to look like as a
public company with all of your
[SPEAKER_05]: shareholders, with all of your financings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not audited or reviewed,
but it's something you have to have in the
[SPEAKER_05]: back of your head as part of this process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one key item for the people in this
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Canada, we use international
financial reporting standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is different from what you guys are
used to from an American perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: being US GAAP.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for the international people in the
room, they know exactly what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: For Americans, US GAAP is not permitted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there can be substantive differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're service providers or the
people you're working with, right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: from a financial perspective, are not
versed in this, it's an area you may want
[SPEAKER_05]: to think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: From an auditor perspective, so obviously
as a public company, you're going to need
[SPEAKER_05]: an auditor both before and after.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you go public, you can use an
auditor that's not registered in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're public, your auditor has to be
registered in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we work with issuers and we have
partnerships both in Canada and the US,
[SPEAKER_05]: because obviously not everybody plays in
the space, as you guys know, in the US,
[SPEAKER_05]: and certainly in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most firms will not touch anything with US
operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into a little bit more details
as we go, but that's sort of the high
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much, Marouf.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you know a little bit about who
we are and how we can help you and what we
[SPEAKER_01]: do, let's get into raising capital in the
cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can start at the end with John and
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have a lot of experience in this
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kinds of financings are you seeing in
the space currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the company types that you're
seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What stage of growth are they at?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really wetting the retail
investor's appetite at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the last two years, there's
approximately 6 billion raised in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of money that's been sucked
out of the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we're going to see as much
this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the money is looking for
maybe more unique opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really could have bought anything 18
months ago and made some money without
[SPEAKER_04]: doing as much research as I think you're
going to have to do now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the ancillary opportunities are
very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be anything packaged and
packaging, transportation, security,
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution, insurance, banking as it
relates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be as easy, but I think
the opportunities have never been greater.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 200 plus public companies,
as I understand right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There aren't 200 phone companies or 200
beverage companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to start to see some M
&A in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're talking about the cultivators,
at the end of the day, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tomato.
[SPEAKER_04]: Margins are going to get squeezed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prices are going to come down,
especially as we open up statewide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that means more M&A.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have to have more scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like John Sally said, if you can find the
Louis XIII or the Louis Très or make
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself unique, then you have an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether that cottage brewery type model,
I think you're okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be about cost with the
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the ancillary businesses are the
most exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I see a lot of the new money
flowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to touch on a few things that John
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very interesting time.
[SPEAKER_03]: As he mentioned, the last 24 months we've
seen unprecedented liquidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if that continues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to speak a bit to valuations.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my previous life, as a banker,
we'd always say valuation is an art form
[SPEAKER_03]: and not a science.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take a look at where things are right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the US multi-state players are
trading at, from a valuation standpoint,
[SPEAKER_03]: an average of about 6.8 times revenue and
about 22 times EBITDA, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This morning, I was looking at a research
report focused around some of the Canadian
[SPEAKER_03]: LPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is learned from us Canadians on
the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at two of the bigger players,
Canopy and Aurora, Canopy has about 30%
[SPEAKER_03]: market share.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of the Canadian LPs will do
about a billion dollars in sale between
[SPEAKER_03]: rec and medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting is Canopy and Aurora
are already reporting their Q2 and Q3
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers for 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: The estimates that they will report
anywhere from negative 37 to negative 44
[SPEAKER_03]: million in EBITDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they're ramping up, they're incurring
all these costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is we're seeing private companies
that are looking to raise money,
[SPEAKER_03]: their valuations are being underpinned by
their forward-looking EBITDA and revenue
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers for 19 and 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: That then begs the question, as an
investor in a nascent industry like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there's very limited history of
operating, sometimes you need to take a
[SPEAKER_03]: step back from the hype because no one has
really started to report yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really starting to change the way
investors are approaching new companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're starting to feel like it's not
enough just to put together a sexy
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation and project 100 million in
EBITDA for 19 and that's it because we're
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to see the chickens come home to
roost, especially in Canada, in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's actuality versus what I like to
call the FOMO moment and the hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: As John mentioned, there was just big
retail rush.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one wanted to miss out on the next
tremendous opportunity and we kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: joked that more unicorns were created in
the cannabis sector in a quarter than
[SPEAKER_03]: probably here in Silicon Valley in the
last two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to take a step back, I think
investors are starting to look more,
[SPEAKER_03]: the instrument of choice right now is
really convertible to ventures and some
[SPEAKER_03]: people are using caps on valuation to
protect their upside.
[SPEAKER_03]: The point I think I'm trying to make is as
much as there is a lot of excitement in
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry and I think it's tremendous
what's happening and the whole value chain
[SPEAKER_03]: has changed and we think more people need
to be looking, as John mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the ancillary services, whether it's
supply chain and logistics or banking or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of us really need to go back to the
fundamentals of these businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want to chime in?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say I think obviously
it's been a big hype and we've seen it
[SPEAKER_02]: going and running for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an investor, what I would start looking
at in new companies coming in is the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to raise capital doesn't
necessarily mean that you need to or
[SPEAKER_02]: should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these more tightly held structures
might be something to look at or if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at going public, you don't
necessarily need to raise hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: millions of dollars and dilute out your
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really hard to maintain in good and
bad markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely take a look at more
tightly held structures as an investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marouf, you have seen a lot of US
companies coming to List in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak to any major reports of
consideration for a US company that is
[SPEAKER_01]: considering listing on a Canadian
exchange?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think preparedness is obviously for any
company particularly important as part of
[SPEAKER_05]: a go public transaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I indicated, your timelines to go
public can wildly fluctuate depending on
[SPEAKER_05]: how prepared you are going in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the stuff we talked about,
you need to know what it is like to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian public company.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have people who understand the
international accounting rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: One particular area on the accounting side
that is specific to the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_05]: is we're captured under this agriculture
standard that exists in accounting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The key takeaway for this group is we have
to fair value the accounting plans as they
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It ties into some of the discussions that
were happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the cannabis world for cultivators,
you recognize your profit before you sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a weird rule and there's a
lot of judgments and estimates that go
[SPEAKER_05]: into it that people are wholly unprepared
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: A big part of that that comes in and
people are obviously trying to reconcile
[SPEAKER_05]: it out is a big sort of non-cash amount
that's a fair value pick up that you
[SPEAKER_05]: basically pick up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a half grown plant, it's 50%.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you do as you grow is you recognize
the profit on that half grown plant before
[SPEAKER_05]: you sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very confusing to investors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that ultimately has to be
reconciled.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that there's a lot of
time and effort that goes into coming up
[SPEAKER_05]: with that modeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: The securities commissions are looking at
that very closely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something from a purely financial
standpoint that we need to deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other part and this is particularly a
US issue on the tax side.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the founders on the tax side,
there's a US IRS issue called inversion.
[SPEAKER_05]: What that is is when a US company exits
into a different jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_05]: so a company coming public into Canada as
an example, in many cases the US doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize that as an exit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They continue to consider you as a US
entity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadians, now because you're a Canadian
company, expect you to be taxed as a
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a potential risk for double
taxation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something we structure around but
it's something we need to deal with
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise you're going to be in a
situation where you potentially have two
[SPEAKER_05]: countries looking at you from a tax
revenue perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really the high level side
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna, maybe you can speak a little bit to
what the benefits are to US companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where we are, to going public on
the CSE.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the advantage of a US company
listing on your exchange?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm their only option firstly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously with legislation going on on
this side of the border, it's really hard
[SPEAKER_02]: to engage in the capital markets at this
moment in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your ability to list in Canada,
I know it's probably a little foreign to
[SPEAKER_02]: people to think about listing their
company on an exchange in another country,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's been some real huge success
for US companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone has the desire at some
point to grow and move into a senior
[SPEAKER_02]: exchange and that doesn't take their
ability away.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is it lets them start off as
a public company on our exchange,
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy the benefits of being able to raise
capital anytime that you need to because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're set up and giving your investors
their exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you want, you can move to the
senior exchanges.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing about us is we have a very
close relationship with the OTC markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our companies that do come and
list with us, once you're listed with us,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're a recognized foreign exchange with
OTC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You automatically get your OTC ticker and
now it allows your US investors to
[SPEAKER_02]: participate in your stock.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and along those lines, maybe John,
you can speak to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haywood Securities is accepting US clients
currently, so that's a bit of a change in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can explain how US investors can
actually invest in Canadian public
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been very difficult for a US resident
to invest in a private placement or
[SPEAKER_04]: prospective software.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're offering most US banks haven't been
able to touch it the last two years or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Haywood Securities, through our platform,
can actually service a US resident who
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to access some of these more
lucrative placements.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you participate in a private
placement or an IPO, you'll often get a
[SPEAKER_04]: sweetener.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be a warrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll give you potentially 50 or 100% more
upside.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really missing out if you don't get
in the deals, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen many in the last year that if
you were in the IPO or the RTO,
[SPEAKER_04]: listing offering, they'd open up at very
nice premiums and you really never had a
[SPEAKER_04]: chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the platforms in the US,
they're talking about going live.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know through OTC, there are some
options, but if you want to invest in a
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadian listed company, you're better
dealing with a Canadian dealer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know how the stocks trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have more liquidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a fantastic opportunity for
Haywood because what we're seeing is we're
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing so many amazing investors who are
investing in these companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't get liquidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: This gives me hope that this market's
going to continue for a while because I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with ex-BlackRock guys,
ex-Goldman guys who've gone and set up
[SPEAKER_04]: family offices to participate in these
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're telling me that all their friends
on Wall Street, they cannot wait to get
[SPEAKER_04]: into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have handcuffs on.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they're going to come off this
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that really is exciting because
any of us who are investing now,
[SPEAKER_04]: there truly is a lot more money that wants
to come into the sector that can't or has
[SPEAKER_04]: not figured it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be the next wave for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to throw this out to all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see the next wave globally in
the cannabis sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is obviously a global leader in the
sector, so what other opportunities in
[SPEAKER_01]: your perspective do you see coming up?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when you look at it at a very
macro level, the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_05]: certainly in Canada, US has obviously
carved out of some of this discussion just
[SPEAKER_05]: because of the way the regulations are
here, but in Canada, the last few years,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was an arms race towards cultivation
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who can raise the most amount of money and
grow the biggest and baddest greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation space?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody actually asked the question,
is that actually accretive?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your cost?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because nobody was paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was what Mark was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this fictitious valuation that was
there, but nobody actually said,
[SPEAKER_05]: are these companies going to be
profitable?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are recognizing that
cultivation in a place like Canada is
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe not the highest and best use of
resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're seeing at a macro level is a
lot of these Canadian companies that are
[SPEAKER_05]: very well funded, cultivation is going to
be commoditized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's going to be a premium element
for the premium brands, but most of it is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be going into extraction,
going to be going into yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, what you care about
is the cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what a lot of the Canadian
companies are doing or other companies
[SPEAKER_05]: that are coming into Canada worldwide,
it's a focus on low-cost cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: leading to extraction and then leading
to... I think we're going to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: that movement happening and I think Canada
is well capitalized either for those
[SPEAKER_05]: companies to come to Canada themselves and
become public companies or for the
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian, the big guys to go out and
basically secure us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot of Canadian companies
going out and securing licenses in
[SPEAKER_05]: low-cost jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Canada will continue to be the IP
and capital center.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that role in other industries
like in mining and oil and gas and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: almost like it's replicating itself in
this sector as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's already starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next frontier is really in emerging
markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an example, two weeks ago, Pharmacy
Yellow out of Columbia listed,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their stock was probably up to
200% or 300%.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you look around the world,
sometimes we have an insular view of our
[SPEAKER_03]: own backyard, whether it's in Toronto or
California, but as an example,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're going to Sao Paulo or Mexico
City or Lagos, Nigeria, you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about cities that have 20 million people
with 7% GDP growth and this is really the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's the EU, we've seen companies
that have already obtained licenses in
[SPEAKER_03]: Denmark and Israel, wherever the case may
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also need to think about outside of
North America, there are other
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions where you have ideal
climates for cultivation all year round.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bogota, Colombia, outside of Medellin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really believe as valuables and
situations maybe start to get frothy in
[SPEAKER_03]: North America, we really need to start to
look to emerging markets and it's already
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing transactions in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: You name it, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, somebody was talking to me
about Papua New Guinea, which is maybe...
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tricky jurisdiction in the middle
of nowhere, not much infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think if you want to expose yourself
to returns, you really need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the emerging markets and to
your point, we can argue that maybe the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation play is getting commoditized,
but if you are an LP here and if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: an export license, how do you ship that
product to the EU?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence comes in the whole supply chain and
logistics piece and the value chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a tremendous opportunity to really
invest outside of North America in
[SPEAKER_03]: different parts of that whole cannabis
value chain in the emerging markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anna, do you wanna weigh in on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think what you're gonna see kind
of in the near future, I think everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: really excited to get involved in the
recreational space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all been in the medicinal side for a
few years as this has evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the companies that I'm seeing
kind of really get a lot of attention in
[SPEAKER_02]: the market is the companies that are doing
the pure recreational play.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, I think you're also, as to us and
Mark said, the global stuff is really
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to come to play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the people that are coming to
market, we had a downturn in the small cap
[SPEAKER_02]: space that lasted about five years and a
few of us held on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what was nice about this is really
kind of brought, and it's been brought up
[SPEAKER_02]: a few times now, it's really brought in
the next generation of investor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next generation of investor has a
completely different experience than we
[SPEAKER_02]: did when we started because they have
discount brokerage accounts and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: access to information that is immediate,
it's at their fingertips, it's right on
[SPEAKER_02]: their phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't realize, it's been a short period
of time that we've had access,
[SPEAKER_02]: this immediate information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely would guide people to go and
talk to proper professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's gonna be tough for investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not quite sure where it's gonna go
because we don't understand this new
[SPEAKER_02]: investor that's come to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're moving along the markets as
they learn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you very much for all your
input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, if we are gonna throw
it out to you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time for Cindy Broad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fantastic panel is very
informative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Bueller, right here, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good, you're quick with the
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any company out there putting
together an emerging market index fund?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wants to take that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've seen different, some
companies like institutional asset
[SPEAKER_03]: managers starting to put together funds,
but to date have not seen any asset
[SPEAKER_03]: managers that are focused strictly on the
emerging markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's you, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a public company in Canada
that it's not a fund, but it has a focus
[SPEAKER_05]: of just going and securing licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a couple like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of their business
operational mandate, but they're not a
[SPEAKER_05]: fund.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in Canada, there are ETFs that are
cannabis type ETFs, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_05]: emerging market ETF or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Name of that company?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the ETF, of the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can share it offline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I sit down, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice socks.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to recommend all the men
wearing fancy socks today.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is regarding the price pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you see the price and the possible
profit margins curve look like moving
[SPEAKER_07]: forward?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the major drivers?
[SPEAKER_07]: And secondly, are there other product
category at the end of the supply chain
[SPEAKER_07]: that might emerge that might have impact
on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Profit pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: As the accountant, I can answer the first
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first one, not to be facetious,
every pitch that we hear across this room,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sure you guys have heard,
every person, there's two things they talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: How their growing technique is the best
and how they are the lowest cost producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So until we actually see those results,
it's impossible to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: All I can tell you is in Canada,
people are struggling to get under a
[SPEAKER_05]: dollar all in cost per gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the US, maybe it's a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we see Sub-Saharan Africa,
they're at 10 cents a gram all in.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we see Colombia, they're at 35 cents
a gram all in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know where your targets are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the top lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know where they're going to
shake out, but that's what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: competing against.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's real early days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my advice to everyone is bet on the
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: People who can execute.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have realistic expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen so many of these presentations
with these hockey stick graphs where
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to go from 5 million to 20
million to 200 million in three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just not believable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's all true.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as Mark said, the chickens will come
home to roost.
[SPEAKER_04]: These presentations that have been used to
market and raise billions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be a reckoning for some of
these companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them will execute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm betting on the people who have a
track record, not just in cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_04]: but as businessmen, as people,
people who've gone to the markets and have
[SPEAKER_04]: had success year over year, different
industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you want to look for.
[SPEAKER_04]: No promoters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one thing I'll add is I personally
and humbly believe that you guys have a
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendous opportunity, because one can
argue that regulation in the US kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: made the junior capital markets extinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless my numbers are wrong,
I believe California is the equivalent of
[SPEAKER_03]: the fifth largest economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we see in terms of the difference
between the Canadian companies and the
[SPEAKER_03]: American companies, I'm not being
unpatriotic, but in the US there's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: history of building bigger brands or house
of brands in much bigger markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a tremendous advantage for any
entrepreneurs in the room that want to
[SPEAKER_03]: access capital in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other part of it is,
and this is where the, there's a big
[SPEAKER_05]: difference between the US and non-US
globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: The US, this whole concept of a vertically
integrated operator, where the farmer is
[SPEAKER_05]: the retailer and the distributor,
and the dispensary, that's a very,
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't exist in any other industry in
the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pharmaceutical company that makes
opiates does not grow opium.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't, sorry, poppy seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the question becomes, can you be
good at everything?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you be the best retailer and the best
farmer?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, economic history would suggest
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because of the way, and Canada was the
same, because of the way the rules were
[SPEAKER_05]: written, you had to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to be part of the entire process
chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Canada, we're already seeing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Micro licenses are coming out where you're
gonna specialize.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna be extraction only.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna buy your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have no interest in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a pharmaceutical extraction person.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you know about growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you bother learning when
somebody's doing it perfectly and
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiently?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think from a product perspective,
who knows what products are gonna come
[SPEAKER_05]: out, but the segments are absolutely going
to separate.
[SPEAKER_05]: US, who knows, but rest of the world,
it is gonna be different people doing
[SPEAKER_05]: specialized aspects of the value chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all so very, very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it once again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, we're out of time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to keep moving on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they'll be happy to talk to you
on the other side of the wall over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you like to say?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you to the panel
and let you guys know that we are all
[SPEAKER_01]: available all day for any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stockhouse actually has a booth that we're
sharing with the CSE in the main exhibit
[SPEAKER_01]: hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do want meetings or you want to
come pick up a card or you have any other
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that you didn't get to ask us,
please, we're all happy to take your
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just wanted to let you know that we
have partnered with ICBC and MMP and we
[SPEAKER_01]: are putting on a portion of this
conference with some of the exhibitors
[SPEAKER_01]: that are here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Society, Bang, just to name a few
plus products, Flocana, Wagner Dimas as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that online conference will be on,
you've got a card in your bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: February 20th at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can jump on and see everybody
presenting their companies live and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can ask questions of all the CEOs live
online as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a text-based chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn about the companies and then
ask questions directly to the management
[SPEAKER_01]: teams and the CEOs and that is produced as
part of the event as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please be sure and check that out.
