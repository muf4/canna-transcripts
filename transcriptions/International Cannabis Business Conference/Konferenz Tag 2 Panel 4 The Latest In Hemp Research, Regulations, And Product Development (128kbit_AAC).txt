[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome on this panel on the latest in
hemp research, regulations, and product
[SPEAKER_03]: development.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the great pleasure to have here on
this panel with me today Patrick Atagui,
[SPEAKER_03]: President and CEO of the National
Industrial Hemp Council, David Trela,
[SPEAKER_03]: Senior Managing Director at Golden Eagle
Partner, and Bhujidhar Rathishik.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an activist for human rights and
cannabis as a medicine and event
[SPEAKER_03]: organizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Project manager and founder at the
Research National Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just jump straight in,
maybe start with you Patrick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have extensive experience in
advocating for the hemp industry in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you share some insights on the
challenges faced by the industry in
[SPEAKER_03]: navigating the patchwork of regulations
that apply in industrial hemp and how the
[SPEAKER_03]: NIHC is working to address these
challenges?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely, and I think Eric set the
stage perfectly for this discussion,
[SPEAKER_04]: and one is the plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: The National Industrial Hemp Council was
founded in March of 2019.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a 10-year plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been executing that and have hit our
benchmarks in spite of COVID, in spite of
[SPEAKER_04]: the downturn, because we're very focused
on two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you come to our booth and meet
Lakshmi Mahan, we're working on the NIHC
[SPEAKER_04]: plus verify program.
[SPEAKER_04]: For product, for testing, and third-party
certification.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the first half of what the NIHC
does is consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making sure the consumer is safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to work for the American Chemistry
Council, and my clients were Dow,
[SPEAKER_04]: DuPont, PPG, et cetera, and oxychemical,
and that was during the time of BPA,
[SPEAKER_04]: bisphenol A, and that's where the consumer
lost confidence in a perfectly good
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical that was used to make
shatterproof bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water bottles, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the first of what NIHC does,
and that's what the NIHC verify program
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second part is regulatory certainty
and working with the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the reason I'm here is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Agriculture funds us for the
market access program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are the only U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: association that receives federal funding,
and that's because the government picks
[SPEAKER_04]: one entity, and we support others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Global Hemp Association and Hemp
Industry Association, we have MOUs with
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're in the same space, but we're
very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the government has said to us,
saying, you are the ones that we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: work with, but we bring them along too,
so we're the single funding source.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of the panelists,
but just really quickly, so what does that
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get market access program funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was being able to use federal funds
to promote hemp, not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're very targeted, and that's why
this discussion is hemp and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that took two years to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went through the Office of General
Counsel through the USDA, explained to
[SPEAKER_04]: them the difference you would think
lawyers would know, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: nuances, so we achieved that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We received roughly a quarter of a million
dollars there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next step is getting on the technical
assistance for specialty crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have four grants through the USDA,
and we can talk to folks later about
[SPEAKER_04]: those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are life cycle analysis of fiber
is one.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is a regulatory analysis of the
European market and what are the hurdles
[SPEAKER_04]: for getting US companies into the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also, I serve on a committee
appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_04]: and the US Trade Representative Ambassador
Tai and Secretary Vilsack, appointed by
[SPEAKER_04]: both of those agencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I serve on the tobacco, cotton,
peanut, and now, historically and
[SPEAKER_04]: monumental, it's now hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a federal agency, two of them,
the US Trade Representative's Office and
[SPEAKER_04]: the USDA, and it's now the, for our
efforts, it's tobacco, cotton,
[SPEAKER_04]: peanuts, and hemp committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also serve on the products committee on
tasks, and we're also trying to get on
[SPEAKER_04]: another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's ups and downs,
but the bottom line is, and in government,
[SPEAKER_04]: the FDA, we all know that, but government
is changing and moving forward,
[SPEAKER_04]: and funding, and actually funding hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I'll stop, we're very limited
on time, but I want to focus on the
[SPEAKER_04]: positive, that things are happening,
and it is, it's a long-term.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Eric said, it's a 10-year plan,
it's not a three months, six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're doing, very slow and
steady, moving forward and moving hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also with the farm bill that just changed,
can you maybe explain a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: about that to the audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: How this affected, like this regulation
affected everything inside the framework?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the 2018 farm bill, Legalize
Hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Senator Mitch McConnell,
who was the majority leader at the time
[SPEAKER_04]: from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, another association,
US Hemp Roundtable, was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: had a very close relationship with him,
and really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on Capitol Hill, I used to work for
a senator in the late 1990s, and I would
[SPEAKER_04]: see this legislation come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was from North Dakota or farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is perfectly good,
but, you know, again, as people have
[SPEAKER_04]: noted, the evil weed, you know,
the bad, you know, MJ, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Jane, and those type of things,
but they saw the positives of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think it will end up,
at the end of the day, and my colleagues
[SPEAKER_04]: on the panel will talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's an F1 racing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, automotive was mentioned
at 20% in BMW, and it's because why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bottom line is money, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheaper than carbon fiber,
lighter weight, better fuel efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the long-term, yes,
hemp is here to stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been here for thousands of years,
and only in the United States has it been
[SPEAKER_04]: a short time of about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just put this in really quickly,
since this is a business of business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the opportunity that we see is in Asia,
with Thailand opening up their marketplace
[SPEAKER_04]: to legalize hemp, marijuana, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they did it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see, you know, the
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't import hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, you know, that's different,
but it's the IP.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we're involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: The National Desert Hemp Council,
we funded the 2022 Asian Hemp Expo.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a 2023 Asian Hemp Expo.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see excitement,
that's where you need to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan is changing its laws on hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, there's really only one farmer
who can grow it, and it's used for
[SPEAKER_04]: ceremonial use for the Emperor's Closing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've been in contact with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Embassy, with the Japanese government,
and you're going to see that changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That goes into discussion of the 0.2,
0.3 percent in those questions they were
[SPEAKER_04]: asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've partnered with, for those who
are interested in funding, AWR Lloyd.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're about the size of the Canadians,
about a McKinsey or Bain, bringing
[SPEAKER_04]: companies into Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is B2B, so we're going to have
that conversation there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, PE, private equity, but also
just the regulatory getting into those
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to be positive, and I want to
provide people that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Farm Bill is happening,
so it legalizes it in 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the answer to the question,
hopefully it's 1 percent that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: pushing for.
[SPEAKER_04]: 31 organizations, we're getting together
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: First time that's ever happened,
and it's just working together works,
[SPEAKER_04]: is our slogan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we do work together, other things
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, having advised cannabis companies
for several years, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: key regulatory challenges that you see
that companies are facing in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: research and product development,
maybe in particular with regard to hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: or as you call it, THC minus cannabis?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Lisa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when we're saying cannabis,
as Lisa said, if you saw me, we are a
[SPEAKER_02]: global investor farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put together cannabis as a genus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we consider, you know, marijuana,
people don't like that term, so we're
[SPEAKER_02]: calling it THC plus, THC minus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But frankly, the regulatory hurdles are a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, the regulators frankly don't know
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can speak for that because,
for example, you know, we had the interim
[SPEAKER_02]: final rule, which in itself speaks to kind
of what government is about, and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of say that because both my parents
were politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as one thing you can say is,
like for example, the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe let me step back and talk
about the farm bill that went through
[SPEAKER_02]: before I get to talking about the
authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the problems is the fact that not
everybody gets the memo, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, we had the 2018 farm bill
passed in December 2018, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a hemp client based in Colorado
that ordered a shipment from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're from the state, you might
remember this.
[SPEAKER_02]: December 20, January 2019, it's going
through Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truck runs a stoplight and the cops
pull it over and they look in the back and
[SPEAKER_02]: they think it's the biggest drug bust in
history.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it turns out the truck drivers got
thrown in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they end up testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives you an idea of the
arbitrariness of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go ahead and test.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truckload and probably I think half of
it wasn't hot, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's supposed to be hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they test, you know, certain buds
or parts of it and it's hot because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: over point three percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they consider it hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out our client didn't get that
truckload for another 18 months and they
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up suing the state of Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing, as far as regulatory
authorities go, it is just it's tough
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you know the Therapeutic Goods
Administration in Australia, they recently
[SPEAKER_02]: had a proclamation in late 2020 that said,
OK, we're done with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this mess with CBD and medicinal cannabis
down under.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're going to allow is you can
produce a drug with one hundred and fifty
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram CBD or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as most people know, that usually is
probably not going to deliver the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they allow this, but then they kind of
pull it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you talk to a lot of leading
scientists like Hunter Land, he thinks
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just totally arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the FDA's recent
proclamation that came out and essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: said, as everybody knows, CBD in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: is ruled as a drug because of the
Epidiolex president.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now CBD is a drug that can't be used in
anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the FDA has recently come out and
said, OK, well, if you have a product in
[SPEAKER_02]: wellness and everything else, it can't be
used if it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to run through a clinical process
unless it's a vape product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a vape product with CBD,
they're not going to try to shut that
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you can get CBD from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, the regulatory hurdles tend to
be pretty substantial because they tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: be arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good bridge also to you,
Bozita.
[SPEAKER_03]: What progress have you witnessed in terms
of acceptance and understanding of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and also maybe hemp as a
legitimate medical option?
[SPEAKER_03]: And are there any particular challenges
that still need to be addressed in order
[SPEAKER_03]: to further advance the use of cannabis or
hemp for medicinal purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As my colleague said, on this field is
complete confusion inside the EU that even
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't mention the word, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really very hard to deal
nationally and internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key is the education of
general public and professional because
[SPEAKER_01]: they only can push.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we tried many years now like
activists, but if doesn't come the impulse
[SPEAKER_01]: from the, you know, doctors and nurses,
I don't think it will change very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is that before they start
to treat cannabis as it should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be another 10 years, at least
because cannabis is not in curriculum,
[SPEAKER_01]: not in the medical schools, not a bit now
in the faculty of pharmacy in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still, I think only through education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with cannabis is mostly
bureaucratic obstacles and over-regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: before it even comes to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you are a part of,
you have a human rights, a rights
[SPEAKER_03]: organization, FIST, but you're also a
member of IACM.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you see any other aspects other than
education, like access programs,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, for patients, even maybe for
hemp-based medicine?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like, we have this big part
where a lot of people are using CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle products as medicines,
potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, is there also a gap in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: The gap is now that people get more and
more informed about it, but I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis as a plant, as a gene,
should be allowed also with all other
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds because I think just talking
about the CBD and health, it's about a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit hypocritical, you know,
because we all know how the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, in this rigid situation,
especially inside the EU, I don't see a
[SPEAKER_01]: very bright future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you see what is happening in
Portugal, in France, all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it gets more complicated every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Patrick, let's jump back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some impacts of the current
regulations and how are they impacting,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, cultivation processing,
the sale of hemp products?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can the industry adapt to these
varying limits of THC globally?
[SPEAKER_03]: And ensure compliance while maximizing the
potential of hemp-based products?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Locally, you know, it's a mess,
to be perfectly honest with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, to do research in New York,
you need to pay for your crop to be
[SPEAKER_04]: tested, $300.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to be fingerprinted.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for Cornell University, Ivy League
School, top agricultural school,
[SPEAKER_04]: higher education in the country,
they're having a difficult time,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting product, you know,
through to be tested or to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, worked on for their research.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just one example.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a patchwork, you know,
as we talked about, of regulations and
[SPEAKER_04]: rules and laws and they're ever-changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, even the interstate,
we talked about the trucking, interstate
[SPEAKER_04]: transportation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even getting into the
pesticides or herbicide use requirements
[SPEAKER_04]: by the Environmental Protection Agency
because you can use it on one crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't mean you can use it on another.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, every state has a different
rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then overall, federally, you know,
if it's hot, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a class one drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's the social impact
to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we mentioned before, why is
marijuana, cannabis, a class one drug?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's because you can easily
arrest people of a certain demographic and
[SPEAKER_04]: put them in jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, you know, what is an
answer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Universities are looking at countries like
Thailand, right, because you can go there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can do the research, inexpensive for
labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to worry about having a hot
crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're finding ways to, I don't want
to say get around, but to be able to do
[SPEAKER_04]: their research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I keep pointing to Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's very, very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was there last year in Bangkok,
you know, the comment was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the marijuana and we all know those strict
regulations of being caned or even
[SPEAKER_04]: executed for drug trafficking.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they said, but that's the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: based on the 1940s, 1950s at the United
Nation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went along because that's what the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they're saying, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: We use cannabis, we've used it for
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even when it was illegal,
so to speak, you know, farmers out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: countryside were using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the issue of
cross-pollination contamination because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, because marijuana is used in
what is grown in one part of the country
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the climate and the altitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hemp is grown in another and they look
totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, in the U.S., yeah,
it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully it gets straightened out in
the farm bill, some, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and 31 other organizations are pushing for
1%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, hopefully some other things
happen along those lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the opportunities are amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're out there and just going
to the right place at the right time and
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll find a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's a finance-driven
proposal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think Asia is where you're going
to see a lot of this happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we look around and say,
well, you know, the market's up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at from where it was legal
and you take out the highs and lows,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, overall, it's an upward climb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not steep, but it's a very slow and
steady.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think, you know,
we need to be as you need to be slow and
[SPEAKER_04]: steady and think about it and build just
as our organization has been slow and
[SPEAKER_04]: steady in building.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a very good reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't say that just because
I'm here saying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the proof is, you know, is in the
taste and the pudding is that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we do get government grants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we are on government committees.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we are getting government
funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, long answer to your short
question, it's a hot mess in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States.
[SPEAKER_04]: As everybody's been saying, but there's
opportunity and it's being at the right
[SPEAKER_04]: place at the right time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Asia is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, David, you have your background.
[SPEAKER_03]: In biotech and you have been working in
this background for quite some like in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see an overlap or an interest
also from conventional industry in the
[SPEAKER_03]: commodity hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, thank you, Lisa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that's really kind of funny
about this, actually, is this panel
[SPEAKER_02]: actually should be one of the most
interesting, well attended panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I say that is if you
look at cannabis again, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: you define it as essentially, well,
everybody knows the typical cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_02]: has what, 100, 500 compounds, 150
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the flavonoids, the terpenes,
all these different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these molecules are amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have all these molecules that we've
really not understood what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have on the other side,
it's a three pronged wheel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all the molecules here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all the indications, potential
indications that could be used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the human genetics side,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody has metabolized a lot of
these molecules differently, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work at a company called
Affymetrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one of the first companies to coin
the term pharmacogenomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I say that this should
be the most interesting panel is let's
[SPEAKER_02]: take out one of those molecules,
which is delta 9 THC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, that molecule determines
a lot of these regulations, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you take that molecule out,
then you have CBC, CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we could go on for a long time,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, if you really look at the
potential of this plant and you take out
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, this whole experiment, to us,
it's the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_02]: The holy grail is to find out which of
these molecules, or by themselves or in
[SPEAKER_02]: combination, are effective for treating
and give an indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, one of our clients is a
public company in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to run a pivotal trial with
CBD and insomnia, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of low-hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken CBC cannabichromine recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's kind of interesting that,
yeah, if you talk about the science side,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of science to be applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, next year, this is more of
a, you know, well-attended panel,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think, to me, that's where the
future of this is going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just going to be dependent on
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta 9, that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, delta 8 might be a different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's get back to you, Bujita.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any research that has caught your
attention recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would you say any specific areas in
research that you believe hold great
[SPEAKER_03]: promise for the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cannabis is the most researched
plant on the planet, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 150,000 studies in the last 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, not, but I hope there will be
very soon that somebody or something could
[SPEAKER_01]: work on the, you know, how to modulate
human endocannabinoid system with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the key, and this should
be the key research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we don't develop the special
cannabinoid for each disease, but hope the
[SPEAKER_01]: best modulate the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this should be the key,
because we all know now how the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system works, and I hope
we will have methods in the near future to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure the levels and the activities in
the human body.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think are these confused
regulations that we have been talking
[SPEAKER_03]: before, are they impacting us as an
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, of course, especially, you know,
we are running a lab in Ljubljana and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to follow all the regulations as for
drug trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we buy, I don't know, one gram of
standard THC standard, you have to fulfill
[SPEAKER_01]: the old regulations like you will,
you know, be drug trafficker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is very hard then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another one is exchange of the
samples between the laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's very hard because if you
cannot send Delta 9, you can, but it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there are many obstacles on the way,
yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could add one thing to that real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about research regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big problems has been the
stigma, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, let's take a good example
with biotech, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Watson and Crick elucidate the
structure with a lot of help from Rosalind
[SPEAKER_02]: Franklin, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 1953, 1973, Cohen and Boyer developed
recombinant DNA technology, which really
[SPEAKER_02]: spawns a whole industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which then spawns Genentech, which goes
public five years later in 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple years later,
we have human recombinant insulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, getting back to professor's earlier
comment, let's look at the fact that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have Rafi Mishulam, God rest his soul,
was a star, finds Delta 9 in the mid-60s,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 64, 65, and then we don't
find and determine that we have an
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system until 93 or 92,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that is how long ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had, you know, we had,
Marinol was really not a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an analog on the market, which really
hasn't done a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the potential of this industry has,
I think, really been held back,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only regulations, but stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the potential, if we can unlock that
and unwrap that, you know, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be really, really exciting next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I just want to add something.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they discovered or isolated the
insulin, it was one year from isolation to
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know about the endocannabinoid
system for 30 years, and nothing happens,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are interests, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot more things could happen,
maybe, like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really like your question,
though, like what technology is out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: and why is it different?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have a video that shows rope
and those type of things, and sails.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, even if you replaced
everything with hemp, it still really
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't make a dent, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But the technology is different now,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at it, the most recent that came
out a few weeks ago was being used in road
[SPEAKER_04]: construction because of the high tensile
strength of hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think, wow, you know,
we're not going to make roads out of hemp,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like ethanol and fuel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in clothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not be 100% hemp, but it's going to
be a blend, and you have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, technology, the really cool
stuff is batteries.
[SPEAKER_04]: The carbon structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, hemp and batteries.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you read into it, it's that it
replaces the heavy metals and lithium ion
[SPEAKER_04]: batteries, and that carbon structure is
very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you reduce the cost significantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, it's as a commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I mean, yes, you have the CBD,
but it's like comparing apples on a tree
[SPEAKER_04]: to pine and hardwood.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very different for different uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sure, you can use wood from an
apple tree, but for industrial use,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not what you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think for the very long term that
hemp is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a state, and we're only in it for a
very short time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for the United States anyway,
for other countries longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it has established itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a commodity, as others have noted
in their presentations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think that's where the end day
hemp will really succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have time for one more question,
but maybe let's have a round of applause
[SPEAKER_03]: for the panelists before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Eli.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Tel Aviv.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a clinic in Israel with
approximately 6,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a patient that we aid,
and I wanted to ask Mr. Bojidar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have heard that you are working with
suppositories, and there's been talking
[SPEAKER_00]: and laughing about this subject,
this convention so much, so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been hearing there's so much
things going on with this kind of curing
[SPEAKER_00]: of people, and I feel like there's not a
lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think your lab can cooperate with
other labs and even bring that knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and that technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can tell the audience about
the technique, it's amazing, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: curing cancer and a lot of disease,
and I haven't seen a lot of techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: like that at doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear from you if it's
something that is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At D, we help people with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the point why we established
institute and the laboratory, so we
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor also what people are taking from
black market or whatever for their safety,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we also teach, it's nothing new
in Slovenia, because we also teach
[SPEAKER_01]: patients how to take cannabis properly on
the different occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lectures like Association for
Multiple Sclerosis or Tetraplegic
[SPEAKER_01]: Associations and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people and our general public in
Slovenia is very much aware of those
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder why it's not that much popular
overseas, like in the States or Israel,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in Europe or in Slovenia or area,
it's very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, people have also very good
results with many different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I heard better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's making it so... What's the magic?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's magic, and I think it's better
bioavailability of cannabinoids for the
[SPEAKER_01]: human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, everybody, and enjoy the
rest of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
