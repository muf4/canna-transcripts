[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when a movement becomes an
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, what happens when that
industry happens in a fragmented way,
[SPEAKER_00]: globally, and there's no uniformity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do people create commerce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what most people in this room
and most people in this industry are
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the exciting thing that I get
to talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, I'm a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't want to hear from a
lawyer unless you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here to try to give you some
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does an American-based lawyer matter
in Berlin, Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of 13 years in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you what you're going to
hear next from Beau Whitney is that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are repeatable patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are demonstrable trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those patterns happen over and over again
all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: What changes is the timeline of those
changes coming into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timeline is often dictated by the
population of the jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's those patterns, that timeline that
I'm trying to talk about this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a question, please raise your
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can work it in, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that this is as
informative as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lead Clark Hill's global cannabis
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of my partners are here with me,
Sanders Exespi from Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes companies public.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an SEC lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, those companies here that are
operating lawfully in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction you're in, there's access to
public markets, to capital markets in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, with my partner Sam out of our
Dublin office, and I'd encourage you to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a close look if you're operating
globally and incorporating your company,
[SPEAKER_00]: registering it in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of reasons for that that
I won't get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you couple those two things
together, you're situated properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have low taxation rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have protection from insolvency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you don't get in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, you have access to
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or more access to capital than most
companies in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I talk about the global supply
chain, why does that matter for you folks
[SPEAKER_00]: working so hard here in Germany to get a
license?
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a store?
[SPEAKER_00]: To hire people that are competent and
qualified?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this matter to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's why it matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a global industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it today, but the supply
chain is global.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it on a mass scale,
but you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commoditization is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not here yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really that close yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what commoditization is?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a commodity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a commodity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Commodity is something that occurs when
you buy or trade it before it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that seed goes in the ground,
it's sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't happened in cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not likely to happen even in a
specific geographic location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the supply chain needs to sort
itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to course correct multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of those changes
that form the backdrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand if you've heard of the UN
Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly a place that we need to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In November of 2020, the UN Committee on
Narcotic Drugs recommended changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommended the recognition of
medicinal cannabis as something new to be
[SPEAKER_00]: treated separately and differently from
the prohibition of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, they recognized that
cannabinoids from industrial hemp or
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial uses such as CBD are not
subject to UN controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, we have not had any mechanism,
no distribution of these concepts to the
[SPEAKER_00]: member nations because it's challenging,
it's time consuming, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that forms the backdrop for what is
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we are not waiting for the United
Nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say we, I mean operators within the
industry, our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's waiting for the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, look at a country like Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends from Uruguay are out on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first, the first country in the
world to outwipe legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a small country, four million
people plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a big impact because there are
people who are participating as one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first nations along with Canada,
now Colombia, Israel, for the exportation
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, the Netherlands, so forth and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's small trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is there small trade right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the distribution systems are not
built for commoditization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're built for a tightly knit,
closed loop system where every single gram
[SPEAKER_00]: is tracked very strictly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a stigma to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about this stigma?
[SPEAKER_00]: The stoner mentality, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: That exists and that is what we have to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving slowly, giving policy makers,
elected officials comfort that operators
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry are actually doing things
the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing things in a way that's
strictly compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In turn, that makes people, regular
people, mothers, fathers, okay if not
[SPEAKER_00]: accepting of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the UN Convention has a lot to do with
it, but countries are not waiting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: UN Convention to be modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you simply opt out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you waive it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you make an argument?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we need to go against the tenets of
the UN Convention regarding cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes of public health and public
safety, national security.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Uruguay looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked at it very closely and we've seen
very little repercussion for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's happening quickly, but the UN
Convention is an impediment, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: blocker to the establishment of a code
cannabis supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the US, we make a major
distinction between hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: That distinction in the US is .3% THC,
of course THC, the psychoactive compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relevant, but a lot less relevant,
that distinction in most countries around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would suggest to you here today that
you don't really need marijuana for the
[SPEAKER_00]: global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really just need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow hemp for $600 per acre in the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow 1,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can capture 1,000 acres at 10 metric
tons per acre at .3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's plenty of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can convert the other compounds to
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can isolate those compounds in a
formulation and a process that is in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: a pharmaceutical ingredient standard,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different industry than what
we're talking about mostly today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the evolution of the global
cannabis supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping cannabinoids, compounds,
and formulations, formulations being the
[SPEAKER_00]: key, around the world for a variety of
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those formulations make their way into
a dispensary in Los Angeles, California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make their way into a pharmacy in
Montevideo, Uruguay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make their way into a dispensary,
that's adult use, in Berlin, Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's those segments of the industry
that I would urge you to challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you have a supply chain,
because you have production, extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, packaging, and retail
capabilities does not mean you're
[SPEAKER_00]: participating in the same industry that
exists for every person that invests in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different sectors and segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the THC percentage is important
because if I want to buy a flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the THC percentage high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the oil extracted from that
distiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that THC percentage high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that the same ingredient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to create a formulation
that's designed to treat, cure,
[SPEAKER_00]: address a specific condition in the human
body, they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they cross in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please understand that, that there are
different segments of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that from a policy
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the turquoise color, the bluish
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That represents regions of the world,
and it's not complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some new regions of the world
that need to be added on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at that map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who'd have thought about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working specifically in this
industry, only in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: for 13 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years of commercial practice,
working on transactions, regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This map gets bluer every single year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations to all of us and the
policymakers that make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at some of the pieces here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, what happens in Germany is
spread across Europe in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to be the pattern for other
policy developments, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial policy developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the German government takes it on,
regulates it, does it well, it will take
[SPEAKER_00]: hold in many locations around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a meeting recently, and that was
in Luxembourg with Germany and several
[SPEAKER_00]: other nearby nations, where they talked
specifically about the tenets for the
[SPEAKER_00]: program with Malta involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta being the first European country,
of course, to legalize cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a small country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think Luxembourg was first,
but not for a commercial dispensational
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole point is there's movement
happening with small but powerful and
[SPEAKER_00]: important countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding how these countries fit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Hoping, I'm just trying to open a
dispensary in Berlin, Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this matter to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters to you because it will be
allowed to be traded commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many countries around the world develop
the program, particularly the Latin
[SPEAKER_00]: American countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That program allows for exportation only.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an imbalance from the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have exportation balanced
with domestic use, it's not much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the Latin American nations
change their laws, change their policies
[SPEAKER_00]: in real time, very rapidly, to address
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at European countries,
we are importing into just about every
[SPEAKER_00]: country with some new exceptions in
Germany and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not necessarily sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does the cannabis come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's new cultivation coming online,
and let's face it, does it make sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: ship cannabis no matter how high quality
it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make sense to ship it?
[SPEAKER_00]: From Colombia, for example, all the way to
the European Union, to Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the cost of transportation
and the cost of production would support
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the long term, particularly when
you have multiple African nations
[SPEAKER_00]: producing cannabis for exportation and
domestic supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon me, international supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Western Hemisphere, I believe that
this will be its own supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the United States as the
outlier, where we have the holy grail,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, of consumers, but those
consumers are limited to the states and
[SPEAKER_00]: limited by the fact that they operate on
the marijuana side in the face of federal
[SPEAKER_00]: illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, our neighbors to the North,
and by Supreme Court mandate, our
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors to the South, or Mexico,
and in multiple countries across the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire region, have an exportation policy,
which they'll soon balance with a domestic
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is its own supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem that way today,
but it will be, and it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that, understand the economics
in the Western Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you import or export, the question
becomes, and I think somebody asked a
[SPEAKER_00]: question on the WOVA app, don't we need
standardization globally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't we need import and export
uniformity?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want your prices to go down,
the answer's yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniformity and consistency does what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows more people to participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow more people to participate,
what happens with the law of supply and
[SPEAKER_00]: demand?
[SPEAKER_00]: More cannabis is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If more cannabis is produced, and the
standards are easy to understand and
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate, is your price point higher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it lower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's going to be lower,
substantially lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not having uniformity globally,
supply chain perspective, is actually not
[SPEAKER_00]: an adverse condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an asset, if you can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people, there's many people
at this conference and in this room that
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to navigate that complex global
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: To navigate the lack of uniformity,
and that's an important piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have distinctions between hemp
and cannabis, CBD and THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing the marketplace explode for
the last 24 plus months here in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBD products, particularly in line
with the novel foods ruling and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the inconsistencies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doesn't it really only matter that I'm
producing something from a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the country or the jurisdiction in
which that plant was produced allows me
[SPEAKER_00]: and licenses it and facilitates the
exportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the recipient country,
you need to have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be able to possess material
that meets their standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be able to import it into the
hands of a licensed producer or a
[SPEAKER_00]: participant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to have a structure behind
it for the dispensation of that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things exist, mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an art to navigating it right
now that if you can navigate it now,
[SPEAKER_00]: now is the time to go out and build that
infrastructure as the price points will be
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the limited movement of infused
cannabinoid products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil moves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see oil move around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see flowers move around the world,
both hemp and marijuana flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we don't necessarily see are
cannabinoid-finished products because in
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction by jurisdiction, the types of
ways to consume cannabis, it's regulated
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's regulated so differently that you
can't import the edible in most
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions, but maybe you can import
the oil and produce the edible in that
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction or the consumable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regulations are your friends,
not your foe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding that intellectual property
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do brands matter in cannabis today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brands matter, but it depends where.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the Willie Nelson, Snoop Dogg
brands come out in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of loyal following for
those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people buy brands or do they simply buy
consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that branding?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Snoop Dogg product doesn't sell,
but the consistent product sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are important things to understand,
but also to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect from an intellectual property
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently in Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mexico City, there are dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensaries are not legal,
but they operate, they look, they feel,
[SPEAKER_00]: they smell like a dispensary that you walk
into in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the products in that dispensary are
branded like California products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question becomes, which I didn't
ask, did you drive in here from California
[SPEAKER_00]: or did you simply print it on the
packaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of both, but my point to
you is protect your brand, protect your
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the protection exists in multiple
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That multiple jurisdictional registration
can protect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be enforceable, despite the
cannabis nature of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important thing to protect,
because if you're not protecting that,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you taking steps to develop your brand
beyond the boundaries of your country?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if I have a solution here in
Germany, and I have a THC brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to go to the next country,
the one that I predict is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: next, what if I did a soft launch for that
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I created CBD products with the same
branding and same packaging in a
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction that was lawful but didn't
allow THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That model has worked all over the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana brands in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone into new jurisdictions that
allowed for CBD from industrial hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: created the brand awareness and brand
recognition before the market allowed for
[SPEAKER_00]: THC products to be sold in that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp applications, we're not
here to talk about hemp, but that's very
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, cannabinoids from hemp
can be aggregated all over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of hectares or acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have cannabinoids,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter whether I get my
cannabinoids from marijuana or hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentration in the individual plant
will matter, but that's dictated by what
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumers want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing major exporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about Columbia recently changing
the law, which by the way, for those of
[SPEAKER_00]: you non-legal minds in the room,
there's legislation and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legislation requires elected officials to
vote on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the top executive would sign
that law into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the regulations, the details,
how something is done, that's left to
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agencies can change rules very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't require voting of a
legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't require political capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations can change very quickly and
that's exactly what happened in Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: recently when they were only allowing the
exportation of oil and they have shifted
[SPEAKER_00]: the policy to also allow for the
exportation of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they recognize a global market
need for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The country was producing flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The operators were not doing so well
because they didn't have the capital to
[SPEAKER_00]: build out their own extraction facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they changed the race.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allowed for exportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: China is the largest cultivator of hemp in
the world, if you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in China advising the Chinese FDA in
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, they told me there was no THC in
that country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a test on one of their hemp plants,
a 14-foot hemp plant two months prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't flour like a traditional
marijuana plant, but it was 13% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they use it for industrial uses,
so I guess it didn't matter at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My point to you is that countries look at
things very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may be stating the obvious, but it's for
you to figure it out and create that as an
[SPEAKER_00]: asset for your business or your
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel has an insatiable demand for
product right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States, from an industrial hemp
perspective, Germany, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, for medicinal purposes very
strictly, and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Brazil changes the global
landscape immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: 210-plus million people with a
nationalized healthcare system that on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own adopted the use of medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a nationalized healthcare system,
if I didn't mention that already,
[SPEAKER_00]: Anvisa, it is a market to watch closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean that Europeans will be
shipping products to Brazil?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but what it does mean is that other
Latin American nations will now open up
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities in Europe and in this region
of the world that is now being satisfied
[SPEAKER_00]: from Latin American exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow these trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch those trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to really take away the four
elements of the global cannabis supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about these four elements,
I talk about them as four policy lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, please think about these
because you need to place your company in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these four lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, or if you're an investor and
you haven't figured out which lane you
[SPEAKER_00]: play in, you're going to lose your
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an operator and you don't know
which lane you play in, the business is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first lane, OTC dispensary model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that I walk into a store and I
could purchase high THC flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can purchase a number of other high THC
products over the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What qualifies me to buy that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm a patient with a specific
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm just 21 years old if it's an
adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over the counter marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you play in that lane or do you play
in, I'm going to jump down to the second
[SPEAKER_00]: one, active pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is medical marijuana, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: API grade ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be formulations approved by the
equivalent of the FDA in every
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction, most jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be real medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a condition, I go to a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor will say, it will take years to
get there, but the doctor will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: take this tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be for some of us,
maybe any of us in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That understand the benefits of the
natural plant, but it will exist and it
[SPEAKER_00]: does exist and we shouldn't be scared of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be scared of pharmaceutical
companies working in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists side by side with the OTC
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third lane, industrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellulose, lignin, sugar, fuels,
plastic, building materials, fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wellness and nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the lane that would be
non-intoxicating cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily derived from industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take CBD out of a hemp plant,
if I take CBN out of a hemp plant and I
[SPEAKER_00]: create those formulations, those are over
the counter nutraceutical or wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rich in proteins, omega-3s,
omega-6s, and they contain cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please understand where you fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing I can encourage all of
you to do in this room is understand your
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fragmented, decentralized
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please understand your context.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you are, where you fit, or else you
won't succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you all to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The versatility of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's talk about this for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what you came here to talk
about, but fiber is making a major push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does fiber from a marijuana crop have any
value?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want long fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the added value for industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want long fibers, and those fibers are
being developed in terms of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: for so many uses, from textiles to door
paneling and automobiles to plastics and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wellness and nutraceuticals speaks for
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see those main uses of cannabis to the
right, and ultimately those things are all
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will somebody come and buy your socks
and your sand and your waste material from
[SPEAKER_00]: you, not just for extracting that extra 1%
THC out of it, but for industrial uses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But industrial hemp is designed to do all
of the above, including produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen the products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're familiar with the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what the marketplace
looks like today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like fiber products,
over-the-counter medicinal or wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: products, vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply these to hemp and or marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply wafer board or fiber board on the
end from industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this industry is not going
anywhere, but it's also why you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the supply chain, because it's
not just intoxicating materials from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, with more uniformity,
with more people participating,
[SPEAKER_00]: the intoxicating products out of the
industry doesn't get more valuable,
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, it gets less valuable when
you create more opportunities and
[SPEAKER_00]: standardize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understand the entirety of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some product categories that are used for
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see cosmetics, whether those cosmetics
include CBD, for example, or THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the cosmetic development going wide
across Latin America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first products that we're seeing
in many Latin American-based stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: lawfully or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some of the first products that we
see going to marijuana dispensaries with
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC for topical application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, products across the United
States and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pet products, pet products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a Uruguayan client of ours a week
ago get a 15-year contract, 15-year supply
[SPEAKER_00]: contract for cannabinoids, including THC,
for pet products in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These agreements are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exist today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please understand and don't get caught up
in everything in your world, because
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what you need to look up is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed, seed's an important concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States recently,
by the way, the DEA sent out a letter in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to a lawyer's inquiry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That letter said there's really no
distinction between hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, every seed is presumed hemp until
it's harvested, because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: determine whether it's 0.3% THC until the
time of harvest, legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's sure things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these European countries that
have produced hemp seeds, marijuana seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years, are rushing to the U.S.
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see that distinction between
seeds as long as they're stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: registered under various OECD or the
equivalent functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the investment trends as we bring
this to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the dollars going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Geographic source of funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot more money outside of the
United States than coming from the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, as I mentioned, if you're lawful
in your jurisdiction, license
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately, public markets and capital
markets are available to you in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the purpose for the funding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you building out facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you expanding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hiring people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to spend your money?
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters in trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Domestic versus export, that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest very strongly that if the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: passes the same banking act or the Client
Act, that the international companies have
[SPEAKER_00]: a much better chance of operating in North
America because the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: companies tend to exist and survive
sometimes in spite of themselves because
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff sells itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas international companies have had
to go through many more hoops,
[SPEAKER_00]: operate in much more complex, operate in
much more sophisticated fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that I would pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product verticals to avoid, intoxicating
products with hemp, we see that,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 8, Delta 10, the number of these
products, much aligned, but something to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: High THC products, the products themselves
are not necessarily being shipped
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally, but the base materials
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The novel cannabinoids, I touched on that,
with intoxicating products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokable hemp, who thought that was
coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that as a trend in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: states that don't have lawful marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: People smoke hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a mild buzz, but it's probably
not what the people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, this number's
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: 23.6 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw an article this morning that said
$75 billion by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly half of that in the U.S.,
North America, half of that
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally in the aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think we're looking at,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And participate in that international
aggregate and when the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: opens up, access the capital for U
.S.-based companies, the opportunity will
[SPEAKER_00]: be yours because you'll have gone through
hoops that are much more stringent and
[SPEAKER_00]: significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, the next
presentation from Beau is about market
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge you to listen and listen
attentively to that because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: flesh out this broad end of the funnel
with some concrete details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right after that at 5 p.m.,
it's another conversation, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: great, about the global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marry these things together,
put a few of these things in your bag of
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks, and please don't ever,
ever hesitate to reach out to myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: my partners, anybody at Clark Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to participate globally,
please take a look at the GCNC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Global Cannabis Network Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an aggregation of network,
the top players around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're very proud to have many of them
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
