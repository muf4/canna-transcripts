[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you very much for coming in
from the food and the sunshine So this
[SPEAKER_05]: panel is about media marketing in the
legal cannabis industry Some of you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: may be aware that this is the 40th
anniversary of the miners strikes in the
[SPEAKER_05]: UK and here on this panel We've got some
Experts who have been working at the coal
[SPEAKER_05]: face of median marketing in the cannabis
industry for many many years probably in
[SPEAKER_05]: some cases for longer than they want to To
remember I'm gonna ask them to introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves in a moment But just before we
do that and just for their benefit Can we
[SPEAKER_05]: just have a show of hands in the audience
of those of you who are currently?
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing a product or service in the
cannabis industry right now and of those

[SPEAKER_05]: service Okay, so a couple okay,
so Well before we get started can ask the
[SPEAKER_05]: panelists Introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Mika we can start with you just in
terms of your background and your general
[SPEAKER_08]: approach to marketing and media in
cannabis Yeah, my name is Michael note I
[SPEAKER_08]: come from Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a freelance journalist writing for
vice magazine other magazines published a
[SPEAKER_08]: book about first German book about
cannabis extraction and I'm running a
[SPEAKER_08]: YouTube channel about cannabis education
Since 15 years no 18 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm running this YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I am quite deep into cannabis
marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I Used to be when it was illegal and now
that it's legal as a medicine I'm also
[SPEAKER_08]: very busy with cannabis marketing in
Germany since 2017 Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much Patrick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you to introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Petra Marinko.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CEO founder and owner of Nabi
brand you probably heard of We've been on
[SPEAKER_02]: many shows here and we choose a bit
different approach on how we want to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: our products how we want to present our
products and I'm really happy to be here
[SPEAKER_02]: and share some of our Stuff with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started this six and a half years ago
seven years ago and My background comes
[SPEAKER_02]: from architecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I chose similar architectural approach
to building a brand and building and
[SPEAKER_02]: making products producing products so I
don't deal with electricians and
[SPEAKER_02]: carpenters anymore so and I Started doing
this with chemists and cosmetologists and
[SPEAKER_02]: medical PhD doctors So it's kind of a same
thing with different packaging so Happy to
[SPEAKER_02]: be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: She won.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Simone Espinoza I flew from Chile and
Ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We founded what is what it is today the
most watched cannabis media in Spanish
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called and voila We create content
educational content and we use humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a background in humor is I will be
funnier That's this one as these go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry have patience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get there but we use humor as a tool
to Make our content approachable by a
[SPEAKER_03]: community that has an urgent need of 10
technical information educational
[SPEAKER_03]: information both in B2B and B2C And we are
one of the largest digital communities in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world for cannabis Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've just come straight from the
airport, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you Start to fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll punch you So I think in the first
place I'd like to go to it again a more
[SPEAKER_05]: general question I think we heard this
morning already that you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's an interesting time for the industry
I think some people would say a
[SPEAKER_05]: challenging time your regulations are not
moving perhaps as quickly and some had
[SPEAKER_05]: hoped Revenues again that revenue growth
is moderating to some extent across
[SPEAKER_05]: different markets categories, etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first question I guess is in terms
of what that means for Marketing how does
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing address that issue?
[SPEAKER_05]: What has changed in the last sort of 12 to
18 months around the way you You address
[SPEAKER_05]: or approach media and marketing and maybe
Petra if I can start with you from a brand
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective How are you kind of
approaching it currently in terms of the
[SPEAKER_05]: current atmosphere and context in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: From brand perspective we started when we
started it was a lot of thinking of how we
[SPEAKER_02]: should do it because there were so many
limitations and We were definitely Not
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to address the influencers with
only one reason because we didn't want our
[SPEAKER_02]: products to be second-best the next time
when other people come and pay more or or
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay different amounts of money that we did
so that was a big no-no for us So how do
[SPEAKER_02]: it then and it was really interesting step
because social media Burst it so much and
[SPEAKER_02]: there was no other way to to do it and the
covid was in All this time, so there were
[SPEAKER_02]: no shows and nothing like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we choose a different Approach and the
for local for I would say local for
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used approach to go to mass market so
we were in selling in hundreds of hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: of shops in Slovenia in every village you
could buy Nabi products and that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest way to For us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really nice way to be presented
somewhere and to to To show ourselves to
[SPEAKER_02]: to get noticed so brand awareness is
something that people should get and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hard for To be noticed if you're not
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for Slovenia, this was a really crucial
thing And we have a shop in Ljubljana or
[SPEAKER_02]: so, which is really we we got the shop for
marketing reasons It turned out that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was also a good selling point because of
all the tourists and every people there
[SPEAKER_02]: and regarding Abroad we choose shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example shows like this ACI CBC
We're here always we just had a joke back
[SPEAKER_02]: there when hi, you're still here and
Congratulations, which is a kind of a big
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in cannabis business when you
survive from year to year We managed to
[SPEAKER_02]: survive and we developed really well in
these times And also thankfully with this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of events.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are able to present ourselves as a
partner that is worth Doing business with
[SPEAKER_02]: and that we show ourselves in different
perspective that people see That we differ
[SPEAKER_02]: and stand out Standing out as I mentioned
now is something that is really important
[SPEAKER_02]: in this kind of business We try to stand
out with Packaging that we use we try to
[SPEAKER_02]: stand out with ingredients that we use
with approach that we have so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Finding a way to differ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that Everybody here knows what
I'm talking about and everybody there That
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really important to Put a point on
yourself and say okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that we do and it's
different from everything else You have
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the most challenging thing to do
in this kind of business But I think we
[SPEAKER_05]: did a pretty good job till now Yes,
and I guess the more challenging the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry in general becomes the more
important it is to be distinctive
[SPEAKER_05]: exception I think we can maybe come back
to that Simon from an agency perspective
[SPEAKER_05]: and again in terms of a more constrained
environment and And challenges that the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry face.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that play out for you from an
agency perspective?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you contribute and what kind of
problems are you solving for your for your
[SPEAKER_05]: partners?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's it's a great question
we've been talking about this for for a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit now and I'm sure many of us if we are
company owners in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever You're from you've suffered quite
a bit chances are these past years have
[SPEAKER_03]: not been the best for our industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Exclusively talking about a marketing
perspective in this area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen Marketing budgets shrinking
many people are unable to allocate as much
[SPEAKER_03]: money or assets or resources on marketing
which means also that they are Letting go
[SPEAKER_03]: of some specific markets that require that
marketing campaign set in place for them
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to capitalize over those
efforts on over the immense effort which
[SPEAKER_03]: is building a brand in this space and In
addition to that we've seen all the
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions that come from everywhere now
I think Michael have a really good point
[SPEAKER_03]: on a really good perspective on what's
happening in Germany But we've also we all
[SPEAKER_03]: known or we've all have our accounts
taking down in social media I'm sure like
[SPEAKER_03]: you've seen that going it's hard to get
any kind of cannabis content out there
[SPEAKER_03]: without being highly restrictive shadow
ban or Just taking down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've found some things in this in this
very intricate maze They're not stable
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It changes because like the guidelines for
social media change So it is challenging
[SPEAKER_03]: and it requires for us to be updated and
it requires for us to be, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: flexible also to be everywhere To
understand how different platforms work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but we what it's also very interesting
for me in in this Crisis I would presume
[SPEAKER_03]: it could be like I don't know if that's
such a dramatic word, but it is it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: hard So I know like we all seen it and we
all have friends in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know how it is But it's also really
good opportunity for companies that are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking into the marketing space
understanding that many other many
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that had in-house marketing
branches are not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue with that so a lot of the
resources are moving to Outsourcing this
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an interesting opportunity for
companies that are moving there to have
[SPEAKER_03]: high margin assets to Provide for our
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say those are the two main
areas in which we've been developing and
[SPEAKER_03]: investigating in these past few years
Trying to be a better asset for our fellow
[SPEAKER_05]: colleagues Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we go I know you have particular
experience with social media and so on and
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get to that in a few moments But
just before we get to that and sticking
[SPEAKER_05]: with kind of the theme of challenges and
there may be people in the audience Who
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know exactly what will be possible
or not possible in the German context
[SPEAKER_05]: moving forward Once we have kanji and so
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you just talk a little bit about I
think largely what won't be possible in
[SPEAKER_05]: the German context, but just so we're all
clear on that from a marketing perspective
[SPEAKER_08]: It's I can say it in quite easy words We
used to cannabis used to be a part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: narcotic act which meant that you were not
allowed to advertise for cannabis but
[SPEAKER_08]: Which in reality meant you were not
allowed to advertise strains But companies
[SPEAKER_08]: were allowed to advertise their brand
which is a smart marketing approach had
[SPEAKER_08]: was needed to Let me say focus certain
strains, but it's it's possible It was
[SPEAKER_08]: possible and now that cannabis is out of
the narcotic act and into the new cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: act It's not unregulated, but it's out of
the narcotic act and into the new cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: act But when it comes to advertising,
it's actually the same like before like it
[SPEAKER_08]: was in the narcotic act but The new law
mentions for example Influencing which was
[SPEAKER_08]: not mentioned before in the which which we
call pharmaceutical Advertisement law we
[SPEAKER_08]: have a pharmaceutical advertisement
Prohibition in Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not allowed and but pharmaceutical
companies are allowed to advertise for
[SPEAKER_08]: their company for their brand and Actually
now for cannabis for recreational
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all the same but influencing is
included So we have to find of course nice
[SPEAKER_08]: smart workarounds in my eyes Which means a
brand should focus on their brand?
[SPEAKER_08]: I have known a nice example for the
alcohol brand for alcohol branding for
[SPEAKER_08]: example All the big beer companies they
sponsor sports event spot spot events But
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not allowed to advertise for alcohol
on sport events, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: They bring out the alcohol free brand
which has the same logo like the alcohol
[SPEAKER_08]: brand or it's a rat instead of blue and
then it's allowed to about to advertise
[SPEAKER_08]: for alcohol free beer on a sports event
and I must just come come back to Petra
[SPEAKER_08]: and I have to contradict a little because
Drama if if any company Does their
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing themselves?
[SPEAKER_08]: We wouldn't sit here So in my eyes also on
a small level in nowadays A smart
[SPEAKER_08]: influencer marketing a smart social.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't have to be done by influencers,
but the smart smart social media Marketing
[SPEAKER_08]: has a very big impact what I must agree on
that in a small country like Slovenia You
[SPEAKER_08]: have a lot of other marketing strategies
which you can use because it's a small
[SPEAKER_08]: country But compared to Spain or to
Germany, it wouldn't be possible to do
[SPEAKER_08]: this kind of marketing What would it
direct trade marketing is different
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult scale?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to give Petra right of reply on
on that So Petra can you just talk a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit about how you use social media
and maybe some kind of key tips for?
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone the audience about approaching
social media as a cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with what you had to say
Michael because Maybe I said influencers a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit harsh to to get it to all
influencers because I was addressing to
[SPEAKER_02]: the paid ones that are selling one Product
today and the other product tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the only thing that I was
addressing but there are many ways to use
[SPEAKER_02]: influencers in a smart way, like you said
and Combining your I don't know ideas with
[SPEAKER_02]: a really known person or or Doing
something with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us our Social media approach was a
bit different and also marketing approach
[SPEAKER_02]: Regarding how we will present that our
products are really good so we choose the
[SPEAKER_02]: approach to to tell people about the feel
that they get from our product not what
[SPEAKER_02]: this product does but you you you you you
try it and you feel it and you will feel
[SPEAKER_02]: it and It was a bit different because
everybody was saying about anti-wrinkle
[SPEAKER_02]: This does this and this does that and
every product has claims on what it does
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't say anything about CBD So how
to do it if you cannot say anything and we
[SPEAKER_02]: choose to talk about the field and it's
showing off that we are gaining a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: followers just because we are talking
about the fields different kind of feel so
[SPEAKER_02]: how can you sleep How do you dream if you
can sleep for example is one of our things
[SPEAKER_02]: with and you get a product for that and It
doesn't say that it will help you sleep,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it says it in a in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was kind of Way that we tried to
to get through all the The the banning
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens and so on and people actually
share our content that's I think Simon
[SPEAKER_02]: will have a lot to say I follow Simon and
he's everywhere and everybody is Sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: your content, which is really interesting
and he has so special approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of Again to differ and to
stand out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so magic it's almost like Petra if
it sounds like you're using poetry or
[SPEAKER_05]: something to Be distinctive and ask people
to see one you used humor a lot in the
[SPEAKER_05]: work that you and your agency does and The
point of that I guess is not just to be
[SPEAKER_05]: funny It's because that enhances the
quality of the interactions you're getting
[SPEAKER_05]: on on the social media sites and Prevents
or protects you a little bit from things
[SPEAKER_05]: like shadow banning and all that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has many layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say and thank you for your words
What we use actually what we're based on
[SPEAKER_03]: is science it's all fully educational
content and that's something that Can
[SPEAKER_03]: transit and move through social media
without as many restrictions as like
[SPEAKER_03]: other?
[SPEAKER_03]: Marketing content for cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_03]: This should be very well known by this
point educational content if it's Marked
[SPEAKER_03]: and tagged as educational content have
like way more chances to not be shadow
[SPEAKER_03]: banned or deleted from any given platform
That being said humor has also like a
[SPEAKER_03]: different Perspective and and and some
many other layers for starters We know
[SPEAKER_03]: that we cannot paid for promotion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Chances are that if we have Cannabis
account a kind of a social media account.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna need organic Following an
organic engage engagement This is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's also basic and should be
very well known at this point that all
[SPEAKER_03]: your resources need to be allocated in
this form of distribution for social media
[SPEAKER_03]: content or audiovisual content for that
matter and Then this is something that
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's a little bit more hard to
measure But I think it our experience can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell us that there's something else in our
community That is something a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: more untangible, but not less real Which
is our own culture and our own culture has
[SPEAKER_03]: a comedy Background that has been lying
there forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was comedians who were among the first
activists for cannabis Just as much as
[SPEAKER_03]: like the hip-hop urban culture as well But
they've been there and we have and I would
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say this for for all of us I hope
I'm right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to Put words in anybody's
mouth, but I think we have predilection
[SPEAKER_03]: for for laughter and we look for health
and for for for a medical experience also
[SPEAKER_03]: in laughter because it has helped us deal
with a lot of what prohibition and stigma
[SPEAKER_03]: has done in us and and Comedy and humor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a therapeutical form of culture as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that Like that's not
necessarily explained but it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: that is also like lying there and is
inherent to our culture and we tapped into
[SPEAKER_03]: that and we noticed that when you laugh
you share and That's something that you
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot pay for in like advertisement So
that's an interesting tool that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: using and we we try to make science funny
We try to make it approachable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to talk to our community in a very
genuine way the way we are and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: also very Important and should be very
well known by now After we've seen what
[SPEAKER_03]: happened with celebrity brands in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all we've all seen it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are exceptions, of course,
but we all know what happens there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being like legit, I would say your
genuine and Coherent to the community
[SPEAKER_03]: something that humor does very well for us
I guess it might also be the case that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis users have a very high detection
level for inauthenticity As well,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I mean speaking of being authentically
yourself Mika Can I ask you to just talk a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit about your experience with
social media?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the challenges you've had and how
you kind of it's an ongoing process I
[SPEAKER_05]: guess in terms of continuing to try and
get your message across and be heard etc
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to cannabis, there are a lot
of challenges.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are legal challenges Stigmatize
stigmatizing challenges.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all in all and I would say you have to
be Storyteller influencers or they have to
[SPEAKER_08]: be a storyteller you have to build a story
around your brand around your product the
[SPEAKER_08]: people want to listen to and Not the
product has to be really in focus,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know It has doesn't have to be in
focus to the most important thing is your
[SPEAKER_08]: story, you know And of course the product
has to be mentioned and everybody has to
[SPEAKER_08]: know what it's about your story But the
story is much more important than the rest
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is also what I say We are good
storytellers as influencers, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're a comedian.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we We are professional storytellers So
if anybody of your companies has a good
[SPEAKER_08]: storyteller who can act in front of the
camera make him your your social media
[SPEAKER_08]: influencer if your company doesn't have
one you should really think about social
[SPEAKER_08]: media marketing because social media
marketing is the most most Attractive
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing the most successful marketing at
the moment and it will this will not
[SPEAKER_08]: change anymore I used to be an author I
used to publish a cannabis magazine in
[SPEAKER_08]: 2004 we started and that was a very
Successful model.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, all cannabis magazines are
fighting to survive, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: and Even micro influence influencers have
an income while the big magazines struggle
[SPEAKER_08]: to survive So there is there is no way
back and because cannabis is so limited We
[SPEAKER_08]: have to tell stories and in the stories we
have to avoid Everything by cannabis is
[SPEAKER_08]: stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_08]: So and and influencers know how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are professionals in that so if you
need a product to be promoted legally And
[SPEAKER_08]: with a nice story asking professional
influencer to do that It's a direct
[SPEAKER_05]: question I guess how often do you find
yourself shadow banned and when that
[SPEAKER_05]: happens?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you deal with this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you make sure it doesn't happen in
the first place?
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, I have more problems that a lot
of my customers are shadow banned I'm kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of experienced.
[SPEAKER_08]: I I I know what what I can do in social
media and whatnot, but my customers they
[SPEAKER_08]: are not as experienced as I am And for
example on Instagram, I had three
[SPEAKER_08]: customers being shadow banned within the
last three months Then I can of course not
[SPEAKER_08]: fool through my contract I have with them
So I also say if you are my customer You
[SPEAKER_08]: also have to care about your own shadow
bands and how you act on social media as a
[SPEAKER_08]: company because if you Spend money and
influencing and your own account is shadow
[SPEAKER_08]: banned the influencer cannot do anything
and this is very tricky.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is not a lot of People think
because they have a private Instagram
[SPEAKER_08]: which is prior running quite well Okay,
I do my I do my business Instagram myself
[SPEAKER_08]: and no you have to this is a real
professional job and even I employ people
[SPEAKER_08]: for my Instagram account and for my
Facebook account and for my YouTube
[SPEAKER_08]: account because it's a very very
complicated and and and it takes it's
[SPEAKER_08]: complicated and takes a lot of time to run
it and you don't see it if you click on my
[SPEAKER_08]: account you don't see that but there's a
lot of work and money behind it and This
[SPEAKER_08]: is why Influencing is not so cheap as a
lot of people expect that not as easy as
[SPEAKER_05]: it looks obviously So we've got just less
than ten minutes left So I just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that we we get some questions
from the audience if there are so if you
[SPEAKER_05]: can put your hands up Anyone wants to ask
so this one here
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear for the panel You had a
question Hello, I'm coming from a legal
[SPEAKER_04]: background here when you plan or
brainstorm on advertising on social media
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you usually look at terms and
conditions of Facebook Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do they say on cannabis or CBD?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's that's something you always
need to look at As an influencer for me,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's hard to communicate with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also no strict rules or no real
rules about cannabis marketing because
[SPEAKER_08]: every county country has its own law So
Facebook YouTube matter and your Google
[SPEAKER_08]: they decided to make their own cannabis
rules Which they do not really communicate
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only about soft drugs you and I know
what I'm allowed to do and what I'm not
[SPEAKER_08]: allowed to do but I cannot look at look it
up in a book so I have to find a
[SPEAKER_08]: trial-and-error and meanwhile,
I I'm expert in the trial-and-error
[SPEAKER_08]: principle and I don't get I didn't get a
strike for I think One and a half years
[SPEAKER_08]: and I didn't get a shadow ban for I think
on Instagram for a year So but only
[SPEAKER_08]: because I'm experienced and there are even
words here not allowed to use you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's it's tricky so Trial-and-error
because the big companies don't do not
[SPEAKER_08]: communicate communicate about this topic
with the influencers They just don't
[SPEAKER_08]: communicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I even tried it with the manager who was
really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well connected to YouTube and even They
didn't could they didn't talk They didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: answer his request from a professional
YouTube manager.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have no idea there's a Dispensary in
Colorado that you're not allowed to do TV
[SPEAKER_07]: ads of your dispensary So they made TV ads
of the businesses next door to them around
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right like come and get a pedicure
It's right next door to the dispensary All
[SPEAKER_07]: right come and buy a sandwich from this
place it's right next door to the
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary So then that actually worked We
have a question over here Hi again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am grass at the founder of Cana Portugal
and I just want to To remind that when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to the marketing in the legal
industry We need to think that where we
[SPEAKER_00]: are is one of the biggest ways to promote
Cannabis in the legal Industry because we
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to forget that forums conferences
Expos fairs and so on And this is not fair
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are all together and we are
sharing our histories and we are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: such a good job Giving this huge
contribution for the marketing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal industry So I dare to ask a big
applause to Alex Rogers who has done such
[SPEAKER_00]: a good a great job doing this marketing
And helping all of us Improving our
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go I'm Max Kobe with abstracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Michael and panel for sharing
your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to be here My question it for
you guys is we're constantly challenged
[SPEAKER_01]: with the shifting rules on Instagram and
things and so we think Adding,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know stars in between can are not
spelling it correctly might help us I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just wondering if you could grace us with
maybe your top Three tips to avoid getting
[SPEAKER_08]: shadow band Do you want to disclose that
information we can Try try to avoid the
[SPEAKER_08]: the word cannabis try to avoid consumption
in front of camera and try to avoid
[SPEAKER_08]: anything that might be seen as that it's
Addressed to minors or children anything
[SPEAKER_08]: even the pet or something in the picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those three things I noticed on my
Count that if I post a silly cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: meme, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll they'll send it out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I post a picture of Cannabis and
say I got this from these people then
[SPEAKER_07]: they're like, hey You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to find a way to be Roundabout
you can't just be like come buy the shit
[SPEAKER_03]: over here and humor humor Yeah,
so we we reach over like two minutes
[SPEAKER_03]: million people every month and we have
consumption and camera and we use the word
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and What was the other thing you
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we do all those three.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure Yeah, but but yeah what what we
do also is we tag our content as
[SPEAKER_03]: educational cannabis content and we ensure
that it is educational we also Like target
[SPEAKER_03]: for over 18 before it's published.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't let YouTube to do the work for us
because then you get like revised which is
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who I'm looking who made the
question like And then We also ensure that
[SPEAKER_03]: as Michael notice also is not focused on
the product or the cannabis Specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: so that the content is not like a
promotional content for that But it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: story or it's around something that
congregates you and this is also Very
[SPEAKER_03]: important because it generates way more
engagement with your community when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: actually giving something that helps
whether it's a tip for how to grow your
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis or a tutorial and how to use a
vaporizer or how to Roll a joint or any of
[SPEAKER_03]: those things something that provides a
useful tool for our community It's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: go a long way because we don't have any
tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any resources That's what's
some what's common in our communities that
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have the information education.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no universities There's no a lot
of authorized sources to get information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Every oh nice someone brought a dog
Good for you, though I will answer in
[SPEAKER_03]: barking no, but yet using these elements
providing useful tools providing
[SPEAKER_03]: educational assets for the community would
generate a deeper engagement and you will
[SPEAKER_03]: know and find out by yourselves that the
how deep is this gap of Knowledge that we
[SPEAKER_03]: are we're missing and we're eagering as a
community You didn't like my answer I
[SPEAKER_02]: loved your answer and I agree totally with
that But I would like to add something and
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be right Poetry like he said
Poetry, I think it's something and let
[SPEAKER_02]: people feel Feel what you have to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's one of the things to do on
Instagram or Facebook Chicago Are you guys
[SPEAKER_06]: talking to chatbots AI chatbots right now
number one and number two?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is gonna happen with their AI
influence?
[SPEAKER_06]: On your work in terms of marketing of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say the next two to five years
Someone that sounds like one for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good question We didn't
speak about AI, but it's it's a major
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I'm sure we've all aware of what
it can do for us in so many aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an AI for everything now
generating SEO What's the word optimized?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry SEO optimized a text for cannabis
without using the word cannabis could be
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing But I can speak about our
experiences company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as like the first GPT came out
I Hired someone to actually Train our
[SPEAKER_03]: staff in AI so we're using it on daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually use to create video that has
cannabis backgrounds self-generating or
[SPEAKER_03]: so, so we are using it now and it can be
very helpful to Avoid mistakes when
[SPEAKER_03]: creating content for for starters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that answers the question
that you did Will it ever write poetry
[SPEAKER_03]: though is the question what will it ever
write poetry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked like I'm I'm a writer myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I I try to do some poetry in GPT and
still sucks I'm sure it's gonna get
[SPEAKER_03]: better, but it's really bad poetry so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So You're safe Me not so much No,
but as long as we use it in in in creative
[SPEAKER_03]: way I think it can be can be a lot of help
We are using it right now when we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: few shows that you can see how we use it
It's not the the content.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's a tool, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Check high as hell in Spain Barcelona is
very nice.
