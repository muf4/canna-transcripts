[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me kick it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you weren't here earlier,
I'm David Traylor, Senior Managing
[SPEAKER_06]: Director of Golden Eagle Partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a lead sponsor here because we're a
lead sponsor at Benzinga in Miami,
[SPEAKER_06]: CanMed earlier, just to make sure
everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the first investment bank in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: to do cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing it over seven years
internationally, and I have 15 years
[SPEAKER_06]: operational experience, two undergrad
degrees in science, three U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: patents, and certainly we've had cannabis
clients on six of the seven continents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, David.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've been in the cannabis industry for
eight years, focused in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a managing director at a private
equity fund called MacArthur Capital.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were involved in different M&A for the
past eight years.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen the highs and the lows,
and it's a very intriguing market to now
[SPEAKER_09]: be in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are headquartered in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a vertically integrated
pharmaceutical cannabis company that
[SPEAKER_09]: primarily focuses on genetics and
manufacturing as well as trading.
[SPEAKER_09]: So import, export.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started distributing medical cannabis to
patients 27 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was the first medical cannabis
distributor in Canada just after the
[SPEAKER_03]: operations in California started.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started delivering cannabis with a
bicycle and a pager and a backpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was even before the days of flip
phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We essentially built a movement in Canada
focused on patient advocacy, physician
[SPEAKER_03]: education, working with our regulators,
working with the public, and transformed
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada's perception of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We dragged our government kicking and
screaming through the courts until we
[SPEAKER_03]: created a federal framework for medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the first 12 large licenses were
given out, I moved from my civilly
[SPEAKER_03]: disobedient activist queen of the rebels
role and started working in the corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started working with Bedrocan and
eventually became the first female member
[SPEAKER_03]: of the C-suite of Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Canopy Growth has since somewhat
gone through a bit of a decline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have lived through the revolution and
the legalization and the ups and downs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and now Canada's very much in a market
recovery place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to sharing some
insights about that experience with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis Koski.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been involved in the cannabis
industry since roughly 2009, full-time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did some work in it prior to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost entirely on the government side
of the equation, so I bring that
[SPEAKER_05]: government perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably most notably, I was the director
of the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[SPEAKER_05]: Division in 2013, going into 2014 when we
first legalized cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was largely responsible for leading
the teams that drafted the first several
[SPEAKER_05]: rounds of regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was also a subject matter expert to our
legislatures, to the state legislature,
[SPEAKER_05]: where we kind of reported how we were
progressing with our implementation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since that time, I have had a small
consulting firm that had me traveling
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and Canada, sometimes here in Europe,
and the Caribbean, helping governments
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of grapple with more permissive
cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They helped design that for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I started with Metric,
which is a leading seed-to-sale tracking
[SPEAKER_05]: software company that contracts with 23
different government agencies to provide
[SPEAKER_05]: track and trade services for government
and industry to create transparent supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Steve Winokur.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm based in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_07]: I work at Canaccord Genuity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a managing director of the investment
banking group.
[SPEAKER_07]: Canaccord is a medium-sized global
investment bank.
[SPEAKER_07]: I lead the cannabis practice globally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started raising money for Canadian
cannabis companies in 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2019, I started raising money for U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since then, our practice has raised about
$7 billion for cannabis companies in North
[SPEAKER_07]: America, and we've advised on about $20
billion of M&A transactions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a pretty good track record.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of that happened prior to the last 12
months.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact, all of it happened
prior to the last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been quiet the last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you look at the title of this
section that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_06]: and if you're here when I kick things off
this morning, we're trying to look and
[SPEAKER_06]: change the nomenclature THC+, THC-,
otherwise known as marijuana versus hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly we can cover both of those,
not just the marijuana side as far as
[SPEAKER_06]: lessons learned from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think what we want to do is,
again, this is not a moderated panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to kick it off with one question,
and we'll go through that, and then we can
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly kick it to the audience to go to
questions to you guys, make it more
[SPEAKER_06]: interactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Peter, starting off, what do you think
are the three lessons learned,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, whether you want to talk of the
framework on the THC+, THC-, side,
[SPEAKER_06]: from when you learned the three things
from North America, whether it's Canada or
[SPEAKER_06]: the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, since we're going to open it up,
I'm going to keep it high level.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that being involved in
building a good regulatory platform is one
[SPEAKER_09]: of the best opportunities that a lot of
these global markets have.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that in the U.S.,
just in many states, absolutely,
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they did not support the
businesses that were building.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that the early stage valuation
of a lot of these companies were way too
[SPEAKER_09]: high.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that these companies were focusing
on what the potential market was,
[SPEAKER_09]: not understanding the dynamics of how the
product was ultimately going to get to the
[SPEAKER_09]: end user, whether it's a patient or a
consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So overbuilt platforms, overvalued
companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll stick with those two for now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hillary?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many minutes can I take?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want all three, all in one go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, not 30 minutes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so first of all, in Canada,
we legalized cannabis with a
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibitionist mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to sell legalization to the
conservative law and order parts of our
[SPEAKER_03]: government, we had to basically legalize
cannabis with the purpose to reduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: harms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: My government didn't go so far as to say,
let's actually, in the legislation,
[SPEAKER_03]: acknowledge the racist history of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's actually look at the policies that
America exported around the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's deal with correcting that from a
legislative perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened is the stigma that is
based in racism from 100 years of
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition carried through and permeates
our regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabis is still treated with way more
stigma than any other industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more highly regulated in many ways
than alcohol and tobacco are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's overtaxed, it's overregulated,
and my industry in Canada is being
[SPEAKER_03]: strangled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent my entire adult life working to
create a regulatory framework for medical
[SPEAKER_03]: and recreational cannabis in Canada,
and currently, the industry is pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: devastated in Canada because of the stigma
that permeates the regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Europe, I'm not hearing any
conversations about unpacking the history
[SPEAKER_03]: of prohibition and ensuring that we
actually create legislation that addresses
[SPEAKER_03]: the history so that we're not
overregulating, overtaxing, and basically
[SPEAKER_03]: killing the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the second issue is what I'm seeing in
North America and starting to see around
[SPEAKER_03]: the world is that we're treating cannabis
and cannabis companies like any other CPG
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is not a product that you simply
manufacture and sell to a consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving cannabis from an unregulated market
into a regulated market is a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: social shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am no longer really seeing companies
invest in patient education, some
[SPEAKER_03]: physician education still, ensuring that
companies are actually diverse,
[SPEAKER_03]: ensuring that there's actually community
impact, social justice work, all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces that actually make your employers,
your employees, your consumers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and your regulators actually have loyalty
to you and your company.
That's number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the third piece, let me check my
glasses, is again, you talked about fair
[SPEAKER_03]: valuations, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanna talk a little bit about market
projections.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my government projected that the
recreational and medical cannabis market
[SPEAKER_03]: was gonna be about 12 billion,
and it's actually four.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's much, much, much smaller than what
was predicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Companies we were over-invested in,
investment was falling out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: My previous company took in $5 billion
from Constellation Brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pace of scaling was absolutely
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So over-investment, over-capacity build,
and now we have millions of grams of
[SPEAKER_03]: unsold cannabis in the market because
everything just grew absolutely way too
[SPEAKER_03]: fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The survivors, the people who are actually
starting to be profitable, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're specializing, they're smaller,
they're keeping their overhead lower,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're actually able to pivot quickly
to meet the needs of the patients and the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Louis?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's three.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm that structured on
mine, but the one thing I'm taking away
[SPEAKER_05]: from what I've heard so far and kinda like
speaks to our thinking on this is that
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization of cannabis is one hell of a
balancing act.
[SPEAKER_05]: On one hand, I think the governance of
legalization is really important,
[SPEAKER_05]: but having too little governance or too
little government interaction isn't great,
[SPEAKER_05]: but having too much government action can
tend to be pretty stifling, can take away
[SPEAKER_05]: from how big the market can be and how
effective businesses are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you think of it in terms of a
balancing act, one thing that's important
[SPEAKER_05]: is having government engaged in a way that
is actually supportive of the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think to a large extent what Hillary
was saying is spot on in that we tend to
[SPEAKER_05]: think of this as bringing an illicit
market into a regulated market,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we have to be really heavy-handed with
the regulation, when in reality what's
[SPEAKER_05]: really important is once the decision is
made to legalize cannabis, is for
[SPEAKER_05]: government to actually really engage and
collaborate with the industry to come up
[SPEAKER_05]: with the right regulations, because part
of the balancing act is finding
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations that really genuinely help
protect public health in a way that the
[SPEAKER_05]: illicit market doesn't, but also try and
right-size those to where investment is
[SPEAKER_05]: possible and that it's possible for
businesses to grow, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really hard for a lot of people to really
get their head wrapped around an industry
[SPEAKER_05]: that should be designed in such a way
where the businesses can actually be
[SPEAKER_05]: successful, and so I think that's really
important, and then when you have the
[SPEAKER_05]: government right-sizing the regulations
for business, then businesses are actually
[SPEAKER_05]: more likely to be super supportive of
government, so instead of the normal
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory dynamic where there's this
adversarial relationship between the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulator and the regulated community,
you can actually tend to partner a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit more and collaborate a little bit more
in a way where products can be safer,
[SPEAKER_05]: but businesses can be successful,
and then I think the third lesson that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've learned on the positive side is that
once you have that partnership built up
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have some trust between those two
entities, then it makes it a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_05]: create the transparency that's necessary
for government to be able to efficiently
[SPEAKER_05]: oversee what's happening in the industry
without, again, continually burdening the
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses with reporting requirements and
other super-complicated testing regimes
[SPEAKER_05]: and labeling products, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really start to balance that in a
way that is beneficial both, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: to public health and safety, but
sustainability of the businesses over the
[SPEAKER_05]: long haul.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, so I think it's over-regulation and
under-regulation happening at the same
[SPEAKER_07]: time in the same market, which has been
the curse of Canadian and U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses, and I'll give you a couple of
examples.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in Canada, at the peak, there were
1,200, I think, 1,200 actual license
[SPEAKER_07]: producers in Canada, 1,200 for a market
size of $4 billion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody who paid five, in the province
where I'm from, Ontario, anyone who paid
[SPEAKER_07]: $5,000 could open a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the peak, there were, I think,
1,400 dispensaries in the province of
[SPEAKER_07]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's eight million people in that
province.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the largest dispensary networks in
the country is a company called Fire and
[SPEAKER_07]: Flower, declared bankruptcy a couple of
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest dispensary network in Canada,
a company called Hightide, I think they do
[SPEAKER_07]: about half a billion dollars a year in
revenue, and they have yet to make a
[SPEAKER_07]: profit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, on the one hand, there's an
under-regulation in the government in that
[SPEAKER_07]: instance.
[SPEAKER_07]: The over-regulation, I would point to
taxes, particularly in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, the effective tax rate,
marginal tax rate, for a U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: license producer, a U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: multi-state operator, is about 78,
76%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do you have a business that does a
billion-two in revenue and 40% EBITDA
[SPEAKER_07]: margins, but has zero free cash flow?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think until some of these institutions,
so that's the over-regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Canada, it's the same thing with excise
taxes, with transferring across
[SPEAKER_07]: provincial, inability to transfer across
provincial lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have an inability for the Canadian
license producers to make any money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of the $4 billion market, I think
there's only, the maximum market share
[SPEAKER_07]: that any one large license producer in
Canada has is 5%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was canopy for a little while.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have 1,200 license producers,
maximum market share is 5%.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 78% effective tax rate in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of both under-regulation and
over-regulation, it's impossible to make a
[SPEAKER_07]: commercial entity for any cannabis
producer in North America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I mentioned before, starting off,
I want to take this in two parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, talking about THC Plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I mentioned, I was in Davos in 2020
before the pandemic shut things down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Davos, I wanted to pull three
things that I thought we'd learned in
[SPEAKER_06]: North America and the US that were
applicable and going to be applicable to
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly, I think they still hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is there's been very little history of
first mover advantage in this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I mentioned, I was Chief Business
Officer at Serna.
[SPEAKER_06]: Serna was the biggest name in cannabis,
full stop in 2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody knows who they are now,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Timing, geographies always roll out,
not always.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty darn sure most of the time roll out
much slower than if you look at Spain,
[SPEAKER_06]: UK, Nevada actually rolled out quickly,
Colorado did.
[SPEAKER_06]: But very few times, look at Germany,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at Portugal, everything's been slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The third thing on the THC Plus side is
the fact, and you guys maybe remember
[SPEAKER_06]: hearing it earlier, biological supply
chains are inherently unstable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whether it's canopy growth,
Aurora, harvest, you name it, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the thing that's been an
advantage for us is having a biological,
[SPEAKER_06]: a biotech background.
[SPEAKER_06]: When all these operators were going from
40,000 square feet of growth to 400,000,
[SPEAKER_06]: we predicted that it was gonna blow up and
it did, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get to THC minus or what
otherwise known as hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with that part of the sector
was the fact that there was very low
[SPEAKER_06]: barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So especially you saw this in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a lot of people jumping in because
there's no real regulation or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing else like there was on the THC
Plus side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you, as a result, had a lot of
products that were low quality and that
[SPEAKER_06]: result in low barriers, low quality
resulted in a ton of noise in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a result, you had a lot of people,
patients buying CBD or whatever the
[SPEAKER_06]: product was, mainly CBD, and taking it and
it didn't work, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So then you have this mess of people
saying, hey, this is great stuff when it
[SPEAKER_06]: works for them and other people trying bad
products and it wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the three things we learned on
the hemp side of the THC minus.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Peter, did you have a comment?
[SPEAKER_09]: The net net is that the illicit market is
a competitor until this is properly
[SPEAKER_09]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you look at Oklahoma, which is sure it
is regulated, but it's under regulated and
[SPEAKER_09]: they have over 10,000 licenses.
[SPEAKER_09]: That supports the black market,
the illicit market, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just think it's important when you
think about regulation, too much,
[SPEAKER_09]: too little.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with what the entire panelists
have said on that topic.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Guy?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: First question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the panel so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you all make good points.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some of the challenge with
cannabis is that, yep, is that regulators
[SPEAKER_08]: want to treat it like it's yellow cake
uranium and not just a weed plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they tend to go overboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I think one of the challenges,
too, is cannabis has been maybe the most
[SPEAKER_08]: successful decentralized business in the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of prohibition, nobody ever wanted
to get too big because that's when the
[SPEAKER_08]: government will come after you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there were a lot of small farmers
who were making a good wage and making
[SPEAKER_08]: good money and able to pay their tremors
and able to go to Thailand in the winter
[SPEAKER_08]: after the harvest was done.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we see in these forums and in all
this investment, everybody wants to
[SPEAKER_08]: monopolize.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody wants to have 30% of the market
share.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that people are really
overestimating, maybe perhaps,
[SPEAKER_08]: or just in their desire to be super
capitalistic are missing out on how the
[SPEAKER_08]: actual, the consumers and the business and
the things work.
[SPEAKER_08]: You understand what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I build on that quickly?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're about to take a question from
the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that it's all of our
collective responsibility to build this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and to build the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear a lot of projections.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard some crazy numbers last night
about how big the German patient market is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be in a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hear anybody talking about the
investments that they're making that are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to support the whole space and not
just support their one company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm curious of all of the people
that are here that are interested in the
[SPEAKER_03]: European market.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you have contributed to the
European Medical Cannabis Association?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you are supporting the
industry associations that are doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: work on behalf of the entire industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that I haven't heard a lot
about is about patient affordability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to grow a medical market
and you're actually dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: critically and chronically ill patients,
you're dealing with some of the less
[SPEAKER_03]: privileged people in your population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hear a lot about market share and I
hear a lot about margins, but I don't hear
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot about actually creating distribution
structures and supply chains that are
[SPEAKER_03]: actually making the product affordable for
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's going to grow your
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for a great perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious, are there particular
markets in the United States that you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: think have done a better job at avoiding
some of the pitfalls you've discussed,
[SPEAKER_04]: such as high taxes and a persistent
illicit market?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can think of a few, but I'm curious if
there's any that have caught your
[SPEAKER_04]: attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I'm curious if you have a take
on what can be done to ensure that these
[SPEAKER_04]: policy lessons are learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's the perception in the
United States that we fail to learn from
[SPEAKER_04]: our prior mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm curious if you guys agree,
and if you have a reason as to why that
[SPEAKER_04]: happens and how it can be addressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon grows great weed and it's very
cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not maybe so much for the farmers now
because they don't get the prices they
[SPEAKER_08]: used to.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in terms of getting rid of the illicit
market, when you can buy a half a kilo of
[SPEAKER_08]: very good Oregon cannabis for 50 euro,
40 euro or whatever, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their prices are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think they've done a pretty good job
with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me started about Washington or
California, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got problems with those people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I do want to say Oregon had the
largest price compression in U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: history.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was a very difficult market for the
farmers to survive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, my favorite market is Missouri.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are on a state level.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can write off 280E, obviously not on a
federal level.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a major topic that everyone is
talking about in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to see states override federal law or
tax structures is progress.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's progress that the states have to take
and drive forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: They also have just generally the lowest
tax bracket in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Missouri is my favorite market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it, Hirsch, it depends on what
you're... Poor, I think, Benedict or maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: it was...
[SPEAKER_06]: Constantine said your definition is
success.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for example, Oklahoma, I mean,
come on, talk about success.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a medical market, $800 million second
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of that's going to Dallas,
Texas, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been very vibrant, I would think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Lewis, with you on stage,
I think Colorado definitely did a pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: good job being the first rollout state,
although they kind of screwed things up on
[SPEAKER_06]: the public side.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know, Lewis, you'd have a
better perspective on that than me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so since we contract with 22
different states in the U.S., I'm a little
[SPEAKER_05]: reluctant to start calling out the ones
that are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I've got a lot invested into
Colorado's market because that's where I
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of got my start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I think there was a lot of
things that went really well in Colorado
[SPEAKER_05]: to begin with, that I think kind of served
as a launch pad for other states to kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of follow suit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's some pluses and minuses to
a lot of different approaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mentioned earlier about the
importance of governance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think where we've seen the most success
is when government is proactive in taking
[SPEAKER_05]: some level of charge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you think about the differences
between Washington and Oregon and
[SPEAKER_05]: California and Massachusetts and Colorado
and Michigan, they've all kind of taken
[SPEAKER_05]: different approaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at different times in the history,
they've been more or less proactive in how
[SPEAKER_05]: they're acting as a government.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we've seen where government is
either being apathetic and not doing
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen the growth of illicit markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a lot of criminal activity,
and we've just seen a lot of uncertainty
[SPEAKER_05]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas on the opposite end of the
spectrum, where government has been more
[SPEAKER_05]: proactive in collaborating and partnering
with industry, we've seen much more
[SPEAKER_05]: positive results in terms of the
perception that people have about the
[SPEAKER_05]: credibility of the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: The capitalist pig answered this question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the limited license vertical
markets because it's the one that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: get significant amount of market share.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can manage your margins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the extent you can do something
with your profitability given the tax
[SPEAKER_07]: regime, those are the markets that you can
have the most impact.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask you a question though?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because sometimes, and I understand the
vertical market idea, but a lot of times
[SPEAKER_08]: you try the cannabis from those cats and
it just tastes like commercial pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you have to get it out in eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you don't have time.
[SPEAKER_08]: In California now, it's hard to find a
good 12 weeks of Tiva in the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_08]: and some of the really nice old school
strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is grown so fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is cured so quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything has to be gotten out right
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel some of the challenges with a
vertical approach as opposed to maybe a
[SPEAKER_08]: crafter or a smaller approach is that you
don't get the quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean Budweiser is cool, but I like a
craft beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no other answer beyond saying you
might be right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The quality might suffer.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I'm looking at it through the
prism of the capital markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from that perspective, maybe the
quality isn't as good as oftentimes as a
[SPEAKER_07]: craft grower or a more wide open market,
but you can make more money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also to add to that, Steve,
the one thing that's important too is not
[SPEAKER_06]: being in a limited license state versus
limited license state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been talking forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in Colorado or California,
I'll put those operators against anybody
[SPEAKER_06]: any day.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can win in the crucible competition
in Colorado, you're gonna be.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Trenton Burch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to know what the sort of
narrative or view is in the states at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment in terms of, I think we often
forget, and I appreciate this as an
[SPEAKER_00]: investment forum where returns are the
most important sort of conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we've also lost focus on what
cannabis and hemp can do for our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a medical perspective, from a
sustainability perspective, investing in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry is good for business and
it's good for the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we've raced so far forward
at such rapid speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this happen over
capitalization, especially on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have lost money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there any narrative in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment around people investing in
this industry because it's good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: human race and actually surviving?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a good narrative in terms of
sustainability is definitely a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: money can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are just in it to make money,
that's also fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have we lost our way in terms of the
importance of cannabis and hemp for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future of our planet?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an answer about whether
people are investing in cannabis for those
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to raise that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me personally, working to free
cannabis from the chains of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_03]: a huge part of it is about the potential
that cannabis has to actually address
[SPEAKER_03]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of sustainability,
I'm curious how many of you, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_03]: show me a raise of hands, know about the
legislation that the EU enacted into law
[SPEAKER_03]: in April that is the corporate
sustainability reporting standards that
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to impact cannabis companies
operating in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so a few of you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really something that's
important to look around the corner and
[SPEAKER_03]: see what is coming because for publicly
traded companies, the reporting is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to start at the beginning of next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for small and medium-sized
enterprises, you have about two years to
[SPEAKER_03]: get ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many of you are familiar with what
scope one, two, and three is when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to your environmental impact disclosures?
[SPEAKER_03]: So scope one and scope two is about
measuring and reporting on your own
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also waste and water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But scope three, which the EU is going to
be requiring, is actually about reporting
[SPEAKER_03]: on the environmental footprint of your
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that's incredibly
important to start preparing for because
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're not building your companies with
the data systems and the expertise to be
[SPEAKER_03]: tracking all of this information,
if you're not building your supply chain
[SPEAKER_03]: and thinking about partnering with people
who are going to have the capacity to give
[SPEAKER_03]: you their reports on their emissions,
you're really going to hit a brick wall
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's going to become very expensive to
be able to address it in short order.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really actually an amazing thing
that the EU has done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most, I would say, aggressive but
positive reporting standards that have
[SPEAKER_03]: been implemented around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will affect the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really passionate about this and
happy to talk with anybody who wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a little bit of an understanding about
what's coming and how to start addressing
[SPEAKER_03]: it because the more mature your company
becomes and the more complex, it becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: exponentially more expensive to be able to
address this when the requirements are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be hitting you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trenton, that was a great question and I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I would just mention,
your question took me back to the early
[SPEAKER_05]: days, 2013, 2014, when we were first
putting the regulations together.
[SPEAKER_05]: The narrative then was more about how do
we keep the federal government from
[SPEAKER_05]: preempting this opportunity to start
legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think we were thinking about a
lot of, as much as we should have,
[SPEAKER_05]: the social justice issues or the
sustainability issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were thinking more like how do we
package this product in a way where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really obvious it's cannabis and how much
testing are we going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't necessarily thinking about
those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's like a growing interest in
certainly addressing a lot of the social
[SPEAKER_05]: inequity issues that are really prominent
in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think sustainability is
becoming more and more important to
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even like the regulators are starting
to like backtrack and say, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: how much packaging do we really need on a
smokable cannabis that is not a danger in
[SPEAKER_05]: its current form to anyone, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Even kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's not until it's decarboxylated
that it becomes like an active ingredient
[SPEAKER_05]: that's more of a public health interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing I would say too is like
part of like creating the digital
[SPEAKER_05]: transparent supply chains in the US,
it's created the opportunity to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: start to report on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So industry itself is thinking like,
how do we start to really frame what our
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon footprint is or what our
environmental footprint is on the earth
[SPEAKER_05]: and like start coming up with ways or like
including reporting on that, like what
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals are used, what pesticides are
used, how much water is being used for
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigation or how much energy is being
consumed to produce the product and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually be able to report on that in a
way that most other industries are not
[SPEAKER_05]: doing or even really willing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think even though I think it's
kind of like still in its infancy,
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry itself, just like it's
wanting to prove itself credible from the
[SPEAKER_05]: get-go, is also interested in like raising
the bar on sustainability and being able
[SPEAKER_05]: to report in ways other industries are
just not interested in doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, real quick, so Trenton, you and I
know each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing, the question you're posing
is really good, but it's funny because
[SPEAKER_06]: we're so far from what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, right now we talk to somebody
later on the panel here is going around
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to find money for investment and
there's a lot of investors saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, sorry, we're not touching cannabis
because we saw the shit show that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: happened over the last 10 years where good
money's gone into bad companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have the fact that to Louis'
point, I worked at Cerna.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cerna was essentially making indoor
climate control systems for indoor grow
[SPEAKER_06]: ops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indoor grow cannabis right now,
THC plus, is not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's indoor grow, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a sustainable.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're putting as much, it's like a data
room where you're putting in a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: energy and having to take it back out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's a good point, but we're very
far from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name's Oliver Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the CEO of Takoon USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a multi-state brand focused on the
medical consumer segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And David, going off of kind of what you
just said, I think a lot of investor
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations have been out of whack in the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that they're more congruent
with reality today?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that the company
valuations reflect that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think in the past year in
Europe, we've seen companies come to that
[SPEAKER_09]: realization.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen valuations throughout Europe
come down anywhere from 40 to 60% in the
last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the last 12 months, so yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what happens in markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I was doing biotech in 2008,
when everything went sideways,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know biotech, phase three companies
are worth more than phase two companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: which were more than phase one and
pre-clinical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was so out of whack in 2008
that you had phase three companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: phase two and phase one companies,
worth pretty much the same amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things happen like this, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the way the world works.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what's done us a good job,
is that we've been through biotech.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know things whipsaw back and forth,
and we knew this was gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be around for another six months,
12 months.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you survive this and you can come
out the other side, that's when your
[SPEAKER_06]: value's gonna matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie?
[SPEAKER_08]: No pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to put any pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, speaking for all women,
could you tell us how... Let's go to
[SPEAKER_08]: lunch, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have lunch provided for you outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
