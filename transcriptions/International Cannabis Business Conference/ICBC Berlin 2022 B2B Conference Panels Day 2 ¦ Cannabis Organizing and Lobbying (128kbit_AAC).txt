[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm really looking forward to
this conversation, actually, and to kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of ground everybody and where everyone is
coming from before we tell you what our
[SPEAKER_04]: backgrounds are and where we're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like a show of hands, how many people
are actually making a living from cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sort of revenue or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people are kind of like just
activists or, oh, very few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, so we're mostly from west
coast of North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Vancouver, British Columbia,
where I helped dispensaries get licensed
[SPEAKER_04]: there before legalization and then have
been kind of slowly changing certain laws
[SPEAKER_04]: and licensing classes and things like that
since legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people from California,
from Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it kind of the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, their bios are very
impressive and they are in the program.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd like to just kind of start off by
saying, you know, who are you advocating
[SPEAKER_04]: for and what are you advocating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Luna Stower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with iAspire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who am I advocating for?
[SPEAKER_02]: The people and the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, access,
purity, wellness, this is all what we come
[SPEAKER_02]: here for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is so much bigger than just the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we're seeing a lot of darkness in
the world right now, we really believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant medicine is our pathway to
higher consciousness and a higher way of
[SPEAKER_02]: living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just about the buzz or the
medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is about liberation and
sovereignty and autonomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, the human rights
issue that we're fighting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Bridget Hennessy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Weed Maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who we are fighting for and what we
really dive into is making sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have an open, diverse, and transparent
cannabis economy around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really leaned into that and made
sure that we are fighting for that every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who are not familiar with
Weed Maps, I should just quickly say we
[SPEAKER_00]: are a tech company in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't directly touch the plant,
but we are here to power the industry with
[SPEAKER_00]: and give the industry tools to perform as
efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Matt Cuman.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an attorney.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the cannabis space since the
late 1990s in the Bay Area is where I
[SPEAKER_05]: started.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an office in New York recently
opened.
[SPEAKER_05]: My advocacy changed over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Initially, I was advocating for medical
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were suing governments for,
you know, discriminating against patients
[SPEAKER_05]: in California, federal governments who
state state, county cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I got very involved in political
action committee in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: We advocated for cultivators up in the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were bringing them together and formed
a political action committee in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_05]: County and other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought the pack down to Los Angeles
and essentially trying to organize the
[SPEAKER_05]: business community that was going to be
affected by the changing laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so all along the way, we've been,
you know, the advocacy is changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, ultimately, the advocacy is
really about fixing the broken laws that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've seen, you know, Canada and
California and many other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Dominic's going to talk about that
a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just trying to fix the broken
laws so that we can really make sure that
[SPEAKER_05]: there is even more access, free,
unhindered access to cannabis throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, I think, the next big,
big advocacy for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dmitry Downing, I'm an ex-prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got involved in the industry in 2012 in
a sort of general counsel role for my
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers and my dad's dispensaries in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2012, 2015, I studied cannabis
regulations, licensing, market structures,
[SPEAKER_03]: came to some conclusions, which I found
out later through my work with normal or
[SPEAKER_03]: the wrong conclusions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got my head on straight, started the
marijuana association of Arizona,
[SPEAKER_03]: which became known as one of the best ones
in the state interest state siloed markets
[SPEAKER_03]: of the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we evolved it into Marijuana Industry
Trade Association USA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been developing that over the
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, we do a lot of different
things, advocacy, education, business
[SPEAKER_03]: networking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I can leave you with one thing,
we have to fight as an industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a future members of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Participants in industry, employees of the
industry fight the concept of limited
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing, because that is an economic
abomination that we have inherited through
[SPEAKER_03]: the good work of MPP, but inadvertently
not understanding economics and market
[SPEAKER_03]: structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they probably understood that,
but just to appease those who hate
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, limited licensing was created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for most people that I have met in the
industry, it's just not a physical
[SPEAKER_03]: favorable result, and it's definitely not
a favorable result for the patients and
[SPEAKER_03]: the consumers, but we can talk more about
that as we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to meet you down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and to meet you raises the point
that I was referring to a couple of years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago at an ICPC conference with George
Worth and Burkhart Blighart on the stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that lobbying for cannabis
regulations with politicians was like
[SPEAKER_04]: playing chess with the pigeon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't really matter who wins,
they're still gonna knock over all the
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces of shit all over the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: People took that as a little more
pessimistic, I think, but it was very
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting our conversation backstage
where we've all kind of talked about,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've seen such amazing progress in our
lifetimes, and so many more people have
[SPEAKER_04]: access, although we've also seen things
drop, like in BC, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there used to be better access
for a lot of patients, particularly the
[SPEAKER_04]: poor patients, when things were still
illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that we've gotten to realization,
those things have gone backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what are some of the other things
that you see that have been frustrating
[SPEAKER_04]: and what kind of keeps you motivated to
stay positive and keep moving?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say a lot of the
frustrations for us definitely comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: not having pathways for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not really a conversation
anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's recreational now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to pass a Senate Bill 34 just to be
able to do what we were doing before,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is getting to ill people,
patients, veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, that's a huge part of
what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: ICE Fire works in the hardware space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much like weed maps, we don't touch the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just do the hardware for the vape
industry so we can really be able to put
[SPEAKER_02]: our resources and our energy and our
advocacy behind certain things that other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis companies cannot, because they,
you know, all the limitations that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have around making, advertising,
cash flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been a really exciting thing to
be able to have an facility to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: come in and show up for the, you know,
the consciousness raising side,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lobbying side, the organizing side,
because really there's no there's no PR
[SPEAKER_02]: group or PSA for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's really arguing in her voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either industry advocates or patients
who want low pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really what's best and what's in
the nature of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the thing that keeps me
the most happy, and we talked about this
[SPEAKER_02]: backstage too, is, you know, just the
networking, doing what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a radical act during a time of
pandemic to come out and be around other
[SPEAKER_02]: people and fight for medical autonomy and
advocacy during a time of medical fascism.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of ways, people are controlling
everything about our medical passports and
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have access to from food to
medicine and beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what keeps me feeling happy is seeing
that much like the way that the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: grows in, you know, an interconnected way
in its environment, we're doing that as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure that we're staying buoyant,
that we're connecting with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't compete if not us versus each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cooperation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's enough for all of us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that that's what gives me
hope is that despite the obvious tyranny
[SPEAKER_02]: of the government against people being as
autonomous and free as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still learning from this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still allowing it to open our hearts
and our minds and see that this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: like other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a consumer packaged goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just treat this like alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a magical, mystical, medicinal plant
and you start acting like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that when I think about
it, I feel overall very optimistic because
[SPEAKER_00]: when we start seeing legalization take
place in new areas or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're starting down this path,
they are looking to the established
[SPEAKER_00]: markets and trying to understand where
some of the pitfalls are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the biggest mistakes we've
seen in some of the early movers was
[SPEAKER_00]: really not bringing the legacy market to
the table and having their voice heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bunch of people that were trying
to learn about the plant or learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization from a very business setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're doing a better job
and I'm very hopeful that we'll continue
[SPEAKER_00]: down this path of the legacy market as an
afterthought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't establish a market and establish
regulations and policy and then think
[SPEAKER_00]: later like, oh, we should probably talk to
the people that have been in this for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years in the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be having them at the table from
the outset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're seeing states like New
York that actually got that and understood
[SPEAKER_00]: it and are going to implement a law that
is just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think overall it's hopeful,
it's slow, but hopeful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're going to get there and
it's just going to take time.
And hats off to Weedmaps.
They put their money where their mouth is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that dovetails into one of the trends
that I've seen in terms of success.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's businesses that integrate the
advocacy that is still necessary in order
[SPEAKER_05]: to make this not only politically and
socially and culturally acceptable and get
[SPEAKER_05]: rid of stigma, but also to help create
your own markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you bring legacy people in and
marry them correctly with your finance
[SPEAKER_05]: people, your MBAs, and you develop a
working team, then I think you actually
[SPEAKER_05]: have massive success.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, as a side note to that,
I went to a seminar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't about cannabis, but it was about
someone was tracking publicly traded
[SPEAKER_05]: companies that had big budgets for
lobbying and political work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those companies actually did better
from a profit standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, if you're a company and you
think, well, advocacy is an afterthought
[SPEAKER_05]: or we're not going to spend money on
advocacy, it's a mistake because you
[SPEAKER_05]: actually will help create your markets and
you'll build, not only build your markets
[SPEAKER_05]: and open your markets, but you'll also be
able to help deploy larger political and
[SPEAKER_05]: social cultural goals that we're trying to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and be a one trick
pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm incredibly, the world is
upside down from where it was back in
[SPEAKER_03]: Arizona and California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of patient access and consumer
access and choice that exists now as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to 15, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've always just wanted to stick to
the same basic point.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a trade organization, you know,
it's everyone from a butt tender with a
[SPEAKER_03]: dream to an owner with an exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to advance the rights of all
those people, every employee and their
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to one day be an owner themselves
and limited licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Barriers to entry prevent that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the biggest things
that's happening in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: that we as members of the cannabis
industry need to advocate against and
[SPEAKER_03]: educate against.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Germany hasn't set things up yet,
but you know, if there's one thing I can
[SPEAKER_03]: leave you with limited licensing means the
drug war 2.0 means prohibition 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have to be civil and criminal
sanctions in place to punish these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what the members of this
industry should want advocate for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not ultimately what's in the best
interest of executing their hopes and
[SPEAKER_03]: their dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not what's in the best interests
of creating competition, innovation and
[SPEAKER_03]: better products for patients and
consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, being the one trick pony,
I'm extremely optimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an ex-prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful, but there's a lot of work
to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And MediaUSA is here to help do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say something?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I graduated college a long time
ago.
I think I'm the old guy on the panel here.
You're a little behind me.
And I immediately went and became a labor
and community organizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the years, I fundamentally was
trained and fundamentally my passions are
[SPEAKER_05]: about organizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the years, I've just seen what
happens when people come together in a
[SPEAKER_05]: small room, have an idea, and then they
organize around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the cannabis space, one of the things
we did in 2009, the state of Maine came
[SPEAKER_05]: out with an ethical rule that said that
lawyers couldn't represent dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_05]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Maine Bar Association went
over to Arizona, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I flew to Phoenix and met with the
ACLU headquarters and a bunch of criminal
[SPEAKER_05]: defense lawyers I knew and immediately
started organizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we reached out to people in the
Arizona Bar Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: We organized like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arizona Bar Association wrote one of the
most brilliant ethics opinions that said
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyers should be allowed and it was
really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we organized, because we wrote
papers and we got law professors to help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is no question that you can
advocate and organize to the positive
[SPEAKER_05]: results.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does require you to sit down with
people you might have a disagreement with
[SPEAKER_05]: and work out how your strategy is going to
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's absolutely possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_05]: We organized black woodcutters who had no
money and power to change legislation in
[SPEAKER_05]: the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, anything's possible if you
organize.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically my message.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we've been seeing in Canada is
sort of the industry bifurcating a little
[SPEAKER_04]: into two camps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting, you know,
Demudri keeps bringing up the limited
[SPEAKER_04]: licensing issues that they're having in
states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a fundamental issue of how you
approach your competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, are they actually in competition
or are they on your same side in the long
[SPEAKER_04]: run?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you encourage that in an
industry that's filling up with people?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in Canada, in the last couple of
months, we've had some stores starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: advocate to go on arrest, shutting down
indigenous stores without any idea of what
[SPEAKER_04]: their sovereignty is like or, you know,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that while we've been
seeing that happen, large producers are
[SPEAKER_04]: getting away without even getting fines or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, we don't want to see
anybody go to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're going to have rules,
you should follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, indigenous stores fall under a
different category because we still
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't figured out exactly what that
sovereignty looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But how does that issue strike you?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you build those bridges?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do we just wait until they're all
pushed out, all the people that don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to work with anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think in my role at Bead Maps,
we've had to deal with this a lot because
[SPEAKER_00]: we were supportive of the legacy and
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been around for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when places like California started
moving to an adult use model and started
[SPEAKER_00]: to regulate, we had a really hard
conversations with our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to be open with the fact that,
you know, we are going to push for a very
[SPEAKER_00]: open market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you guys are going to feel
really uncomfortable with that because we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see everybody win here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see just five or 10
companies winning the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we often will be at odds with our
clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sort of unapologetic about it at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treat it very diplomatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will go in and have that hard
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll hear them out and hear their
point of view and try to explain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell you that the data is there to
say there's plenty of demand in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody's going to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we all have to work together with one
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have to start building trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the relationship building,
having honest conversations, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, you can get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a work in progress all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will lose some relationships over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to be okay and know that
you're heading the right direction the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And remember what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, government is the enemy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Government deserves the black market it
creates through its restrictions and
[SPEAKER_05]: through its limited licensing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's winning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're winning all the time because
whatever we can't organize well enough to
[SPEAKER_05]: create and get rid of these restrictions,
well, the consumers are going to go get
[SPEAKER_05]: their cannabis in the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to always be that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be that way in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been that way in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to continue to be that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we win.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant wins either way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was always telling my legacy to my
clients up in the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, you guys, you planted the seeds of
your own demise because the consumers saw
[SPEAKER_05]: that little green bud from California and
they went crazy around the world for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of what happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's on fire now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to your point about Northern
California, exploiting all of our cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something really interesting that I want
to mention, too, that makes sense in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe because of the appellation of
origin for wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice that you can't call
something champagne unless it's from the
[SPEAKER_02]: champagne region, Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that Frenchy Canoli,
the late great Hessian, who is no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: with us, but always was talking about the
terroir and the place, the spirit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, the air, the water, the genetics,
and the love that the people in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California put into it through
regenerative farming and the energetics of
[SPEAKER_02]: really working with a plant that they know
that they're making for medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: having decades and decades and generations
of people doing that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's something that can
really set folks apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just put Cali on a Mylar bag and
just call it Cali and have people believe
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's something that can
help us as far as cooperation goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: is really finding other people that have
the same message.
[SPEAKER_02]: At iSpy, what makes it simple is when we
do our dab bars, we always have a
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate sponsor that has a mission
that we relate to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always have another, DynaVap is another
partner that technically is a competitor,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're partners now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use each other's induction heating for
their DynaVapes or the dip device,
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be limiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're larger than the sum of our parts,
and I think that once we start seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: people come together and use common
language, that's the one thing I really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to say to the Europeans out here
trying to legislate and trying to move
[SPEAKER_02]: this forward, is talk to each other,
get on the same page.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of what happened with us in
California was we did a lot of sloppy
[SPEAKER_02]: infighting right in front of the
legislators, and it was really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allowed for Philip Morris and some of
these bigger players that know acreage
[SPEAKER_02]: caps came in and just decimated us because
they came in in their suits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really buttoned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really respectable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spoke the same language, and we look
like a bunch of wild, wacky hippies that
[SPEAKER_02]: were infighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's the biggest thing that
I've seen is utilizing trade organizations
[SPEAKER_02]: like Mita, talking to these people that
you think are your enemies, like Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: said.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people are on your side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having that hard conversation now is going
to save you a lot of pain from down the
[SPEAKER_02]: road when you're trying to undo some of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that knowing what you have,
knowing that what you grow, what you make
[SPEAKER_02]: is really special, and finding other
people that are in it for the long haul,
[SPEAKER_02]: not folks that are exit-focused,
that are just in here to make a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: buck, green-rush it, and bounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what we're here for,
so just be on the lookout for real family,
[SPEAKER_02]: and stick with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it gets a little
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it certainly did in Canada,
where it suddenly was the mining companies
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing around stocks and millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can get a little discouraging,
especially because then it makes it harder
[SPEAKER_04]: for the legitimate people to do money and
raises and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already starting to see that fade
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those companies can't keep running the way
they're running, not forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've gotten smaller license
classes and things like that, and people
[SPEAKER_04]: have had time to transition that maybe
weren't able to transition right away into
[SPEAKER_04]: the legal market, from the legacy market,
it does get better eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said something backstage that is
exactly the insult, the injury of telling
[SPEAKER_04]: the jurisdiction, this is what's going to
happen, and then watching them do it again
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets very frustrating to see that
happen again and again, but on the
[SPEAKER_04]: positive side, the more optimistic outlook
is that we do come through the other side
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to get there in the West
Coast, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are going to have issues again
when you get to federal legalization,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the more you try to appease a
bigger group of people, the worse things
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately get in the long run for the
people that know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dmitri, I noticed you've been taking
notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just taking notes for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm going to be a one trick pony.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do whatever you can to fight
limited licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates so many of the problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our friends turning each other in,
we know the ruthlessness in the games that
[SPEAKER_03]: are played.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes no economic sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an abomination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're opening up a nuclear power
plant, you can go get a license,
[SPEAKER_03]: you pay for it, and then if you break the
rules, they take away your permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Limited licensing, merit-based licensing,
deciding who has the right to retail,
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacture, dispense, grow, all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates a minority report reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that movie with Tom Cruise where
their government is trying to guess who's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do things right or who's going to
commit crimes?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless the MVP.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They inadvertently did this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have never attached
manufacturing and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had they had some sort of economic
theorist working with them, they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tragedy that we're repeating over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Countries like even Germany, I don't know
what's going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the lobbying situation
is and the special interest situation is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but people are looking at the United
States and say, how did they do it there?
[SPEAKER_03]: This devil exists that it's damaging all
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the legacy market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The legacy market, if there wasn't for
such restrictive, limited licensing,
[SPEAKER_03]: could get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure, they have to dot more I's and
cross more T's and follow more rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's impossible for them to even get
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: In social equity in Arizona, we have 4,000
people go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless Weedmaps for sponsoring us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to mention they sponsored that
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: 4,000 people get edgy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They self-identified as social equity
entrepreneurs that wanted to be involved
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're competing for 26 licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,500 were determined eligible through a
series of state determinations as to what
[SPEAKER_03]: social equity is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,500 paid $4,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: 26 of them got licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That means about 4,000 people that were
motivated to get off their ass and do
[SPEAKER_03]: something and push for their hopes and
their dreams and opportunity in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: is what cannabis should be about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just patients and consumers and
therapy and all that stuff, but also about
[SPEAKER_03]: a free market of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those are crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those were crushed because of the
concept of limited licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather see those 4,000 people go get a
piece of paper, screw things up,
[SPEAKER_03]: get their license revoked, fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what cannabis should be about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we keep here over and over again in
different countries and different states
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did Colorado do?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did that work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is limited licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This notion needs to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in Canada, we had barriers that
ended up being very similar to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that came about just from, oh,
you have to have this and this and this in
[SPEAKER_04]: the facility and you have to have this in
the facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because there were so many people
that were just saying, hey, we applied for
[SPEAKER_04]: a license, so we're now listed on a stock
market by our stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was so much of that that right when
we were allowing smaller producers in,
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Canada said, okay, you've got to
actually have a building first before
[SPEAKER_04]: we're even going to look at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then all of these smaller producers and
people that, you know, especially people
[SPEAKER_04]: from the former illicit market that didn't
know if they were going to get security
[SPEAKER_04]: cleared, couldn't necessarily build out
those facilities to that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to get a side tangent here,
because I've been using the word,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though it's a pet peeve of mine,
is I hate the word legacy market,
[SPEAKER_04]: because legacy is something you leave to
somebody when you're dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the black market hasn't gone anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still strong in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still strong in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thriving, actually going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, it's an interesting thing to
kind of watch happen, especially when the
[SPEAKER_04]: government's, you know, in Canada,
one of their main approaches was,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, we want to transition the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you only saw that in basically
BC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every other province wanted to turn and
wipe it out and replace it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I had a question in there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Bridget, you had brought up
before about how important it is to fight
[SPEAKER_04]: for equity and amnesty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of touches on some of these
barriers and artificial barriers that are
[SPEAKER_04]: being raised to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that we,
everybody says, you know, you'll hear it
[SPEAKER_00]: again and again in states or in different
jurisdictions that are legalizing and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll say, they're doing it to right
them wrong from the war on drugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not actually doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you look, California is a great
example of what not to do in this area
[SPEAKER_00]: because they did a lot of talking about
social equity and making sure that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was room in the market for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no clear definition in the
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was every jurisdiction gets to decide
how they're going to define it and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to give out those licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no access to capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to give people the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say, you know, the city of
Los Angeles, for instance, said you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the property in possession before
you can apply for a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they took two and a half years to
go through the first phase of licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: while people paid rent on that property.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does somebody who has zero to very
little capital even get in there and do
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been fighting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to call this out as often as
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do feel hopeful in places like New
York, where they're leading with the
[SPEAKER_00]: social equity licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still going to be a lot of room
for improvement and we have a fight ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're finally starting to think about
it the right way and think about not only
[SPEAKER_00]: do we give them licensing first,
but how do we help them build successful
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that can compete with the
well-capitalized, that can compete with
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies that have been around for
decades and they're multi-state operators
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're operating all over the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that there's room for
the mom and pop shops to be in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we need to continue to call
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think limited licensing on every level
is one of those problems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite frankly, you're just propping up
the illicit market by limiting on any
[SPEAKER_00]: level of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we need to continue to call
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that people are thinking through
that as a design policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are law school habits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that right stuff down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and again, countries like
Germany and the regulator stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that Germans do their own thing and
invent a market model and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, you know what, Colorado, you guys
screwed things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys didn't give enough people
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys left the legacy market out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys left social equity out by not
allowing for free market capitalism to
[SPEAKER_03]: triumph and for people to succeed or fail
based on their own merits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Access to capital is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other groups that have come up
with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I came up with that on my own,
but they come up with that on their own as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an easy way to solve the social
equity issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Less barriers to entry allow all the
social equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever wants to self-define a social
equity to participate and then create
[SPEAKER_03]: funds with the taxes that are generated so
that they can have access to capital to
[SPEAKER_03]: take on low interest like loans from SBA
type programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to help social equity status
individuals, and that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to have people go through a
merit-based process to determine that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're social equity eligible,
that's really tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess even in a capital, even in a loan
structure, they're going to have to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if I can say one thing,
let's kill limited licensing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that what you want in any ecosystem
is diversity?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and a couple of points.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote a short little piece for that
interesting little software, the HUVA.
Is that what they call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just on Dominic's saw here, which I agree
with completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing, just talking about
advocacy and how to do it maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're David took Goliath,
but David won.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're going to win this,
and it's going to be painful.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a lot of baton
passing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my two daughters are activists,
and I've got the baton handing over to
[SPEAKER_05]: them and a lot of young people that I
mentor and bring along.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of organizing tips out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we went up to Humble, the cannabis
farmers up there were terrified,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we actually brought them in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to the PTA meetings,
and they couldn't tell their teachers what
[SPEAKER_05]: they did for a living, the kids' teachers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought them in by creating a
stakeholder process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to the Rotary Club, and can we
have your monthly luncheon meeting be
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis up here and business people
in Humble County.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turned out we had allies everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have allies in so many places,
but they're afraid.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a little bit afraid because of the
stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you start to create forum,
or fora, whatever the plural is,
[SPEAKER_05]: for people to come into a room and start
talking and communicating, it's amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what happened up in Humble.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a 16-month campaign that we kicked
off at a Rotary Club meeting in October
[SPEAKER_05]: 2014 and by January of 2016, which was
really fast if you talk to political
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had an ordinance in place that was
progressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: That had environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the state screwed up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They allowed stacking of licenses,
and they wiped out farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that the farmers knew what they were
doing, how to get into the space,
[SPEAKER_05]: or branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all other separate conversation,
but the point is that you can organize
using stakeholder groups.
You bring everybody into the room,
and you'll find your allies.
They will emerge.
They're in the political world.
They're just afraid, but you give them a
place to speak as an organizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really powerful.
Create places that you wouldn't think to
go to the Rotary Club.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever it is, they're out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these places, and they're all
interested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every country has veterans of war,
and all of them have PTSD and physical
[SPEAKER_02]: pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all of them are being prescribed
opiates right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, as we're diversifying our voices,
one thing I've noticed is the only people
[SPEAKER_02]: advocating for cannabis is usually
business people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a legislator, and I saw business
people coming to advocate for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not trust them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that they were just doing it
to do business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, what we've seen in
California is that the patients don't come
[SPEAKER_02]: out and lobby with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go to the city council meetings
until one in the morning on a Tuesday
[SPEAKER_02]: night, in the middle of the night,
it's all business people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not convincing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's something we need to
really think about with these stakeholder
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many business people in here have
actually held the stakeholder meetings
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond maybe a focus group for early stage
branding, market research, who's really
[SPEAKER_02]: getting people together if we're saying
we're all fighting for these people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are these people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they at the old folks' home?
[SPEAKER_02]: In Berkeley or in the Bay Area,
we had Sue Taylor who was bringing it into
[SPEAKER_02]: old folks' homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were able to get topical rubs with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that had to go into the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking to school teachers, how are we
doing this work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really ask yourself, how are you really
talking to the end consumer and having
[SPEAKER_02]: them talk back to the legislators?
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot do it alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's way too few of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority of people are either neutral
or uncomfortable around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other business people, we're all busy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about you guys, but I've been
working 90-hour weeks for the last two
[SPEAKER_02]: years without a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just with iSpyre, before that,
it's like six, seven years in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry with no breaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a crisis where this is not a game
to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people dying every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people rotting in jail who are a
lot darker skin than me for doing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: less than what I do every day and get
applauded for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have many resources, but we have
the love and the organizing and the
[SPEAKER_02]: networking and leaning into that and that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they say this with women too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like having more people in the
business is not just a feel-good move.
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually objectively in the data have
better innovation, more disruptive
[SPEAKER_02]: technology, and even the same thing with
women and people of color in the
[SPEAKER_02]: workspace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just so you can feel good that
there's chicks on your team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Women and people of color provide
incredible insights that build out the end
[SPEAKER_02]: result for your consumer and you sell
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love is lucrative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we have to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: The love is lucrative, but how are we
going to actually organizing it together?
[SPEAKER_02]: To your point, stakeholders are rarely in
the room with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of these conversations in
these silos and it's an echo chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really invite you guys to talk to the
soccer moms, go to the places where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're focused on wine and cocaine at the
club when I'm out in the back dabbing and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's railing lines and start a
conversation and be like, this is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I integrate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about the cannabis industry to
people who are not in the industry all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time because the best way to stop the war
on drugs from making more veterans of the
[SPEAKER_02]: war on drugs is to stop making the laws
that criminalize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every person who's a voting person has a
voice in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like he said, this is not about
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a movement, a mass movement for
medical freedom and go through the world
[SPEAKER_02]: talking like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a conduit of this social and
physical and emotional change that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: all going through and you should be very,
very, very proud of what you do and be
[SPEAKER_02]: very forward about what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a public school teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw my credential in English in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go back and teach at any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a choice to openly be in cannabis
and I'm proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: When former students reach out to me,
they're always stoked to see what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents are proud of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense for someone with a
master's in teaching to be slaying weed at
[SPEAKER_02]: an international level, maybe not on
paper, but the change that I'm making in
[SPEAKER_02]: my life and the amount of times that I've
been scared to move forward in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: The universe has shown me that this is the
right path.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just here to show you that we've
been through a decade of absolute hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like being in an abusive relationship
with someone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that this industry is only going
to keep harming you and you show up every
[SPEAKER_02]: day loving it unconditionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can do it, you guys can absolutely
do it and we are totally here for you
[SPEAKER_02]: every step of the way as you guys roll
this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our pain, all of our suffering that
we've gone through, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to go through it again if we have
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody needs me for any reason,
there's a ton of examples as to why
[SPEAKER_03]: limited licensing is a failure and why
extensive licensing is a success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who ever says the Oklahoma industry
sucks, that's just somebody who couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: compete and couldn't win and who expected
too much and wanted to keep prices of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may say one thing, because we are in
Germany and I am reminded that in 1945 the
[SPEAKER_03]: peace was made and they thought it was a
good idea to divide up into four,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually it was more than four sections,
like five, six, seven, but famously four
[SPEAKER_03]: sections, United States, France,
etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took until 1991 to unify and get that
right and let the people of Germany come
[SPEAKER_03]: together as one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they had to be tabless, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know that Germany is a great united
country now and think about that,
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, if I can leave you with one
thing, I was listening to how the
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders meetings, what happened with
the parliamentarians last summer and that
[SPEAKER_03]: work has happened already here and one of
the individuals was telling me that there
[SPEAKER_03]: was not one person who was advocating for
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't need to talk about that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about let's kill limited
licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about that because it's about
the market structure and you do not want
[SPEAKER_03]: to wait 45 years to get that right the
next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about talking,
but the other really important piece is
[SPEAKER_04]: listening and knowing when to change your
message because a lot of the early success
[SPEAKER_04]: I had as I was coming into these meetings
where medical cannabis advocates would be
[SPEAKER_04]: expounding all the benefits of medical
cannabis to a city council who doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really, whether he believes you or not,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not part of his job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something that's going to get
him somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you kind of show them, hey,
look, this is what happened in all these
[SPEAKER_04]: cities in California and these guys
regulated early and they've got no
[SPEAKER_04]: problems and they're improving their
industry all the time and these guys tried
[SPEAKER_04]: to fight it and got hit with 10,000
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as soon as they see something
like that, that triggers somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's important to know your audience
and the message.
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of which, are there any
questions in the audience?
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone got anything to hear?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it from the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of questions this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this question is maybe primarily
for Dimitri, but maybe for the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of what's going on in
New Mexico, your neighbor, which has
[SPEAKER_06]: seemingly adopted the opposite of a
limited licensing framework?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned Oklahoma, but just curious
about New Mexico and other models,
[SPEAKER_06]: what they've done right and what they can
do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some questions, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's better, anything that
moves away from limited licensing and more
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity is better than not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me give you an example in Arizona
what we have going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have brands that are migrating in to
use intrastate models.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now we have all these brands
coming in from Oklahoma that have
[SPEAKER_03]: successfully competed and won against 300
other gummy lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the businessmen know that these brands
have shown some sort of success with the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers and patients that is desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are more likely to take them in
than a brand from Arizona who doesn't just
[SPEAKER_03]: as competing as 25 other gummy lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anywhere there's more competition,
you're going to find a better marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is simple economics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that we've adopted and
it's been replicated over and over again
[SPEAKER_03]: because people are like, what are they
doing in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they keep up, up, up,
up, up, up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to stop this domino effect at
some point and somebody is going to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was the German chancellor in charge
of, is there a chancellor again?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was in charge of Germany,
I would say we want to be the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want innovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be known globally as the best
cannabis manufacturers, cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's northern Europe, so it's a
little different, but at least
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers, product producers anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to create a free market and
we're going to teach the Americans what a
[SPEAKER_03]: free market is because you guys didn't get
it right over there in the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we are going to get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like New Mexico if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think New Mexico
did really well while they were drafting
[SPEAKER_00]: their legislation is they did a thorough
scan of what not to do and they literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had multiple conversations with the
legislative members or drafting law and
[SPEAKER_00]: they knew that we had a lot of data around
the industry and they just, we would set
[SPEAKER_00]: up these working sessions for hours and
they would ask us for data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would dig it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would pull pieces of law that we
thought, okay, New Jersey got this section
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this right in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did, they looked at everything and
then tried to do the best that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: do to start it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have since legalizing have
realized they made some mistakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already going back to fix it next
January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they've gone in eyes wide open
and we're really open to hearing what
[SPEAKER_00]: worked and hasn't worked across the United
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the idea that talk to the
legislators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go call them up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have staff people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you blow up their offices,
they have meetings about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis people being loud is the only
reason you even know the word California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And bring them on a medical cannabis
patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, I hate to be cynical
sounding, but I mean, every time we did a
[SPEAKER_05]: lawsuit on behalf of medical cannabis
patients, we put our, we got someone in a
[SPEAKER_05]: wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put people up right in front,
right in front and made sure that the
[SPEAKER_05]: community and that everybody saw what was
going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: That this was about access for people who
needed to use cannabis for whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: reason, but we gave them some really
compelling reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some nuances that are really wrong
as Bridget was saying with New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in general, heading in that direction
is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, right up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, great conversation here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So great to be back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very lucky for the Germans to
hear these insights because it's all very
[SPEAKER_07]: similar to what they're going to be going
through.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we didn't have that when we started,
but I wanted to talk about education
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think a lot of the things that
could be solved, because we did education
[SPEAKER_07]: much later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie knows we did a bunch of education
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be nice if everyone just
consolidated education?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if anyone has any
thoughts on, is there a way that we can
[SPEAKER_07]: just help educate, work together to make
one Bible of education to share around the
[SPEAKER_07]: world, which will make all of our jobs
easier?
[SPEAKER_07]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a shameless plug right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: WMPolicy.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been gathering data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have papers from different thought
leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of policy papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also put in requests where we
are pulling as much as we can from the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, making sure that we have best
practices there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that has been a
labor of love for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have done a good job of
gathering a lot of the information that
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: WMPolicy.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weed maps.
[SPEAKER_05]: WM for weed maps.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also seeing, actually, when we talk
about education, we're actually seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the community colleges and
colleges and law schools actually having
[SPEAKER_05]: curriculum now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, where they really need curriculum is
in the medical schools, because they did
[SPEAKER_05]: surveys and medical students aren't taught
about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of work that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's people developing curriculum
for higher education.
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't let us get into the grammar
schools and the elementary schools and the
[SPEAKER_05]: high schools.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can go into the community colleges
and law schools and universities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, I think, is a long process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a piecemeal approach
that Alex is trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in Canada, so I taught one of the
first courses at a university level on
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there was multiple other ones
that were written.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the laws were being changed at the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was no uniform approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen it particularly affect our
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pharmacies were asked if they wanted to be
part of the medical program before
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of them wanted to touch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after recreational legalization,
all the pharmacies wanted to jump on board
[SPEAKER_04]: and started saying, we're the only ones
that should be prescribing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they still didn't bother to teach
anybody about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pharmacological colleges were
still like, no, doctors colleges don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still anti-cannabis,
which is mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we are in 2022, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say, did anybody else notice
that you look closely at those lights that
[SPEAKER_03]: are green and red?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I noticed that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought maybe I was having a flashback
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have the ceiling here and the
reggae colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
