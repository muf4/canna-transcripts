[SPEAKER_04]: Please, may I invite my panelists to join
me here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flita, Solomon, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mary Sanchez, Bernadis Miller.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see some movement, not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, my name is Daniel Hayden.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run the cannabis law practice at the
largest work-based law firm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the co-chair of the International
Cannabis Bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Association Europe section.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm half Israeli, half Swiss and I have
three kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I would like my other panelists to
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we start with Flita.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very dry topic, so we're going to
try and make it exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Flita.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the CEO of Little Green Farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally an Australian company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are listed on the Australian Securities
Exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a large operation in Denmark,
so we are exporting our medicines,
[SPEAKER_02]: mainly across Europe, but also Australia
and Australasia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm really excited to be here and I
can contribute quite a lot to the
[SPEAKER_02]: complexities that the entire globe poses
in terms of quality standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been very difficult to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Mary Sanchez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a lawyer, colleague of Daniel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm French and based in Paris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally focused on life sciences
regulatory law and moved to cannabis three
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half years ago when it reached
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping those guys trying to figure
out how to navigate the complex regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll discuss a very interesting and dry
topic today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Elias.
[SPEAKER_03]: I founded Demecan in 2017, which is the
only German company that is allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: operate in all verticals in Germany and
Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited because the topic of
today, quality standards on a global
[SPEAKER_03]: level, are so important and nobody
realizes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've listened to our politicians
before, I think they thought about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they didn't address it to you guys in
their panel and I think it's over your
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The subject today is the quest for one
global cannabis standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: This may suggest that there's no global
cannabis standards at all today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we all know that there are a
lot of standards already in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The medical markets, the recreational
markets, they all overlap.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to figure out now which
standards we're talking about in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you guys can tell me which standards
are we talking about at all here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's an interesting question
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think probably a place to start would
be, there are a couple of different or
[SPEAKER_02]: many different monographs for a start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a couple of general monographs,
like the EU monograph and then you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: the US monograph.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have these global agglomerates of
pharmacopoeias, but then you've also got
[SPEAKER_02]: national monographs as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each country, sometimes even each state or
individual can have their own monograph.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one rules?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ICH guidelines actually probably sit
on top of all of those standards,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then of course underneath those you've
got the EUGMP, which is looking at the API
[SPEAKER_02]: and medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got starting materials,
which is more around the GACP side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we start talking about standards,
there are so many different things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can unpack, I guess, from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's knowing which one rules in the
country that you're working in or trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you speak about the monographs,
you're referring to quality standards,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the first instance, that are relevant
for the pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many different standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we sort of discussed earlier about
ESG.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all sorts of standards,
but I'm just at the moment referring to
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality standards in terms of the
final products and preparations so that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can export these.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have global patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about global patients,
there really needs to be a global
[SPEAKER_02]: standard, a baseline standard that
everybody can refer to because we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the same efficacy, the same quality
controls, the same safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be an even playing field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's probably the topic
today that we'll unpack along those
[SPEAKER_01]: quality lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really agree with you when you say we
have global patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key coming from a
pharmaceutical background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can relate to this issue is that the
patient and the therapeutic indications
[SPEAKER_01]: that are elected for medical cannabis are
similar in many countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to quality and safety of
the products, we can see that from one
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the world to another one,
the criterias vary and the quality varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP, yes, it's a very standard word,
if I can say, but GMP in North America is
[SPEAKER_01]: different from GMP in Europe, for
instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though there may be agreements on
importation depending on the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason we were discussing just in
Europe, there are so many differences from
[SPEAKER_01]: country to another that there are still
issues, technically speaking, when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to bringing products from country to
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some countries are more open than others
on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, just to quote the French
example, where medical cannabis is still
[SPEAKER_01]: not legalized, but they're already started
publishing laws because we're expecting
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization next year, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: They speak about EU GMPs and any other
equivalent standards that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very wide wording, and
eventually, technically speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: any company that would like to bring in
their products as medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: France will have to have their entire
dossier assessed by the competent health
[SPEAKER_01]: authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems easy on the paper, and the
reality is going to be in FLIDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: who is part, actually, who your company is
part of the pilot program currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you didn't talk about the
difficulties you faced when fighting and
[SPEAKER_01]: submitting the dossier and everything you
had to go through with the ANSM to have
[SPEAKER_01]: your standards recognized and approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to take a step back, because we're
already diving right into the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: markets, are these standards that you just
mentioned a good base way for the
[SPEAKER_04]: recreation markets to create products in
the recreation markets?
[SPEAKER_04]: Going forward, you think that should be
the basis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most definitely, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should talk about what we would
want to achieve with a global cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can all agree that we would
like the commodity, cannabis, to freely
[SPEAKER_03]: flow from day to day all around the globe
and taking advantage of favorable
[SPEAKER_03]: climates, favorable cost structures,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be necessary for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: One, as a quality assurance standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: EU GMP, by no means is any way how to
define your specification.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is a certificate you earn by
the government for producing in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: assures constant quality and that you're
able to learn from your failures.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most common definition of EU
GMP, and I think we all agree that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody who's producing cannabis should
abide to this standard, this mindset,
[SPEAKER_03]: or this rules of EU GMP, because it's
helping patients and it will help
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also levels the interaction
possibilities of all companies around the
[SPEAKER_03]: globe, because then you can actually go
from one country with your product to the
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we come to specification,
and I think here it's really crucial,
[SPEAKER_03]: because for us purchasing product from all
around the globe, we always face this
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge that, first of all, the yield
that you achieve through one country or
[SPEAKER_03]: the other might differ, but there's also
mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you wanna have a specification of
cannabis all around the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the allowed threshold for mold?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the allowed threshold for yeast?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the allowed threshold for
aerobics?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the allowed threshold for THC
variants?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are the four you wanna look
for, and you wanna start discussing around
[SPEAKER_03]: the globe what they should look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they look like in Germany?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very tight, very strict.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're importing beautiful product from
LGP, from Australia, and I think we agree
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard to grow something as high
quality as this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, should that be the standard for
everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: In my humble opinion, yes, but it's
debatable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we should have one standard there in
what is cannabis looked like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you mentioned global trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a commodities trader before I became
a lawyer, actually, and we traded coal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We traded coal, fertilizer, and there was
always a spec sheet based on the
[SPEAKER_04]: specification to adapt it to price.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was always a direct correlation also
to the letters of credit and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not there yet in this market,
but eventually it's gonna become a
[SPEAKER_04]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if commodities move, as you say,
we need standardized specification models
[SPEAKER_04]: summed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on which specifications do you think
pricing should be determined in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis space?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit...
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just THC, so higher THC, higher
price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what it should be?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think it should be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be creative here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivation method should pay off,
because what fleeter is growing in her
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor greenhouse in Australia,
what Demicam is producing in Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: in indoor production environment,
is totally different product from hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hybrid greenhouse means there is
additional lighting, but still the product
[SPEAKER_03]: is more stiff, it's more fluffy,
it's not as dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: The active ingredients, they're very much
more, because there might be a cloud over
[SPEAKER_03]: your greenhouse, so it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think cultivation method should pay
off, THC level should pay off,
[SPEAKER_03]: and turbulence should pay off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they will naturally do the
last two, but cultivation method is not
[SPEAKER_03]: paying off yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cultivation method, indoor, highest price
greenhouse, one level lower outdoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: even cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could even go a step further,
and it probably comes back a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: into the differences in countries'
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, for example, if you look at
pesticides, I think in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can have... Some pesticides are
approved, and it has to be at a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: level, whereas in Denmark and Australia,
you cannot use any pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that worth more in the final product?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it's a consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you look at foreign
material, I think in the US, they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: max of 5%, whereas in everywhere else,
it's up to 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aflatoxins, I think, again, UK,
it's higher, Israel, it's higher,
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere else, aflatoxins must be lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes back to this whole,
we're all singing from different in-books
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, and I think once you're all on
that playing field, that even playing
[SPEAKER_02]: field, and you have got one standard,
or something to aspire to, then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: start looking at, okay, what's the pricing
mechanism for these commodities?
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps we can have certain bands,
one band is for indoor production with
[SPEAKER_04]: certain specifications described,
second band for greenhouse, third band for
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor production, all with something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's take a step further.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can give us a little bit of
insight into the challenges of
[SPEAKER_04]: cross-border trade, what you really
experience in everyday life, because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: very different to export to Germany,
to France, what does that mean in
[SPEAKER_04]: practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is different, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've really got to be across every
single country, and even though they might
[SPEAKER_02]: be part of the EU, every country is so
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think because the requirements are
different, there are issues when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to release testing or batch testing,
even packaging and storage is difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even knowing where EU GMP starts in
each country, I mean, who would have
[SPEAKER_02]: thought that every single country could be
different?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that probably needs to be
standardized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you explain that point, just where it
starts?
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, where does EU GMP start?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the gray area because it depends
on the jurisdiction as to where GACP
[SPEAKER_02]: finishes and where does EU GMP start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is different, literally
different than every country.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it in Germany?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it used to be that, well, in Germany,
you have to understand it's two law
[SPEAKER_03]: spheres that are governing cannabis as of
today will change in the future,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously, where there will be
recreational cannabis, but it's narcotic
[SPEAKER_03]: law and it's medical law, and
pharmaceutical law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pharmaceutical law is handled by
different states in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not federal level, but the
different states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they all have a different view on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, as a general note on how it's
handled in Germany, GACP stops after
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest, so you harvest your product,
you might prune, trim, take the leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: away, so under GACP, and then you take it
into your GMP area and you either dry
[SPEAKER_03]: first or trim first and then dry or trim,
and then you package and you store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is under EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was arguable that drying could also
occur in GACP and you only perform
[SPEAKER_03]: repackaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some of my competitors who are
following this model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Bfarm has been contemplating and
publishing new ideas where it's pointing
[SPEAKER_03]: in the direction that drying might have to
be under EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is yet another idea that the
regulator is coming up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marie, in France?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in France right now, we're only
dealing with finished products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have this question yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, regarding if we read the
regulation I mentioned earlier on
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, that's actually an exception
to the general prohibition of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: France.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only mentions GMP for all the stages or
equivalent standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will be interesting to see when we
go further with the regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the difficulties you mentioned
regarding imports, even pricing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I come back to the pricing question
based on how you grow the products and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, I think this is going to be
the standard and the quality standard as a
[SPEAKER_01]: basis will not be sufficient depending on
the countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each country has a different way of fixing
pricing for products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we regard France, which is the pain
in the neck in the world regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical products and everything
because we like to make things
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated, price fixing for medical
cannabis hasn't been set up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't tell you how it's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we consider it as a medicinal
product, we know how difficult it is to
[SPEAKER_01]: negotiate with the pricing authority in
France.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it could be part of the
discussion why they're trying to set up
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules to use that as basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do not believe it will be sufficient
and it will be the only criteria to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the price set up for your products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to more challenges in
actually bringing product to one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look, I think, I mean, even,
yeah, where did I get to before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, where the EU starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, that sort of dictates
from there how you import and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: export.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think when you look at the release of
the batch testing, all of those influence
[SPEAKER_02]: how you actually, when you can import,
when you can export, all of the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess when you look at the other
challenges, it's more, yeah, how are you
[SPEAKER_02]: compliant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how will you, how does technology play
a role in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably a jumping the gun a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, in terms of moving forward,
how do we start to standardise these to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it easier?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a bit of a technology play
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think understanding, you know,
if we're dealing with Italy, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is part of the EU, Australia has a
mutual recognition agreement with the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most times there is a pathway there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in Italy, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though Italy is part of the EU,
you have to be growing in Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you have to have EU GMP to get into
that country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just another example of the
headaches that are involved with each
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that as we move forward,
I personally think that there is an
[SPEAKER_02]: absolute need for a global standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's critical to address the key ideas and
elements in this medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it does need to be standardised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which standard do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is it EU GMP?
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's going to agree on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you do, this is where technology
can just be so helpful for us all moving
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you can have compliance,
you can tick some boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of waiting the six to sometimes up
to 18 months to actually get audited,
[SPEAKER_02]: processed, and then start the export,
the import, processing, and permitting
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the lengths that you have to go
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of the hard work is
being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think moving forward, it can be more
simplified.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ask, what are the biggest challenges?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one is you talk to a supplier,
a potential supplier, and they start
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about their amazing product,
really amazing product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they start saying, no mold at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least according to our specification,
we are all fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you look into their
specification, and they can have mold 10
[SPEAKER_03]: times you can have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't import.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this makes it very difficult right now,
for example, to work with US American
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that they could technically export
right now, but they wouldn't export you
[SPEAKER_03]: something you could actually import.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is testing methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't believe the headache you will
encounter when you start importing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they tell you, great God, really good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 30% HTC and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you bring it over, buying it after
months and months and negotiations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you test it according to EUGP testing
methods here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you find out it's 23%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's loads of teaching methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: HTC missing because the testing methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to highlight this testing
methods are as important as specifications
[SPEAKER_03]: to harmonize in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this very well from trading,
because we had certain guys who went to
[SPEAKER_04]: ASTM, for example, or ISO.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we knew always ASTM has a bit higher
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: It always comes out a bit higher in coal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, if you want a lower sulfur,
you need to go to ISO.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a really established
market already.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are still these inconsistencies in
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're just going to have to
find a way to live with those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we all agree the standard needs to be
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So going back to tech, traceability,
quality, control, quality, consistency,
[SPEAKER_04]: transparency are all super important
factors and pillars in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you ensure your businesses that you
are doing all paper-based?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you have some software?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we started, we helped find the
Australian industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the first producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing that we could use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially we were using paper-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then to get the actual license to
cultivate, we had to have a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to come out and design our own
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did the job for what we needed
initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to compare a standard,
it was like having a Hyundai in comparison
[SPEAKER_02]: to a Rolls-Royce of quality management
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we started where we needed to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that the company is more
established, we are investing in a big ERP
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even seen to say, oh,
this looks after every functionality
[SPEAKER_02]: within the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is super expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will give us that capability to
have oversight throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to have cultivation and manufacturing,
as well as our doctor education and
[SPEAKER_02]: patient customer service side,
it's actually really, really difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: be across all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Denmark, we recently acquired a
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is paper-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're changing that across now to a
QMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: But technology will play a key role there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you'll find there's been a bit
of both in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably rare to have one software
that covers all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as long as you have a few that capture
some of the supply chain stations,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So QR codes enabling the customer to track
and trace and to have upstream
[SPEAKER_03]: traceability.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the sense of you understand what
cultivation method is being used,
[SPEAKER_03]: what THC level, CD level, what terpenes
overall, and maybe even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is all batch-based.
[SPEAKER_03]: What major terpenes and what percentages
are in that batch, I think that is very
[SPEAKER_03]: important for customers and especially for
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also use that technology to
actually track who in the medical market
[SPEAKER_03]: was receiving the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine you're using blockchain and people
then have it in the chain that they're the
[SPEAKER_03]: owner of that unit, of that batch,
of that THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they encounter the police control,
they can actually prove that it is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually the product that was in the
pharmacy and not around the corner from
[SPEAKER_03]: the bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one last question here because I see
that time flies and maybe you want to give
[SPEAKER_04]: the audience an opportunity to ask a
question as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the most urgent area where we need
further standardization?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just each one of you, Warren.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as a lawyer, we'll start with the
basics, but quality, safety, and
[SPEAKER_01]: traceability for the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest will follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think just to be really short on
that, that the question is the quest for a
[SPEAKER_01]: global standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Global means worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not think it's entirely reachable,
but if we can have an alignment on quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and safety at least, that will definitely
open doors and facilitate the movement of
[SPEAKER_01]: the products across the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a short lawyer's answer.
It's kind of a difficult question because
the entire, this is the whole quest for a
global standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only asked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to make sure, obviously
there's the safety and efficacy,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, and the compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure our global patients
are protected from adulteration and
[SPEAKER_02]: variability in the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there needs just to be a baseline
study, or sorry, a standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't literally have all these
variabilities in the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all going to be playing on the same,
and even playing the human singing from
[SPEAKER_02]: the same book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise it's just, we're never
going to get there as a global industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the most important parts to have
already been summarized, but you too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just coming back to the testing
methods, I really believe that there needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be more discussion about that and
alignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise we will encounter sort of
challenges in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it lab-to-lab alignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like if you're an enterprise and
you want to get along and find a solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be regular, just regular
disalignment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're opening up a whole can of worms
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This lab testing is different even within
countries, even within different
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they need a standard as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it covers, this covers everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to bring it to the
attention of the lawmakers and really
[SPEAKER_04]: pound it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions from the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe one, we have one minute left,
so it's going to be a short one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.
There's another microphone.
Here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for the panel too,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take one or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, do you, have any concerns that
what you're doing with stacking on
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization on top of the regulations
and laws that you're going to wipe out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any innovative small business trying to
enter the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second, kind of related to that,
do you really need anything more than a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer safety standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there really any real need for anything
more than a consumer safety standard?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, do you look at all medicines the
same way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone that's starting a company and
having a pharmacy or medicine can just
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of have a consumer protection sort of
survey or mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but if someone's making beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if it was recreation, that's a
different topic altogether in adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food standards, again, it's a different
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a pharmaceutical-grade medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, in itself, I just think anybody,
we're small companies as well that are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting our journey, and we've had to
abide by those rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you have to have these rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we've got this patient risk in
terms of product efficacy and safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that there has to be something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'm not the expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that there just has to be the
same standard that we all play from
[SPEAKER_02]: because all of our countries are
different, and yet we're looking at global
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I may add to that, if we're
talking about medicinal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is something completely different
from recreational, even though I agree
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of recreational users are
patients originally, but that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: different topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I often say to companies that come to
me and say, hey, I want to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: business with medicinal cannabis,
I'm like, okay, are you able to think
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not able to think
pharmaceutical, you're not going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it, simply because, and I think both of
you can testify about how much investment
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to make to build facilities to
ensure safety and security of your
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities So when you ask whether it may
wipe out some small players that would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to enter the market, yes,
it will, but it's a very tricky topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a lawyer, there's also something
that all the players in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis need to understand is
as soon as you have patients involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is something that we call product
liability that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can cost you a lot if anything
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, those standards are critical and
really necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at what EUGMP requirement
in Germany and Europe and the European
[SPEAKER_03]: Pharmacopeia and the German Pharmacopeia
are doing to the product, and the end
[SPEAKER_03]: result is, in my humble opinion,
a clean product, be it for medical or be
[SPEAKER_03]: it for recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I strongly advise us all being
interested in the topic to produce clean
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it must be via EUGMP because it makes
sense, a lot of sense, then that's good,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we will have happy consumers and
happy patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually what I want,
and I think they should want it to be
[SPEAKER_03]: actually food safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: The standards are even higher standards
than for pharmaceutical products because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a weight of interest in medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And toxicological studies actually have to
pass a higher bar in foodstuffs
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a little bit over time,
so we can't take another question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's hear it again for Daniel Heyman
and Maurice Sanchez.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank you all.
