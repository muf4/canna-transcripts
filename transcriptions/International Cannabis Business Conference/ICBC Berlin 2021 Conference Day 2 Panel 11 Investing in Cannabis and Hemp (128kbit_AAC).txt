[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, what a day, what a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had thought about utilizing a lot of
information up here about being an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor and what we do, but you've heard
a lot today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I learned a lot today because
in particular, novel foods is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting topic that we're having to
discover what that really means here
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, I wanted to start by
introducing myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matt Nordgren, founder,
CEO of Arcadian Capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to be here because our firm is
moving into Europe now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're launching Arcadian Europe and
boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't be more excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our investors really have encouraged us a
lot of support there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing I think we want to do
talk about this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an industry where we create a safe
space for other people to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: No judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't the world be a perfect place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if in fact we didn't judge
anybody for anything they ever did,
[SPEAKER_01]: there might not need to be a room for an
apology even then because we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: connected through a collective conscious
like this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know back in the time when the
dinosaurs all were wiped out from Earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was nothing left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything survived through a fungal
network, frankly, through mycelium and
[SPEAKER_01]: other plant matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you really think about it,
whether you believe in God, which I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you believe in science, either way,
there's a collective conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this room, no judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a community that we're excited
to pour into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, excited about the companies here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, downstairs, a lot of cool companies,
particularly, and here's our friend Giada.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, you guys should get to know
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a hell of a female leader in this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one booth that was like a neon,
I don't even know, it was like a color
[SPEAKER_01]: room or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Felt like I was at a spa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you guys are doing it right over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many good people downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an investor, we're not judging people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting to know them, creating a
safe space for people to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our not even competing companies I
was talking with downstairs a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there is no competition in
this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't institutionalized yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all here to support each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to start this conversation with
that type of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be out running the conference,
which is a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've built this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken here before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been a lot of years for us to do anything,
I guess, wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world's healing itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you all for pouring into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you ICBC for doing that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that I'm going to tell you
a little bit about Arcadia, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to play a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something we believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everybody in here just do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in this audience today,
been walking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just take our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close our eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can just humor me, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humor me with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take three deep breaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something to do in life,
no matter where you are, just to set your
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring the blood in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Activate your parasympathetic nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring oxygen to the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you do your last one, sex your
intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your day about?
[SPEAKER_01]: This day is almost over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I want to bring this community
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm a bit of a roamer on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcadian, what do we stand for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're an investment firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 55 companies today,
all throughout the world in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we serve them, just like we're going
to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcadian is a firm that has operations in
America, corporate out of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have Arcadian Latin America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty fired up about what's happening in
Mexico these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys familiar?
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be the largest market in the
world pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually already legal if you ask
Congress, but Supreme Court, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: Congress and the senators can't figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are with Latin America,
and a lot's going to happen there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have investments in China and
the largest operation in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we come to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's Arcadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're an investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like growth equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to pour into you and build a
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been doing that to a very high
level friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, look at that energy right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room needs to be uplifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing in this space
coming out of this sickness is healing the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you don't mind my energy,
but this is the way I choose to live life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work hard and we pour into people and
that's Arcadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do a little better job of that,
Randy, Randy is going to play a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Randy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said that was a large file and
probably the team got it to you an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to do that because this
isn't about talking about us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard from a lot of experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're going to tell you about is
what an investor is supposed to do for an
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as this one matures, what we're
committed to doing here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason I asked you to set your
intentions earlier is because do you know
[SPEAKER_01]: why they call it a present?
[SPEAKER_01]: The present, this moment, mindfulness,
being here, because it's a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the greatest present we were ever
given.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're a science person,
you have two brains, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: One with which to think critically and one
to think creatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're designed to think about both 50
percent quickly and 50 percent creatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's balance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body, it's homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're all in this industry,
isn't it, Giada?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to bring health and wellness to
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is all about balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted you to be balanced coming
into this to end your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a little party after
they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you enjoy that and some of
our information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now for some informative details,
four things to pay attention to as an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor right now that we are really
excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the industry growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you watched the revenue in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do data better than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have, I think, twenty five billion
dollars in revenue this year and there may
[SPEAKER_01]: be 30 in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is growing and through
2020 at a 60 percent revenue number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the years before that,
before coronavirus, we were growing at a
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 to 30 percent in revenue number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find me another industry doing that with
these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, a similar growth in taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me much taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're paying places that legalize this a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, on top of that, jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these tech companies that are doing
great things, not finding a tremendous
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of real jobs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a consumer industry built from a
commodity, so it's going to require a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're happy to report the jobs are
growing at a tremendous clip as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of that, get ready for a bear
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the longest bull market in
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cycles have to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to not have a cyclical
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a test of psychology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so get ready for a place that is going
to be very excited for an industry that is
[SPEAKER_01]: credit worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about all the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an underwriter's dream in a bear
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting calls already to manage debt
and credit because they can't predict
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're going to find yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this industry is only going to be more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Credit worthiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banks are going to need us more than they
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are four areas to really pay
attention to that we're seeing be very
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumental in bringing in the
institutional class.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really two groups we want to talk to
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, this is what at Arcadian we
do really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We serve our investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resource providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in this room and you are a
resource provider to this industry in some
[SPEAKER_01]: way, will you raise your hand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our friend Nick, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tremendous, tremendous to see you,
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing this for a long time,
haven't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for being a partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else in here an investor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, chairman and CEO of a
public company, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you bring a lot of resources to this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, of course, Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a great job Bo did earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked together at a number of
places and encourage you to spend some
[SPEAKER_01]: time with Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a resource provider to this
space, we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I are at Arcadian Cap or Arcadianfund.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our commitment is to serve you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this industry, and if you look at an
emerging industry throughout history,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to be hedge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of amazing companies here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen them all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing is
pre-institutionalization, you see a highly
[SPEAKER_01]: fragmented space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it needs to be put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go back to the 90s and look at
Google or Facebook or Apple or Amazon,
[SPEAKER_01]: any of these companies that ended up being
who they are today, go look at the cap
[SPEAKER_01]: table in the early days, the A round,
the B round, the C round.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find Andreessen Horowitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find General Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find Benchmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ultimately, it's the investor's job
to manage capital, care about companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: invest throughout the whole supply chain
of an emerging industry, and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: See things from a macro level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're an investor here,
definitely pour into these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would encourage you to reach out to
the top five or 10 investors that have
[SPEAKER_01]: groups doing this in the world and think
about that as an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, our real job is to
provide return to those investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are here and you run a
company and you're looking for resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be more of you than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means everyone else in here is
doing what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you either have resources you want
to give to this industry or you need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in either way, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come to Arcadian and we're going to
listen to you and figure out a way to pour
[SPEAKER_01]: into your needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're an investor, we have several
funds in several countries and we would
[SPEAKER_01]: love to offer those to you if you're an
accredited individual and believe in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a company, well, that's what
we're here to really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that through a multitude of
funds, like Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick is called, his name actually is for
multi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of what he does as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're here to address each opportunity
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our investor team, you can reach
them at investments at arcadianfund.com,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a business and you love
our team to look through one of our funds,
[SPEAKER_01]: to partner with you, please call us,
please email us, investments at
[SPEAKER_01]: arcadianfund.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we will never let anybody
not be hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage you to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set those intentions when you come in,
do this the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're building something real special
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in this industry to trade in and
out of it, we're going to find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found you before, and you're going to
be probably not too happy with the result
[SPEAKER_01]: because this industry is about community,
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you, and it won't be any
different here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, the winners are going to do it
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just talking about that,
weren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have companies that are in the same
category, that are trying to figure out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're public, and they want to work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we expect our companies to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please reach out to us if,
in fact, you'd like to have our team a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three main phases to this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as this one develops here,
think about these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the fundamental aspect,
the core.
[SPEAKER_01]: The foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen in other markets is
that would involve cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: retail, manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very sensitive in different
places, and it has to be figured out for
[SPEAKER_01]: there to be any industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think about that today in most
places in larger markets as credit and
[SPEAKER_01]: debt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, we're going to be providing equity
for that line of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some more information about the
capital we provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this market, it would be equity if
you're in the US or a larger market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be credit and debt from our
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those multiples on valuations won't get
any higher than they did in 2017 and 18,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had agriculture businesses trading at
100 times their revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just not the case,
even in an industry growing 40% to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has been corrected now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's opportunity for credit and
debt there, we think, in the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: and equity here as this one builds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second phase being, well, the B2B
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the picks and axes of the
industry, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a gold industry analyst,
you look at the value of gold,
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry that takes it from the ground
to the consumer, and ultimately what the
[SPEAKER_01]: use is for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the third aspect, which is B2C.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these we see grow in a little bit
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at all of them here,
and we encourage you to reach out to us if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're involved in any of those aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest things I think that we
have to think about in this space is the
[SPEAKER_01]: ESG component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are in a world where all of these
industries that are large and scaled,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to figure out how to
reverse engineer, how to think about the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, how to think about animal welfare,
how to empower women in the workplace,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to think about minorities in the
workplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the great thing about this space is
we get to do that from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you build this space,
here and as you come across other people
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, encourage people to think this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an important topic for us at
Arcadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask all of our companies these
questions in order to verify certain
[SPEAKER_01]: operational procedures that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so please do think about that aspect
as you build this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you come to us, we're going to ask
you about it and try to track it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do, but we're going to try to
track all of those characteristics because
[SPEAKER_01]: we believe that if a market's about
psychology, then what you're noticing is
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70-year-old community and the
60-year-old community and 50, as these
[SPEAKER_01]: decades continue to grow, the thinking
behind the younger generation is not just
[SPEAKER_01]: financial.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other things that motivate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so watch these markets change
throughout the rest of your lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a third component.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just, is it cheaper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: The markets now, the people that make
decisions with that capital that are
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to grow up and take over their
father or grandfathers' capital,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're asking themselves, is this better
for the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this better for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the psychology behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you should be encouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're doing right now will continue
to matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thinkers behind the people that
provide all those resources think
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, we don't want to
take a lot of your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we think here, is that this is
about moving forward and either fear or
[SPEAKER_01]: faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You realize everything that ever happened
in your life before this moment only lives
[SPEAKER_01]: in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that hadn't happened yet also
lives in your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the form of faith or fear, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why not choose hope, faith?
[SPEAKER_01]: In what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some sense, you think about this
as it's not what the world does to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about what we do to the world as
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you don't believe me,
just think about how data flows,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the pyramidal cell into the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately there's a chance for
the chandelier cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there to repeat, look at repeated
negative data patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the event that it does,
it starts to close down your neural
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway to enter the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately once it gets through,
and hopefully you're balanced and mindful,
[SPEAKER_01]: in which case your chandelier cell will
open and you'll have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: flow into the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It then goes to what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 to 100 billion neurons to be processed
that could be connected with 10,000 other
[SPEAKER_01]: neurons, creating a neural network that's
absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is why it matters to be in the
moment because it's the only place you can
[SPEAKER_01]: make a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are in this moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to just use this time to try to
get people excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard a lot of information today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the answers you wish to find in
life are in fact in the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right in front of you if you're
going to pay close enough attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is because that's
where data is processed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sit with the past and future too
much, you can't take in data from the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in the past and future is in
your head again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just ask that you pay attention
to the moment you're in, pay attention to
[SPEAKER_01]: the people around you, pay attention to
Arcadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a great job at investing in
companies and managing capital for other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if any of this aligns with you,
let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we feel blessed to be here
and that's our choice to feel that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you on the video too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have time for a few questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Norgren, are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's all go home then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear one more time for Matt Norgren
from Arcadian Financial Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
