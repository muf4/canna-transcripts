[SPEAKER_05]: This is a panel on differentiating in the
CBD space, the crowded CBD space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got a really an interesting
panel of diverse views that will be
[SPEAKER_05]: chiming in, give you guys more perspective
from different smart minds on how to
[SPEAKER_05]: accomplish the differentiation,
grow your products and brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the panel we have, and I'm gonna sort
of give them up, just name them and
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll give you a quick once over on who
they are and a little bit about their
[SPEAKER_05]: companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first I've got Scott Goldie,
CEO of Goldenseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I am Scott Goldie, the CEO of
Goldenseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Goldenseed is a corporation and we're
involved in both the cannabis and the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're vertically integrated in both of
those sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started in December of 17 and our first
crops will be coming to market in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Omar Figueroa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a lawyer in cannabis for 21
years here in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also a director of the National
Cannabis Industry Association,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as the California Cannabis Tourism
Association, as well as the International
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Bar Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also the author of a book,
California Cannabis Laws and Regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: 2020, which is basically a carefully
curated compendium of laws and regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: pertaining to hemp and cannabis here in
the Golden State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ken Stratton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a partner with the law firm,
Ragaway Law Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: The firm was established in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three offices in the state,
one in LA, one in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: My practice is about 50-50 corporate and
litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And firm-wide, the litigation is about
50-50 between defense work and plaintiffs'
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before Ragaway, I was in private practice
as a labor and employment attorney and a
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate securities attorney for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went in-house and I helped run
three life science companies as the senior
[SPEAKER_01]: legal counsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of the life science companies were
publicly traded with about $500 million
[SPEAKER_01]: market cap, both developing therapeutics
for different indications in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another was an international
conglomerate called Medtronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to pass this around or just
talk very loud?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're going to jump right in.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very deep field.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think exactly what the title of this
panel is I think is a really, really
[SPEAKER_05]: poignant question.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there are some direct answers
that you'll get from everybody on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll start out by saying, what are the
keys to differentiate your product or
[SPEAKER_05]: brand in CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we've started growing hemp last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key for differentiation,
I think, for us is a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have proprietary genetics that
have been developed really over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the uniqueness about them is that
they're very high CBD percentages,
[SPEAKER_00]: some over 20%, and very, very high terpium
profiles, and very unique terpium
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going out to the market and we
could have those types of attributes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lends itself really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, to smokable hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dean and I are working in a
partnership to create a retail product
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be hemp cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that's very large in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be very large
here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really at the forefront of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're looking for were the type
of genetics in hemp CBD that we can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that I think is really
unique for us in terms of branding is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow everything organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own worm farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create our own soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chemicals or pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were meeting with a wellness
company last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling products that are there to
benefit people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love that kind of ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll actually be incorporated into
their marketing of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think for us, because we're
vertically integrated, we've started with
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, we want to get into our own
retail products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of our own hemp brands with
Dean, hemp cigarette, and other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's going to need to be a
focus on product safety and on testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be more awareness that
cannabis and hemp are both incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: effective phyto-remediators.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that they are organisms that
remove toxins from the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these toxins usually end up on the
plant body itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this awareness that cannabis and
hemp are both bio-accumulators and that
[SPEAKER_04]: they can accumulate toxins really,
then the next question is, which products
[SPEAKER_04]: are safe for human consumption?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think a focus on safety
and on testing will really give somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: in a very crowded marketplace an edge
because they can say, our products are
[SPEAKER_04]: tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows that cannabis is super
effective at removing toxins from the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you have to be careful to not be
buying gas stations, CBD, because those
[SPEAKER_04]: products are probably very poisonous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other part in differentiation is
building a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to build a brand,
you need to be able to first of all,
[SPEAKER_04]: pick a distinctive name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say Northern Emerald Wellness
because that's so generic and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really stand out from other similar names.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to pick something that's
either what's called in trademark law
[SPEAKER_04]: fanciful, some made up name, or hopefully
arbitrary, something that has nothing to
[SPEAKER_04]: do with describing this brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also tell a story.
[SPEAKER_04]: The brands that really resonate have
authentic stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about how Lowell Farms had
some invented story about Lowell in 1913.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really like a man wearing a
bull wearing a suit was really the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of like a made up story with
no authenticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think when you're building a brand,
you want to focus on telling a story
[SPEAKER_04]: that's authentic.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm hearing from you is a focus on
sustainability and organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that resonates with the consumers in
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think building a strong brand is
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll try to leave some stuff for Ken.
[SPEAKER_05]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these now work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll echo what Omar said.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective, and I approach it
from the perspective of a corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney who has raised capital for
countless companies and helped them sell
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, helped founders realize their
liquidity of the events in the dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow businesses that are going to last
for the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can differentiate all you want,
but what you want to do is differentiate
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself in a way that is destined to last
for the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it all comes down to trust,
maintaining trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to making claims that you
can't support, that defies and breaks down
[SPEAKER_01]: trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then control and discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to build a brand and
you're trying to convince people that your
[SPEAKER_01]: product is always going to be on the
shelves and will always have the same sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of impact and effect on your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good if the product doesn't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even worse if the product's not even
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, having the kind
of discipline and control to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have operational control,
you have legal control, and you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to build that trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, the world is divided up into
Juul and Walt Disney.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Juul is a company that violated
people's trust because it's pretty clear
[SPEAKER_01]: Juul targeted children in a way that was
inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already know how the FDA feels about
CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't target children.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good for a number of reasons,
but that violated trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walt Disney is every bit as aggressive and
successful as Juul has ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walt Disney single-handedly destroyed
copyright law in America to save Mickey
[SPEAKER_01]: Mouse, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make sure that Mickey Mouse continued
to make them gobs of money into the
[SPEAKER_01]: foreseeable future 200 years out,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very successful, but they built
trust and they had operational control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, from my perspective as
a corporate attorney, that's what my
[SPEAKER_01]: advice would be to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think those are all great answers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my takeaway, first, I realized I
didn't introduce myself, but I help run
[SPEAKER_05]: Bud.com and Wagner DeMoss, which is a
technology that is patented for the
[SPEAKER_05]: production of pre-rolls and scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm an operator and investor,
a lot like Scott.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think everything that I heard
resonated with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it starts with safety,
because I don't think you're in the game
[SPEAKER_05]: unless your product is at that par.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think from there, I would say quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you have a quality product,
irrespective of what sector you're in,
[SPEAKER_05]: relative to the other entrance,
the competition, if you have a great
[SPEAKER_05]: product, you're gonna be, you're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna be positioned to win.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've gotta market and do some other
things, but I think at a banal level,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've gotta know that you can come out
with a quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us, we were operating in cannabis
and it became very evident when the farm
[SPEAKER_05]: bill passed that our technology for
rolling pre-rolls was gonna be very
[SPEAKER_05]: applicable to hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the type of smokable hemp flower that
certain forward-thinking breeders were
[SPEAKER_05]: creating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Scott happened to be one of those
folks who was forward-thinking in creating
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, over generations,
Scott's partner was breeding down the THC
[SPEAKER_05]: from strains that we all know and breeding
it into other cannabinoids and also
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've got this high-terp flower,
and then I see my service, our asset,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that we build these machines that are
able to produce joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unlike tobacco equipment that don't work
with sticky resinous substances,
[SPEAKER_05]: ours do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now, their sticky hemp and our
technology can come together and see a
[SPEAKER_05]: market that is far greater than the 500,
140 dispensaries that our cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-rolls are in in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a much bigger addressable
market if your resources as a business are
[SPEAKER_05]: conducive to being unique and coming up
with a great product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what it is for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll jump to the next question here,
which is now that we're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: products and the fact that quality and all
these different factors are gonna be sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of really determining factors that you're
gonna win, what can you do to take steps
[SPEAKER_05]: to appealing to consumers?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've touched on this a little
bit, but what can your products do,
[SPEAKER_05]: or what can you do with your products to
best appeal to consumers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Start with Omar here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think really being careful with
the packaging and labeling and not
[SPEAKER_04]: overselling the products, not making any
medical claims, which are for sure gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: draw FDA scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the pitfalls to avoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically the understanding
about the medical benefits of CBD is
[SPEAKER_04]: already out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no need to be repeating it and
drawing FDA scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's something important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Others are making those claims for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good plan, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken?
[SPEAKER_05]: About products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to defer to the operational
folks for most of the product development
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, but I can say that as you are
thinking about your products and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about differentiating yourself,
you should also be thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting your intellectual property
around the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already talked a little bit
about trademarks, but there are things
[SPEAKER_01]: like trade dress, which is basically a
trademark for the look and feel of your
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've found in my own business experiences
that some degree of consistency helps
[SPEAKER_01]: build that trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes familiar, and whatever's
familiar is loved, and then whatever's
[SPEAKER_01]: loved is bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I find to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anecdotally, I would say that
there are a lot of products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bit of a, for the newbies who
are going into the local dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a bit of an overwhelming experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are ways to simplify and get your
message through clearly, and it works for
[SPEAKER_01]: you, then keep driving it home,
driving it home, because I think there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of noise, and a simple, consistent
message can help build that brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simple is generally good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, you've got several SKUs of
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for us, again, it was said earlier,
creating a lifestyle brand is really the
[SPEAKER_00]: key to creating enterprise value at a
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, when we created our Golden
Seed brand, a lot of thought went into
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, where we located our farm,
a lot of thought went into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Santa Cruz County, and the
culture of that area is very embracing of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and it always has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really looking on the cannabis
side to national distribution at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to create a very iconic
California surf brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We concentrate on surf, art, music.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some of the more prominent
investors in our company, they're already
[SPEAKER_00]: in those sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see a lot of brands out there
that have very blase names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very industrial, very, they're not
really picking up the spirit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture of these industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I also agree that the lifestyle
aspect of it has to start with a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our story, you know, we have a worm
farm, and that's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go all the way from worms to weed,
and then it's really well branded and
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that order, worms to weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me twist the question a little bit,
and I'll go right back to you,
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott, and take it down the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking about how to appeal to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything different, or what do
you need to do to appeal to investors?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is an industry that it is
competitive, and funding is something
[SPEAKER_05]: we're all battling for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what can you do with the product skews?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you frame the business for
investors?
[SPEAKER_05]: And one caveat being that Golden Seed has
just recently launched its series,
[SPEAKER_05]: or its oregue offering in January.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd love to hear about sort of how you
position the brand and how that process is
[SPEAKER_05]: going for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the capital side of this industry has
become very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started our company a couple
years ago, it's very important for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: not give up control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ken mentioned that earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we invested quite a bit of our own
capital into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very little debt, and we waited
until our company was far enough along to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in investment, because we have a
higher valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with the Regulation D
offering, which has been in the Securities
[SPEAKER_00]: Act since 1934, and that's where you're
selling shares to accredited investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be at a lower valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we continue to build our brand,
in 2015 the SEC approved an amendment to
[SPEAKER_00]: the act that allowed for sale of stock to
anyone, and it's anyone really in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's called Regulation A,
and we are qualified first week of January
[SPEAKER_00]: of this year to be the first cannabis
cultivator and retail product in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country to be able to sell shares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yesterday was our 30-day
anniversary, 30 days since we launched,
[SPEAKER_00]: and right now we have applications for
investment from over 1,000 people in 46
[SPEAKER_00]: states and 17 countries, literally in
every continent in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does for us is not only at
most we'll give up 10% of our company,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're still in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't take private equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the capital markets, a lot of
people are taking too much money,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're looking for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're a business that's looking
for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very near-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be cash flow positive,
and that's just a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through Regulation A, you raise
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create brand ambassadors throughout
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this becomes nationally legal,
we'll already have exposure in all those
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, we kind of approached it
differently, but it's gone really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on an investor call last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were over 100 people out of the
1,000 that have already come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just been very well-received.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take ownership in the company,
and we communicate really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome, and I think the benefits
will only begin to come as these folks are
[SPEAKER_05]: champions for the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think democratizing that process just
adds so much to a brand that way,
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as having brand ambassadors out
there, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the lawyers who've dealt with
this quite a bit, and your view as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: positioning the company towards
investment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think something that a lot of my clients
were in the hemp world and creating
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp-derived products for hemp-derived
products is that they're registering
[SPEAKER_04]: federal trademarks with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patent and Trademark Office for all sorts
of brands, because USPTO will register
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp trademarks after the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will not yet register the cannabis
brands, and so now you can have federally
[SPEAKER_04]: enforceable, federally registered
trademarks for hemp-derived products that
[SPEAKER_04]: the USPTO just keeps issuing, and so
that's something that I think investors
[SPEAKER_04]: will look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have any registered
trademarks at the federal level,
[SPEAKER_04]: what have you been doing with all this
investor capital so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that makes somebody more
appealing from the investment perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think your point of recruiting,
using crowdfunding and regulation A,
[SPEAKER_04]: investors all over the country who will
later become brand ambassadors is a
[SPEAKER_04]: brilliant idea, and I'm glad to be
standing next to the first company to have
[SPEAKER_04]: done this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been thinking for years, like,
when will somebody finally implement
[SPEAKER_04]: crowdfunding and regulation A for the
cannabis industry, and I would say it
[SPEAKER_04]: deserves a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll pass it on to Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably should say that,
again, these are my opinions only and not
[SPEAKER_01]: legal advice, but my perspective having
helped a number of investors make
[SPEAKER_01]: investments and countless companies raise
money, it comes down to, I'd answer the
[SPEAKER_01]: question two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it's about pulling together assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about intellectual property
assets, but there are other really
[SPEAKER_01]: important assets that investors will
always look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look at your team, so consider
your people as your assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look at your supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look at your consumer list.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look at the contracts that you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: On an earlier panel, there were some
cautionary tales about not having a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of who your owners are,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all understand that in California,
you can make a contract just orally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a contract by implication.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to write it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to sign it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do see an awful lot of people who
step forward when they see some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: great opportunity to profit, claiming to
be an owner of a cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So having some degree of good paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your leases, your contracts,
those are all assets, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To the extent that your contracts don't or
aren't terminable, you've locked in good
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you assemble together all your assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, revenue streams,
the best asset of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one way to answer it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is more of a process driven one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very, very off putting to try to
bring money in if you are a shit show,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have your things together
and lined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to close a deal if you
negotiate backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like dating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do want to build trust in that
relationship too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we try to do
with our clients is to be very careful in
[SPEAKER_01]: how they present themselves, when terms
are proposed, how they're proposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process is really, really,
really important because it is dating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that regard, it doesn't need to be
our firm, but having someone who's done
[SPEAKER_01]: the process can really, really help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been pulled into nearly failed
transactions where there was no legal
[SPEAKER_01]: advice or no business advice, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unwinding that and trying to get it
back onto the rails can be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there's a lot of value in
having someone who's been through the
[SPEAKER_01]: process many times in your corner to help
you with the process of completing that
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no doubt there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to add something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add a few things that Ken
made me think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been in the cannabis world for a
few years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a real estate background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my own development company for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're too heavily tilted
to the business side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really know that much about
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have people starting with the plant
that aren't associated themselves with
[SPEAKER_00]: competent business people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been in front of a lot of
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some really large scale investors
early on in the regulation D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do want to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see competent compliance,
accounting, systems and controls
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented in your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without that, I think number one,
you're not going to be that successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, you're not going to get
investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fully agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make yourself more
attractive to investors, basically reverse
[SPEAKER_04]: engineer the due diligence process and see
how they're going to be looking at you and
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that all of the metrics are
going to be favorable before you put
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one more point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go into the hemp world,
it's about acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about square feet like we talk
about in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're going to scale to meet
the kind of demand that Dean's company is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have, you're talking about
hundreds of acres, maybe several hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're getting into really kind
of commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not our experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabis grower at that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually partner with local strawberry
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Santa Cruz County, there's 5,000
acres of strawberry farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only deal with organic strawberry
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic strawberries can only be
planted maybe every five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need rotation crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a great experience for us to
give our genetics to that farmer and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them grow a consistent and very clean and
good product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a consistent and clean product.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, shitshow, that was a legal
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it in all the books.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually, let me just sort of pin this
down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So structurally, because again,
it is a lot of uncertainty here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Federally and then there are departures at
the state level on CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a preferred sort of formation
structure?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're talking about the ops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything to be lent there as far
as kind of a smarter way to form your
[SPEAKER_05]: company when you go out, specifically you
two guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think definitely having some
sort of corporate entity so that if
[SPEAKER_04]: there's going to be an audit, it's going
to fall on that entity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you always get the protections of the
corporate form, protection from civil
[SPEAKER_04]: liability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would say definitely always
operate with a legal entity as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: being a sole proprietor or just a general
partnership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes if people work together and they
don't have any agreement to the contrary,
[SPEAKER_04]: they never formed a corporation,
they never formed an LLC, the law in
[SPEAKER_04]: California will infer that there's a de
facto partnership.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's going to be all sorts of
obligations from one partnership to
[SPEAKER_04]: another.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's always good to give
thought to which corporate form you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to have and follow the formalities
of that corporate structure so you get all
[SPEAKER_04]: the benefits of having a corporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't do you any good to incorporate
with the secretary of state and not
[SPEAKER_04]: develop any bylaws and never hold any
meetings because that corporation will be
[SPEAKER_04]: pierced.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a doctrine known as piercing the
corporate veil, which would basically go
[SPEAKER_04]: from the immunity from civil liability to
civil liability for the individual owners
[SPEAKER_04]: if they don't follow the corporate form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no one size fits all,
but I will say that our firm tends to
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer California corporations,
largely for the reasons that Omar has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives a level of protection for the
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a certain amount of formality
that people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at most of the investors,
they know corporations down pat,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're a little less sure what a
partnership actually is or what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporations allow you to bulk up on
shareholders, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to manage a business that has
multiple shareholders of your corporation
[SPEAKER_01]: than, say, a limited liability company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my last companies had 12,000
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one had 50,000 shareholders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were publicly traded, but it does
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we like California because we have
this belief, rightly or wrongly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it will help us if there is ever
litigation because we almost certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: will end up in a California court rather
than, say, a Delaware court.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that there's a tendency towards
Delaware law because those courts are very
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable, smart judges, and there's
lots of jurisprudence that you can call
[SPEAKER_01]: upon so you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't want to be in Delaware.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because cannabis is still
illegal in Delaware.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess for a hemp-derived CBD products
company, I think Delaware may be a viable
[SPEAKER_04]: option in terms of going public in the
future because it's just something that
[SPEAKER_04]: the market understands.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I analyze that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so we actually looked at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Scott may want to chime in as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we looked at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the fact that, yes,
there is no cannabis law in the books in
[SPEAKER_05]: Delaware, that's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, there's also,
I don't believe, a hemp law on the books.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, you'd be hoping that federal
law sort of makes its way down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think when you look at all this,
even on the hemp side, our attorneys have
[SPEAKER_05]: advised to stay in a state that expressly
has legal hemp rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add an additional
complexity in terms of organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in both cannabis and we're in hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of federal banking laws,
a lot of different compliance issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more compliance in cannabis,
we found that we had to keep those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies completely separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, if you're in hemp,
that could affect your lending on other
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of going through that right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be interesting to get you guys'
take on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking you could have an
intellectual property holding company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're going to have one brand
with one pillar of that brand is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be this hemp company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other pillar of the brand is going
to be a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're going to have the same
branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to have that synergistic
influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you probably want to structure it so
that they're basically licensing the brand
[SPEAKER_04]: from an independent IP holding company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that goes back to your initial
question of how would you end up
[SPEAKER_04]: structuring it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do see that the intellectual property
tends to reside within the IP holding
[SPEAKER_04]: company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a whole bunch of other
holding companies potentially for the
[SPEAKER_04]: property ownership and equipment leases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then license out to the more
regulated, the other regulated entities
[SPEAKER_05]: operate basically in silos with going up
to the holdings company at the IP level.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use organizational groups for all
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be very strategic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're particularly interesting in
the regulated cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're all aware of the
restrictions that so many places have on
[SPEAKER_01]: alienation of the licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alienation of the licenses and the
permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the localities are way worse
than the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to change something at Bellflower,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use organizational groupings
for a really, really good purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add one other thing that's not so
much corporate formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just dropped into my mind when
talking about the forum of dispute
[SPEAKER_01]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a big fan of arbitration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbitration in every single commercial
agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbitration in every single share purchase
agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arbitration in employment agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still enforceable here in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of good reasons for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two that probably matter most to this
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is you can almost by contract
shape the kinds of disputes and the kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of remedies available to the parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have tremendous power to get
exactly what you want in a given
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other is it's completely private.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in front of someone pretty much
of your own choosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're worried about being in front
of a 75-year-old who is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dead set against what you do and think you
are evil coming into the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really strike them for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can choose your arbiter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the industry gets older and we have
a working experience, we'll get to know
[SPEAKER_01]: who the arbitrators are who give all of
you a fair shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other reason why arbitration is so
appealing and why so many cannabis or
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp-derived CBD agreements have
arbitration clauses is because the justice
[SPEAKER_04]: system is broken when it comes to
resolution of civil disputes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes approximately seven years to get
from filing of a complaint to a judgment
[SPEAKER_04]: in California just because the criminal
case is take precedence.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have all sorts of deadlines and time
limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't get prosecuted within the
speedy trial rights, then the prosecution
[SPEAKER_04]: has to be dismissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And therefore, in custody criminal cases
basically go to the front of the judicial
[SPEAKER_04]: processing order.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes like years to get justice in
the California courts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a big reason why arbitration is
becoming increasingly more common in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have like private disputes with
dispute resolution companies like Jams.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have cannabis aware neutrals,
whereas for a long time even finding
[SPEAKER_04]: neutrals that were aware of cannabis was
very difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough about laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take it maybe 30,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about brands, ops,
formation.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the interesting dynamics happening
I think is that you're seeing different
[SPEAKER_05]: types of entrance into the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see folks that are essentially sort of
wellness brands coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, working off that ethos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're also seeing cannabis
brands who understand the space and
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously are looking for diversification
because they've got resources that are
[SPEAKER_05]: really conducive to hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see these two factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two factors come in and sort of
clash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just interestingly wanted to hear your
guys' opinions on how that landscape is
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna look of CBD companies sort of
globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: My perspective, starting out as a cannabis
company and moving into hemp, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cannabis companies that are
diversifying into hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the distribution's different,
but selling CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hemp flower, hemp terpenes,
we're seeing a lot of people in the camps
[SPEAKER_00]: who will try to get into that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we're considering
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of growth in the
hemp industry because a lot of the people
[SPEAKER_04]: who are afraid of euphoria, that
undesirable side effect of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: are completely okay with CBD and with the
hemp effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think there's many, whoever
wanted cannabis is already a consumer is
[SPEAKER_04]: my belief.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's many people who are trying to
transition from all these opioid pain
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines who will find tremendous relief
in CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a tremendous growth market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have the boomer population
that is now looking for alternatives to
[SPEAKER_04]: opioid painkillers and alternatives to the
whole pharmaceutical cocktails that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're being prescribed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're looking for one alternative
herbal solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do see, I mean I think we haven't
really, it's hard to predict now what it's
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna look like, but we're gonna see a lot
more innovation, especially as there's
[SPEAKER_04]: different formulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna see cannabis drinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't really seen the full
development of cannabis drinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like 10 years ago, it would be
difficult to predict that the vape
[SPEAKER_04]: cartridges would be one of the biggest
segments of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think now it's difficult to predict what
the next big segment will be, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna involve technology and technological
innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will and then it's a super dynamic
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's off 35% in the last three
months, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So room for new innovative products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that it'll be a confluence of
folks coming from different sectors that
[SPEAKER_05]: bring different viewpoints and different
stories that they can create.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can craft to I think different
segments of the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have time for maybe one
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again for Dean and Omar and
Ken and Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's got one question?
[SPEAKER_03]: One.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all the way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never fails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I stand in the back, they're in
the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I stand in the front,
they're in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the law of stoner exercise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a way to make them work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remind you to download the Whova app.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the after party tonight at Pier 23.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are not expecting outside...
Closer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not expecting outside investors
or don't need outside investors,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you still recommend having a California
corporation over an LLC if you are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp space as a farmer or in the cannabis
space as a farmer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the lawyers go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that you can keep your
membership down below say 35?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are pros and cons either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a very lawyerly answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably isn't the most important
decision on your plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're already an LLC, you probably
should just continue to be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Operating agreements are very flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives you a lot of ability to
have the corporate affairs, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: match your business interests perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably should just stay where you
are, I would think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the big appeal of an LLC is
streamlined corporate governance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in California, we have a statutory
entity called a closed corporation that
[SPEAKER_04]: also offers streamlined corporate
governance in a corporate form.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's also an option to consider
would be like a closed corporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And many wine companies in Sonoma County,
my home county, are closed corporations
[SPEAKER_04]: like all the wineries and the wine
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because they're very easy to manage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really have to follow all of the
formalities of the corporate form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: My two cents is I'm with Ken.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not taking on a bunch of
investors, LLC is easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all very much once again for
Dean and Scott and Omar.
