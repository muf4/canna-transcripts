[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now discussing what needs to happen
in regard of educating doctors and
[SPEAKER_06]: patients so that patients will benefit
from cannabis therapies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a really nice panel here with Dr.
Julian Bichmann, CEO and founder of
[SPEAKER_06]: AlgeaCare, a doctor himself, and he had
just told me when he did his academics in
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine, the endogaine cannabinoid system
was still something which was handled in
[SPEAKER_06]: how many minutes, Julian?
45.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was like 10 minutes and it never
came up again, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and now he's educating other doctors
with AlgeaCare himself, and we are looking
[SPEAKER_06]: forward to get more insight about that
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Daniel Gauchi, Chief Business
Developer of Juicy Fields, and he is a
[SPEAKER_06]: very interesting he has very interesting
insights from the patient perspective
[SPEAKER_06]: because in his family he had been
struggling to get cannabis therapy in
[SPEAKER_06]: different European countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking forward to get this
first-hand educational insights from
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, I hope I spell his name right,
Bozo Radizic, founder of the Research
[SPEAKER_06]: Nature Institute in Slovenia, and he is
struggling or not struggling, we will
[SPEAKER_06]: learn afterwards, to educate doctors and
patients in the Balkan region.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only Slovenia, he has just been
initiating a program in charge of the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical chamber of Slovenia and is
providing and educating doctors so that
[SPEAKER_06]: they do know how to use medical cannabis
when they're in therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we look back four years, we heard
numbers in Germany about 800,000 potential
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those numbers were based on Canadian
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nowadays, we are around how many?
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no official numbers because we
only know GKV and the amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: Selbstzahler is currently, so private
payers is increasing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't know how many patients there
are actually, but it should be around
[SPEAKER_06]: 100,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what you guess, Julian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would guess there's a total,
so all combined, of about 200,000 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 250,000 patients right now in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but still far behind these potential
of 800,000 who actually could benefit from
[SPEAKER_06]: a cannabis therapy or who might benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do you think are the reasons?
[SPEAKER_06]: With Algea Care, you're already working
with 3,000, you already have 3,000
[SPEAKER_06]: patients, and you're working with 40
doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the main reasons that we still
like not all patients who might be
[SPEAKER_06]: relevant for this therapy get access?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think there's a couple key
learnings that we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, coming from university
medicine, it's very humbling and
[SPEAKER_04]: motivating to see the type of
breakthroughs you can have in these
[SPEAKER_04]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are chronic patients,
and often within four to eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, this is the best I've ever
felt, and both in reduction of symptoms,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also reduction of side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing is, I think cannabis is
complex from a medical perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: so obviously there's a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing that we, I think,
did differently, and it worked out pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: well, was to go the hard route and really
think what are all the questions that
[SPEAKER_04]: could come up from patients, from doctors,
from everybody else, and try to be in a
[SPEAKER_04]: position to answer them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the usual medical mantra is to
say, okay, I write a prescription as a
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor, and then that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, everything that happens after is not
my concern, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't work for cannabis,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of questions, even in
Germany, which is, I think, very advanced
[SPEAKER_04]: in Europe, about, okay, can I drive a car,
what about the pharmacies, how should I
[SPEAKER_04]: take medical cannabis, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's where we pride ourselves
and provide a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number, I think, that we're asking or
thinking is that about 2% of doctors in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany have ever, so even including a
single one, treated a patient with medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, that is a small fraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think from a doctor perspective,
there's multiple issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, medicine tends to be
slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, this has been 2017,
and I think this crowd, for them it has
[SPEAKER_04]: been a long time, for doctors,
it has not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four years in medicine is nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still learning about every basic
medication that has been around for
[SPEAKER_04]: decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're learning about side effects and
long-term effects now, these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's, so obviously there's also
things that doctors get wrong and just
[SPEAKER_04]: have their personal thoughts, as with
patients and politicians also,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they just don't think of cannabis as
a medicine, because it doesn't come in a
[SPEAKER_04]: pill, it's not available in all
pharmacies, and there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: research in a way of phase four trial,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there were some good discussions
yesterday, and there's also not pharma
[SPEAKER_04]: reps coming to them and saying,
this is the type, but there's reps coming,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not from pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously there's a different
interpretation of those visits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in Germany, it's just way too
complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both cannabis is complex in a way of,
you need to know all types of strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: are available in the pharmacy,
and right now there's like 80,
[SPEAKER_04]: and not one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes it hard for doctors anyhow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's heavily regulated, it's narcotic
prescription.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, not all doctors use narcotic
prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them, and that's a pretty
significant share, just don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: type of prescriptions in their offices.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, I've never needed it in
the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to go that route.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a lot of questions that
are non-medical that could come back to
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to say, cannabis patients are
also not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are chronic patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a long history of disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've tried a lot of medications.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not patients that you could see
in like three minutes and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right, this is the type of medication
that we're going to do and continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last point really is just
bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's attached to it, especially when it
comes to reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big burden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have good reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's at least three columns
that are in the way of more doctors
[SPEAKER_04]: treating patients with medical cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should not forget that Germany
within the EU is by far the leading
[SPEAKER_06]: country in regard of patient numbers and
market size of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Bonjour, we are very interested if you
could give us insights about the Balkan
[SPEAKER_06]: region and what the main obstacles are
there, how many patients really get access
[SPEAKER_06]: to the therapy, and how much doctors know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot tell exactly for the Balkan
region because as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the ex Yugoslavia countries,
it's allowed even for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Slovenia, since three years,
a doctor can prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hardly find a doctor who is
willing to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two doctors on pediatric clinics
in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: For epilepsy, and I think that's it in
whole Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they imported less than 100
grams of THC for whole Slovenia for the
[SPEAKER_00]: year 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you try to change this
situation and what makes it so difficult
[SPEAKER_06]: for you to really educate doctors?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that cannabis is not the
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, medicament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the doctors, they didn't learn anything
about it through their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only reason they don't want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided years ago to educate also
public and professional public doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we organized until now, I think,
eight conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one was recognized also as
official education for doctors,
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least they have now some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is there were just,
I think, 22 doctors on this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's factor 10 if you currently only
have two doctors prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least it's going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's factor 10, but still with seven times
a thousand doctors in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 20, it's almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel, so those two just told us from the
doctor perspective how tough it is to
[SPEAKER_06]: really reach out to the doctors and get
knowledge through past knowledge to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have been struggling to find medical
help for your family members who are
[SPEAKER_06]: basically patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you experience the same thing,
that it's super hard to find someone,
[SPEAKER_06]: to find a doctor who has this kind of
knowledge which is necessary to help?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, it's two steps of the fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: At first, it was to treat my son.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's severely autistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we decided with a physician privately
to go down the CBD additive route.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was very hard to find when we were
living in Malta at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found it hard not only to find somebody
to talk with us to see how the benefits
[SPEAKER_05]: were against if there was any side effects
or any negative connotations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to research that online.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to have conversations with people
from the US, from London, and other
[SPEAKER_05]: European countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we found out that it was a viable
treatment, the next step was actually
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to find the products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, in certain European countries,
we're having problems with CBD being
[SPEAKER_05]: classed as a food additive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it with the medicinal authority or is
it with the food agencies?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was the first issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We overcome this quite simply by just
simply ordering from abroad.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second issue was a bit more pressing
and a bit more difficult to solve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our daughter got diagnosed with a Wilm
tumor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an aggressive cancer normally
attached to the kidney.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she had that just before her second
birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, straight away, I suppose the same as
most countries, you're admitted to
[SPEAKER_05]: hospital, they do the tests, and you're
not going anywhere for six months if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: chemo, radiation, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd been in the medicinal cannabis
industry for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before my daughter had that, so although I
was aware of how to solve it, the avenues
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't there for us to go and solve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first meeting with the oncology team
and the surgical team was, I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_05]: it was aggressive, but it was negative
towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chief oncologist actually stated,
and this is only 2018, he actually said,
[SPEAKER_05]: he sneered and said there was not enough
studies or information to justify even
[SPEAKER_05]: trying medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This actually shook me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually got me quite defensive and
quite aggressive back because I knew this
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, the anesthetist actually
stepped in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was more involved with new drugs,
new therapies.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was even looking at psychedelics even
back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we found a bit more positivity and
a little more acceptance in trying to help
[SPEAKER_05]: our daughter, the treatment we were going
for that was set down for her was at first
[SPEAKER_05]: radiotherapy, followed by chemotherapy,
and then followed by surgery.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were concerned at every point during
this that we weren't allowed to have the
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we contacted a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to order it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we found a really good supplier in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it was the Germans who were
really open to our case.
[SPEAKER_05]: They spoke with the medical team
themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to send it mysteriously
packaged and to a different address as the
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyer advised.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were quite scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it was an easy decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go there straight away as a parent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think anybody in the room would agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd do anything, especially as we all
know how safe medicinal cannabis is at the
[SPEAKER_05]: moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the lawyer just told us to go
ahead anyway and do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But going back through that, it was such a
process to overcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the time we lost doing that,
it made the condition worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week, she was getting worse and
sorry, until we could actually find a
[SPEAKER_05]: cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the doctors in Germany actually
came over to Malta and they brought it
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves as well, and it actually
helped.
[SPEAKER_05]: The anesthetist actually took the tumor
away for biopsies after.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, he hasn't got the results
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually been two years and he still
is not allowed access to the results of
[SPEAKER_05]: the biopsy because he sent it away
privately as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from that moment on, it was quite well
known in Malta what we'd done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we then saw where the education levels
were throughout the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patients, doctors, suppliers, politicians,
even myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd been in the industry for 10 years and
didn't realize how difficult it was for
[SPEAKER_05]: some of these parents to access treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So since then, that's what we've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been trying to help parents get
treatment for their kids in no matter what
[SPEAKER_05]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm in a position to help.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen doors opening left,
right and center.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's crazy because that
level of rejection of doctors is something
[SPEAKER_04]: that is still very much present in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they come to Algea Care,
they're often surprised that this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: first time that they can talk to doctors
who have the knowledge and you're not put
[SPEAKER_04]: in a defensive position.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's everywhere in the EU.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I would have done to have a company
like you back then three years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then to see the change actually over
the past three, four years, the evolution
[SPEAKER_05]: is rapid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are really opening up and there
seems to be like an arms race now to help
[SPEAKER_05]: parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do believe it's parents and patients
that are pushing that legislation forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if we look at the UK, it was
legalized, but nobody was prescribing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took the parents of a small child going
to parliament and getting public support.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what pushed the legislation
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't pharmaceutical lobbying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't hardly any, well, yes,
of course that's always involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do believe it was the media
coverage, mainstream media coverage,
[SPEAKER_05]: positive content and positive,
oh sorry, I called it positive product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Propaganda, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel told me that he hadn't been on
stage for two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it's very important that
you're back and provide this information
[SPEAKER_06]: in public.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also some kind of education and
part of the whole process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Julian, Daniel mentioned something very
interesting that there is like these
[SPEAKER_06]: anecdotals where you see it helps,
but then you hear from the medical experts
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes the argument that they still
consider a lack of evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So clinical research evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: How much evidence is there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a valid argument or do we still
need to push really for big research?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how should this happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because everyone knows it's super
complicated to get patents for natural
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's incentivized to actually push for
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe you can give us insight about
the evident situation regarding medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have even more experts in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll keep it brief so we can maybe
split this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing is because obviously we
reviewed all the literature when we
[SPEAKER_04]: started and we keep doing that on a weekly
basis, is that obviously there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: literature out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis has been around for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think doctors are new to the idea that
medicine is a natural product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't come in a pill.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't come into use by sales reps and
just the traditional phase one to phase
[SPEAKER_04]: four cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't apply to cannabis because
there's not one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's a very new approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're seeing pharmaceutical
companies get into that space,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think is good for the whole space
because it brings a level of
[SPEAKER_04]: accreditation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, they're also pushing
against in some extents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't see a phase four trial of a
specific cannabis strain or product coming
[SPEAKER_04]: in the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're also limiting yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're seeing with patients
actually is that we are very pro flower
[SPEAKER_04]: because you have a bigger arsenal of
different strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You tend to have better quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard about quality in the last talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually see more patients
switching from extracts to flowers than
[SPEAKER_04]: the other way around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that I think is just new to doctors
because the application is so different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we should follow up on the
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I may just add, you know, cannabis is
the most research plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't want to see evidence,
you will not see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how can you act and make doctors see
evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard because it's hard to find a
doctor who wants to be exposed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the mainstream medical
system is still very much against
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, at least in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a chance to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the regulations,
but they don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even in hospice, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually just two, three doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think just through education and
maybe personal stories like his,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be some changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think when it comes to research,
it's also about how you want to conduct
[SPEAKER_04]: that research, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard yesterday also from the great
politician panel that they want to do more
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we've seen in Germany is the
way if you put money into a federal
[SPEAKER_04]: agency, the output will be somewhat
limited.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the BFARM study,
which had the most data of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: patients in Germany ever, the result was
that a big portion of these patients
[SPEAKER_04]: dropped out of therapy because they died.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is not a realistic
representation of who cannabis patients
[SPEAKER_04]: are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis patients are not as majority
pre-final, close to a death.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think the narrative there is
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we need to do is ease the
access to cannabis for research purposes,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I can tell you a lot of
universities would dive in if it was
[SPEAKER_04]: easier to do that type of research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think you're going to get also
the level of quality that you need with
[SPEAKER_04]: that research.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you run it only through state agencies,
I think the impact will be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add, you know, the system
will have to do something because people
[SPEAKER_00]: will use cannabis even without the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore we decided years ago to
establish the laboratory where people can
[SPEAKER_00]: at least test their products, which they
buy on the, unfortunately, black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like there needs to be done a
lot of patient education because in many
[SPEAKER_06]: cases it's more patients pushing their
doctors towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, because especially parents of
epileptic or autistic children,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they can read, they can Google
it, and they don't understand that doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of parents contacting me on
social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, there was a group of
grandparents and they'd gone to the
[SPEAKER_05]: supermarket to buy hemp seed oil,
you know, for the salad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're asking me how much dosage they
should give them in order.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the education really needs from all
aspects, especially from the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the guys that I know in Malta,
for example, to get your license in Malta,
[SPEAKER_05]: a patient license, you have to get now
four doctors to sign off on it,
[SPEAKER_05]: all from one place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the pain clinic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to be in physical pain or
dying to get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the doctor, he's very well aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of the pro cannabis and he's the
one who actually got it this far.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's so restrictive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend, he's an amputee.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a lot of other issues with his
muscles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he really qualifies on all levels
through all countries with all doctors on
[SPEAKER_05]: every level to get a prescription for
medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he had a court case eight years ago
where he got caught with a joint at a
[SPEAKER_05]: party and that automatically the
application automatically gets rejected
[SPEAKER_05]: with any kind of criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there needs to be a distinction
as well between any kind of criminal
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational background and somebody
trying to get medicine for them to move
[SPEAKER_05]: forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that needs to be taken out
straight away at the legislation level.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you deny somebody medicine for
something totally unrelated?
[SPEAKER_05]: And years ago, it just makes no sense to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And breaking that narrative with
education, both on a patient, on a doctor,
[SPEAKER_04]: on a politician level is also,
cannabis is not only for final stages,
[SPEAKER_04]: not only for autistic patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what we see is a majority of our
patients is pain patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of ADHD patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: These patients are at the end of their
treatment options by the end age of mid
[SPEAKER_04]: 20s often with their PCP telling them
basically there's nothing else we can do,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a tough not to swallow really,
I think at that age.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so bringing that knowledge in that
cannabis helps with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_04]: diseases and also goes through all age
groups with everything from 18 to 80 plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a narrative that doctors
will also respond to because it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: being fed to them at the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just mentioned politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So which other stakeholders are there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doctors doesn't seem to be well motivated
to actually be proactive and use medical
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients on the other side seem to be
European patients seem to be a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: desperate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Politics makes regulation as complicated
as possible to not incentivize doctors at
[SPEAKER_06]: all to spend their time on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what kind of stakeholders we have,
other insurers, how do we get in touch
[SPEAKER_06]: with this?
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like we need a multi touch point
strategy with politics, making it smoother
[SPEAKER_06]: for doctors and initiating something with
universities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which other stakeholders we have?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can also talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how should we involve those
stakeholders in this educational process?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should involve all of the participants
in this cannabis area because doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: should listen also to stories like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should go through the medical records
of many patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the biggest problem is really
in Europe bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is over regulated and cannabis
is the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it is food, if it is not
food, if it is medicine or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it is illicit drug or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really crazy in this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would actually contradict what you
said, Moritz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that cannabis patients are
desperate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're one of the most well
informed patient groups I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: encountered because they're really the
guardian of their own disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've tried everything else and that
leads them to cannabis often.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see people doing, you know,
diaries on a daily basis, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a doctor, that's actually the
patients you want because they're taking
[SPEAKER_04]: control of their health and they're
working together with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not saying, hey, the doctor
prescribed me this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just do it and then maybe complain
with side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what you mentioned about the
stakeholders is that obviously everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: in healthcare just has a lot of
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody has a different position with
different requirements and also
[SPEAKER_04]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think talking about insurers,
both statutory, the GKV and also private
[SPEAKER_04]: insurers, I don't think the way is to say,
to kind of push on them and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, this is medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that hasn't worked in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we're seeing over the last
four years in Germany, our approach when
[SPEAKER_04]: educating everybody is data driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a language that,
you know, it's hard to contradict and is
[SPEAKER_04]: easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're seeing with cannabis is
both the breakthroughs, so really the
[SPEAKER_04]: patient outcomes are, let's maybe focus on
pain patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of patients coming away from
opioids with all the side effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So looking at clinical outcome,
looking at how are these patients doing
[SPEAKER_04]: and doing that data driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really with scales and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because that is still,
I think, kind of not a gray zone in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany, but not fully transparent is the
cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bringing transparency into the cost of
the treatment, both on a patient level,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also on a statutory insurer's level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And reducing that cost over time because
that's what's holding back insurers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Insurers look at outcome and they look at
cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's how we need to modify
the dialogue and then we're going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: good advances.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we run a calculation, opioid versus
cannabis, and then we see side effects,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera, it might be that insurers
suddenly open their eyes and say,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, that's indeed, that's not so
expensive if we consider the complete
[SPEAKER_06]: picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the way is, and that's also the
route that we're taking with research,
[SPEAKER_04]: is to show, all right, let's look at a
couple hundred pain patients together with
[SPEAKER_04]: university partners and look at cannabis
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then really break down, let's say,
within a year, what was the outcome?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was all the associated costs?
[SPEAKER_04]: So doing real cost effective study,
all the doctor visits, MRIs that you got,
[SPEAKER_04]: hospitalizations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you bring down the cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you only look at what does it cost in
the pharmacy every four weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, that's blocking out
everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that data hasn't been available
yet because research was limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even if we look at costs only for
flowers, we see dropping prices,
[SPEAKER_06]: drastically dropping price at least here
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel, maybe you can tell us,
do you think that these kind of dropping
[SPEAKER_06]: prices will also lead to more acceptance
and more willingness to actually use the
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it depends on the model the
government, each government have in terms
[SPEAKER_05]: of patient costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if everything comes down,
we like, from my point of view,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to associate the cost powers,
but you can't ignore it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the countries that the price
points at are at the minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some local health authorities don't have
the budgets to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something in the UK called the
postcode lottery.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just depends where you live,
whether that local authority has the
[SPEAKER_05]: budget for your medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not, you can move to the next town
that maybe does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think it will have a big
difference when the prices start coming
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_06]: The relevant of lower prices for the
acceptance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there should be any question
about the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have such expensive
therapies, which are so ineffective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no excuse not to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with broader use of cannabis,
we all know that cannabis reduces stress
[SPEAKER_00]: and stress induces so many conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, we should, doctors should
prescribe more cannabis and there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: much less need for another
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Julien, I would like to get back to the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can give us more insight about
education at universities.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something we didn't talk about at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if doctors haven't, didn't learn
anything during their time at university,
[SPEAKER_06]: how should they catch up?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your experience there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my medical experience was about 15,
10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you that we actually heard
about the endocannabinoid system in
[SPEAKER_04]: biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, when you're still pre-med,
you haven't seen any patients yet,
[SPEAKER_04]: only dead ones on the section table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took like 10 minutes and it never
came up again because everybody laughed at
[SPEAKER_04]: the time and was like, oh, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it never came up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that education is still
missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see more private efforts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see small meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: My main issue with education when it comes
to medical cannabis as a doctor,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we ran into the same issue,
was everybody gives talks about my first
[SPEAKER_04]: patient, but no one gives a talk about my
hundred, my thousand patients because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's where a lot of questions actually
come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is more easy than when you
have hundreds of patients because a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different questions come in and you need
to be an expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's challenging as a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to, so for example, our doctors
on average prescribe in follow-up patients
[SPEAKER_04]: or patients that had at least one
appointment, they prescribe actually 1.6
[SPEAKER_04]: types of strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So more than one on average.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have patients on two or three
different strains, not with a high dose
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think that mantra also has to be
broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a high dose, but it's a
different strain in the morning versus in
[SPEAKER_04]: the evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that knowledge shows you that I think
to be a good cannabis doctor, you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: become an expert in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something you can do with like a
weekend seminar and then you're ready for
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to learn along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Slovenia, how is the situation at
university?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you learn something about endogaine?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't have in their curriculum at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is actually no education about
endocannabinoid system or cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be important to say,
we talk a lot about the doctors,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I think pharmacists and pharmacology,
we'd have a better hit result there
[SPEAKER_05]: because they're the guys that study the
drug interactions a lot more.
[SPEAKER_05]: They see, well not a lot more,
but they see the crossovers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if there was more emphasis on the
maybe microbiology sectors of the segments
[SPEAKER_05]: of the pharmaceutical courses,
and then that will trickle down because
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacists and doctors do work hand in
hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think pharmacists have a lot of
influence.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if there was more focus in
pharmacology, that would help with the
[SPEAKER_05]: education in a lot of other different
areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so it's too difficult to get access
to doctors directly, better push politics,
[SPEAKER_06]: make smoother regulation and then push
pharmacists to educate them which strain
[SPEAKER_06]: and which flow and which purpose because
they're in the dialogue with the patient
[SPEAKER_06]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we see increasing numbers of
strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it make it even more difficult for
pharmacists and for doctors to understand
[SPEAKER_06]: what they should choose?
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to maybe add, we should try to
figure out if they teach it in pharmacy
[SPEAKER_04]: school, because I actually don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be the same issue as a medical
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think doctors, the number of strains is
only a smaller part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: How to prescribe it, and this is not going
to be super popular, but the naming of the
[SPEAKER_04]: products and the easiness of, all right,
as a doctor, I have within 30 seconds,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand the portfolio of that
company because it has THC, CD levels in
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy for me to understand what's the
heritage of the strain and where the
[SPEAKER_04]: applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you firsthand, doctors,
at least at the beginning, are
[SPEAKER_04]: uncomfortable prescribing medication that
has white widow in it or glue or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just reality, and I'm still amazed
that the industry tends to set the rules
[SPEAKER_04]: here instead of trying to enlarge in that
model to market, talk with doctors,
[SPEAKER_04]: and figure out, hey, what's the easiest
way that we could name this product so you
[SPEAKER_04]: get it, you understand it, and the
patients get it, and it doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_04]: weird side vibe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, one last question.
[SPEAKER_06]: End of last year, the UN reclassified
cannabis, rescheduled it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think, do you see already effect of
this reclassification on the acceptance in
[SPEAKER_06]: European countries?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this will happen,
or do you think until cannabinoid-based
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine is really accepted, we need to
wait for standardized product because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: just too complex to educate all the
different players?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we will have it as soon as
possible, you know, all the approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid medicine, but it depends
really from our bureaucrats and
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now in the process of changing the
law about growing and producing and
[SPEAKER_00]: processing the cannabis for medical
purposes, and I hope it will happen very
[SPEAKER_00]: quick in Slovenia, and then we will have
more answers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And has this decision by the Slovenian
government been influenced by the
[SPEAKER_06]: reclassification?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think so, and I think that the good
thing is that the guy who took over all
[SPEAKER_00]: the new law and everything is not from the
cannabis field and not from pharma field,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he has completely different angle of
view and things are going good way,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's a reaffirmation that was
long overdue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more like Daniel said,
that changing policy involves the people,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they need to be outspoken.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's part of the process,
but it's not 100% part by far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to agree in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Juicy Fields we noticed a big increase
in community farmers actually wanting to
[SPEAKER_05]: jump on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't just the patient level,
it was people wanting to provide,
[SPEAKER_05]: either whether it was CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as the UN changed the legislation,
you could see a lot more interest,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it would be actually interesting to
see the Google searches and everything
[SPEAKER_05]: went up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'd say interest really peaked
at that time, especially January,
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a lot more correspondence with a
lot more different people, from patients
[SPEAKER_05]: to small community cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're well optimistic that the process
in the EU will be accelerated?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at events like this,
and the diverse amount of opportunities in
[SPEAKER_05]: the different sectors within this
industry, everybody's hungry, everybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: pushing it from so many different angles,
and with all being in the EU, I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think that can be stopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe a lot, okay, we have the EU
guidelines, but each country has their
[SPEAKER_05]: sovereign laws and everything,
and I think collectively that's all moving
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: The motivations behind that, I don't know,
is that some countries not wanting to be
[SPEAKER_05]: left behind, some countries want to go
into maybe medical marijuana tourism,
[SPEAKER_05]: now that the tourism might be affected.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the whole industry,
I'm sorry, all the sectors across the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry will be positively growing from
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Julian, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we need to wait for standardized
cannabinoid-based medicine, or what will
[SPEAKER_06]: happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's hard to do, because even if
in Germany, although it's a federal law,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see differences in the different
states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think politicians can do part of the
journey, but not 100%, and then it's more
[SPEAKER_04]: about patients speaking out, doctors
speaking out, educating themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be surprised, because what we have
seen within the last four years,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that everything in cannabis industries
goes slower than we accept.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we are always a bit unpatient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then things take a while, and now it
looks like that the EU might be a core
[SPEAKER_06]: piece in the puzzle of educating for
cannabis and harmonizing the rules on
[SPEAKER_06]: European level, and I don't know if the EU
is well known for speed, let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't even have harmonized rules in
Germany, and I don't know, in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_06]: it looks like also that the harmonization
is not that well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's see how fast things go,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we look out for some questions,
maybe?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have a couple of questions,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, this is more of a statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, Cialis is also a made-up name,
and so is Viagra.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, trainwreck, white widow,
to me, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm thinking on the, when it comes to,
when you're talking about how to prescribe
[SPEAKER_07]: the dosages, it's really more about the
terpene profile, I think, for more people
[SPEAKER_07]: now, because we find that the terpenes do
different things, more than just the THC,
[SPEAKER_07]: or the CBD, or the CBGEN.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, when you're talking to the doctors,
you might want to mention they might want
[SPEAKER_07]: to look into Mersene, or look into beta
carofaline, and the effects, and that sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it would make it easier for them to
prescribe certain things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're very much pro-looking at
terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not there yet that you can really
use it to influence the therapy,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's just, with every batch,
it's different, and you don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: data available.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every person's different, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the biggest problem, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the way to really make this
accessible for all patients in Germany is
[SPEAKER_04]: to take the guessing out, make it a little
bit less individualized, because then it
[SPEAKER_04]: will be easier, and then you'll
automatically have more patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the situation in Germany is that even
if it's registered under a single number,
[SPEAKER_04]: PZN, you may have different strains,
and you have to put that on the
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for doctors, it needs to be easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to be, this is the number.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can put this in my system, and then it's
in there, because the process of
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribing is otherwise too long,
or leads to too many follow-up questions
[SPEAKER_04]: from the pharmacy or patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might be a good point to say...
Everyone else has questions, finally!
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally!
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a busy session, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been talking a lot about
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most important points for
sure, but I posed a question a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: days ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a big problem in the current study
situation we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now five years, almost five years
into, in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seen almost no progress in terms
of studies since 2015-16.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a solid situation in terms of
pain, in terms of plasticity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been talking about autism.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been talking about ADHD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been talking, maybe, about IBD,
Inflammatory Bowel Disease, is
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are treating patients like this,
and we are seeing results, interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: results, but we are not going to have a
lot of doctors prescribing if there is not
[SPEAKER_03]: a solid study situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the legal situation,
we are all working off-label.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no guidelines to rely on,
so this is a major problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we can educate, and it's very
important, but if we are not getting
[SPEAKER_03]: better studies, it's going to be very
difficult to find more doctors who will be
[SPEAKER_03]: able, or who want to work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not because they don't know,
or they don't win money with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: just because of the legal situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to pose the question,
who do you see in the responsibility?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we live in a society where this
all relies on big pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big pharma pays for studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the results, and doctors prescribe
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in terms here, we have not seen this
step from the big medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industries, and we are able to sell it at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody did the step to do the studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think I would like to know from you
at the panel, what is your opinion on
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who do you see in the responsibility at
this point, after so many years of already
[SPEAKER_03]: working with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who should be, or who should pay for those
studies?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would actually disagree to some extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there has been done a lot of
research, actually also in those five
[SPEAKER_04]: years, maybe not to the level that we're
used to with pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We even have an internal manufacturing
news center, and I see new studies,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least like 10, every month there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a tough one in a way that
not a single one is responsible or can
[SPEAKER_04]: solve the issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe let's phrase it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from a legislature situation,
you need to make it easier to doctors to
[SPEAKER_04]: treat with cannabis, and especially also
doctors working in research facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's narcotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still hard if you say, hey,
I want to do the study.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to get all different
authorizations that otherwise you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think that's their share that they
need to have, and then I think it's a good
[SPEAKER_04]: step actually that pharmaceutical
companies come in and have an interest in
[SPEAKER_04]: getting these studies in there,
and we're seeing these moves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevertheless, I think it's very hard to
say who's to blame, and also who's in the
[SPEAKER_04]: situation to really resolve all those
issues there and with there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you have an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually looking forward to the
dialogue, but it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Leo, and I agree that
there's an issue of who to blame for
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials, but with regard to the
education, there's a really important
[SPEAKER_02]: concept of we have the pieces in front of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just actually finished commissioning
a course that has 200 citations in the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have the information, we have the
studies, we know what the format is,
[SPEAKER_02]: ECS, PKPD, dosage, contra, indications,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the missing link is accreditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, why have there not been more effort,
more money spent on accreditation and
[SPEAKER_02]: content validation?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about who to blame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we need to ask who to trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would like to answer that question?
[SPEAKER_07]: Really more of a statement, yet again.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they haven't solved that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I think everybody's stopped
with the blame game, but then the ball has
[SPEAKER_05]: just been left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wants to take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's so much at stake for
whoever takes it on.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big reward, but I think there's
also big risk.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I believe it's down to, I mean,
personally, I think your own medication is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be personal medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody should be responsible for their
own medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe we're not at that point yet,
but that's the point where we should be
[SPEAKER_05]: aiming for, taking that responsibility
away from pharma companies, in relation to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and medicinal marijuana,
that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think that's the point here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to take either somebody
with very brave to take it on and do it
[SPEAKER_05]: all, or then it has to come down to the EU
or the governments to push it forward,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that will come through the public
pushing that and demanding that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from my academic experience of how to
get into guidelines, it's easy access to
[SPEAKER_04]: run studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't actually think that money is going
to solve it, or it's not going to end up
[SPEAKER_04]: at the people who actually do the
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's make it easier to do research
independently at university hospitals,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera, and then increase the presence
at, you know, not cannabis conferences,
[SPEAKER_04]: but at true medical conferences and say,
hey, these are the results that we have,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's going to open a lot of
eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once the pressure is there,
you're going to get into guidelines and
[SPEAKER_04]: then have also a way to make bigger trials
and multidisciplinary trials, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's the way I don't think coming
through a state-funded system is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: resolve that issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've seen it didn't work out in
the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel, first, thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for sharing your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is regarding the studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have seen how pharma has done their
studies in a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the recent trend, it's more into
real-world evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is, how easy do you see
that we can get into that path?
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, how feasible will be for the
regulatory agencies to consider those data
[SPEAKER_01]: into the formal application for a finished
drug?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a conversation a couple of months
ago regarding something similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a team of doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're already always focused on
cannabis to begin with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never something else specialized,
and then they look at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're always starting from the point of
looking at it from a cannabis point of
[SPEAKER_05]: view.
[SPEAKER_05]: In relation, I think the studies should be
done with the actual patients in a closed
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, and then that data is all
collected and just fed into one central
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once this has been done, this can be done
all over the world, all over Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: and keep being fed into the central point.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I missed the second part of the
question.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we're touching upon
credibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: So any professional body has a credible
background in order to do these studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's reports, and then it goes up
through the chain, depending on what
[SPEAKER_05]: country you're in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where it should start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's the most credible in that country at
that point from the medicine's authority?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if that's real-world
applications, then maybe the private
[SPEAKER_05]: companies be working hand-in-hand with the
government agencies, because it's time and
[SPEAKER_05]: time again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's normally the private companies that
push that innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the applications, the delivery
methods, and all the different ways of
[SPEAKER_05]: activating that therapy and applying that
therapy, if you just think about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's so many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to come up with that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because once that process is in place,
then you can really start to do the
[SPEAKER_05]: studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can make the legislation,
and then it goes mainstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in certain ways, you can see it being
years away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in certain ways, you can see it
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if we can see the steps to make,
then surely they can already.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe that's a really important
point about the real-world applications
[SPEAKER_05]: and how that gets credibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think real-world evidence has a lot
of value.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to make metal cannabis in Germany
easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for doctors, it's confusing to say,
well, it's a hybrid strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has an indica, derivative, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to have more straightforward
groups, because then the research will
[SPEAKER_04]: follow along.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think our approach or how we look at
research is to start with demographics and
[SPEAKER_04]: show average patient, that's the base.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still missing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not 70-plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then move on to general outcomes,
clinical outcomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then move into disease-specific or
maybe even product specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I talk with pharmaceutical companies,
et cetera, they always tend to focus on
[SPEAKER_04]: strain-specific, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like skipping a couple steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I think with the topic itself,
also missing a couple steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a big legislation discussion
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, medical cannabis
patients in Germany are being left alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are still facing a lot of legal
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to take those steps first.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to learn a lot from medical
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that will potentially later on
lead to a better pathway to legalization,
[SPEAKER_04]: if at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we're, again, jumping at least
five steps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that we didn't get to your
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a couple of you had more questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ran out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're way over time already.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of us are very, very hungry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure they would love to talk to
you right here, since we now have an hour,
[SPEAKER_07]: or in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can get all your questions
answered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have food and drink.
[SPEAKER_07]: Downstairs, we'll resume at just about 2 o
'clock right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy your lunch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got new technology for now.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we all have a background.
Nothing is no sound.
If we all live underground, it's now a
virtual insanity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget your virtual reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's nothing so bad.
There's nothing so bad.
Oh, yeah.
I know, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I know it can go on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this virtual insanity we're living in.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, change.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll never be the same in a kindergarten
where we're living in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, virtual insanity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this world has got to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I just, I just can't keep going on
in this virtual, virtual insanity that
[SPEAKER_08]: we're living in, that we're living in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, virtual insanity is what it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just made a virtual insanity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I always seem to be covered by this
love we have for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just twisting up in new technology for
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we all have a background.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you just made a virtual insanity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we always seem to be covered by a
love for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just twisting up in new technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now there is no sound.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we all live underground.
Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

[SPEAKER_08]: Light years ahead will be a new solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Light years away from our duty to
assistance.
