[SPEAKER_00]: You can hardly see police, you know,
embarrassing people for a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember when you went to jail and
there was a movement here in Slovenia to
[SPEAKER_00]: free Božo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, cannabis scientists, we know that
cannabis has no influence on the driving
[SPEAKER_00]: when you are a regular user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your audience thinks
about former Yugoslavia, but former
[SPEAKER_00]: Yugoslavia was not the eastern block.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an important question to ask you,
Božo.
[SPEAKER_02]: How old were you when you first spoke
weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in Slovenia, Ljubljana,
and today we get to interview someone who
[SPEAKER_02]: is very special in terms of the cannabis
industry and the cannabis movement,
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of my best friends in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to welcome the one and
only Božo da Radicic, to the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Božo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm honored to be with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, we're honored to have you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually just having dinner last
night at our favorite place, the
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Božo and I, we like to go out and eat meat
on the grill because that's what we do
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the Balkans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Božo, why don't you just tell us a little
bit about Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just describe in your own words how you
feel about Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe Slovenia to someone
else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia, generally, is a miniature
country, but we have everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have beautiful sea, we have mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Slovenia, you can ski and swim in two
hours difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have still quite healthy environment,
but the only thing we don't have yet in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia is good cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I'm walking around the streets
here in Ljubljana, I see weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually get to smoke my joint with
impunity, it seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived in a lot of different
countries, and though the cannabis policy
[SPEAKER_02]: here needs to modernize for sure,
they say implementation is 90% of the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're on the ground here and
you're smoking weed, some places you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: the cops, you feel this we would call a
police state, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Slovenia, in comparison to all the
other places I've lived on the planet,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does not feel so much like a police
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak to that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, police regarding
cannabis is way more tolerant than our
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucrats because we achieved through
the last 15 years many verdicts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Supreme Court and police is following it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays you cannot find almost any
police who will put charges on some
[SPEAKER_00]: patient who is growing for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hardly see police embarrassing
people for a joint in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can openly smoke almost everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in practice it's way better than in
theory, let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everywhere on the planet you see a
disconnect with where the people are at
[SPEAKER_02]: versus where the politics are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times you'll find the police
are in line with the politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll still be cracking skulls
for... Not in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some data that almost one-third
of Slovenian are using cannabis regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost one-third?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost one-third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also many police is in this
one-third of the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it seems very accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that everybody, when you bring
up, like when I tell people what I do here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Slovenia, everybody's interested and
everybody's curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had nobody say or... I've never
felt... I can hardly think of one example
[SPEAKER_02]: where someone had some visceral recoil
because I told them something that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were just appalled by.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's actually on the contrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are so open in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do you think the public is so...
Because I've lived in other European
[SPEAKER_02]: countries also and it's not like it is in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived in Holland also and it's not as
open for general society.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, it just seems like people really
just don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just know that cannabis is a benign
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just... In general, I think people
don't give a fuck here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is they think you
do your thing, I do my thing, we leave
[SPEAKER_02]: each other alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result of our movement or
let's say activism in the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were mostly focused on the
patients and the sick people, not on the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking milieu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, especially if you have a
lot of scientific data behind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn over the public opinion against
some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already started and one reason is also
because we organized like 10 scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the days when I was in jail,
it was everywhere on the national
[SPEAKER_00]: television, all newspapers, magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when people start to think,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember when you went to jail and
there was a movement here in Slovenia to
[SPEAKER_02]: free Bozo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's still your email domain to this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as far as I know, you went on a
hunger strike in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I went on a hunger strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had opened one old case from 2008,
but I wasn't prosecuted for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2012, they imprisoned me
because of a few plants on my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I openly grow cannabis since,
I don't know, 20 or more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never hid it because you cannot hide a
four meter plant in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew it was very unjust because it
was for actually very small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the judge was, let's say, not very
happy with cannabis because I live in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very rural area on the Hungarian border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the situation there is way different
than in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have a friend, he unfortunately
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him in prison where he got in Mursko
Sobota, a one year prison for one gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a possessions charge or did they
somehow get him for cultivating or
[SPEAKER_02]: distributing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a year for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long ago was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to interject, do you think that
would happen now?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was also unjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that time, it was an abnormal case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very abnormal case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know actually that it
happened until I went to the jail and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the same cell with me and he
presented me the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because cannabis in Slovenia,
let's say 20, 15 years ago, was easy money
[SPEAKER_00]: for police, for prosecutors, for
attorneys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's what I mean about the
police state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually the police or a lot of
jurisdictions, they'll go for that low
[SPEAKER_02]: lying fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did that change?
[SPEAKER_00]: They realized that it's counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am helping people since 2012 when I was
in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that we freed at least 15
or 20 people on the Supreme Court who were
[SPEAKER_00]: already convicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your activism work started setting new
precedents all the way to the Supreme
[SPEAKER_00]: Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky to have a good friend,
very high in this circles, lawyer and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he advised me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was always calling out the human
rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The human rights aspect of why we
should...
[SPEAKER_02]: For prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have... Listen, cannabis is the most
researched plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 150,000 studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means like seven studies a day are
published on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are still imprisoning people
because they want to help themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really crazy because none of those
who were convicted was traffickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always just for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're talking about a lot of
convictions in Slovenia were just for
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivating mostly in possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never trafficking even mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, courts and prosecutors,
they somehow put on the equal scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trafficking is trafficking and possession
is something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it all should be... We
both think it all should be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're looking at it from a legal
lens, clearly one's more benign than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is legal in Slovenia right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legality, it means that we have certain
laws about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it should be regulated more logically
and more towards patient-orientated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could snap your fingers and make
new policy now in Slovenia, what would you
[SPEAKER_02]: do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other countries in Europe or
America or states in America or the world
[SPEAKER_02]: that you see as examples to use for
Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I pick from different countries,
different regulations, we can put
[SPEAKER_00]: something good together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because always something what should not
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's for example, Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They legalized how many?
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year when I was on Cannabfest,
the police is still bothering people for
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a joint on the cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really... Still at
Cannabfest, the police are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I heard they were sometimes at
Coltiv.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in Coltiv, many people are losing
their driver's license because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another issue with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of America when cops used to
just sit outside the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait till the Grateful Dead concerts were
over and just bust people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, cannabis users and cannabis
scientists, let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabis has no influence on
the driving when you are a regular user.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mix it with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's funny you say that because I
think there's two studies done on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a study I think in Jamaica done
about that, driving in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I think that's the dirty
little unknown secret, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that all us cannabis users clearly know
that you're not impaired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a matter of impairment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because I know when I've had
three or four drinks in a couple hours
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe, I know I probably shouldn't drive,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to cannabis,
you just, you know your impairment level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each individual knows their impairment
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was another study done by,
I think it was Sanjay Gupta when he came
[SPEAKER_02]: out with that second CNN.
[SPEAKER_02]: His first one was the Charlotte's Web,
which blew everything up, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which really helped the movement in
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second one, he said,
that was the conclusion is they did an
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment and they had two, I guess you'd
call them test groups, not a control
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was the drivers who had smoked
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because you smoke pot doesn't mean
you're stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was the drivers that smoked pot
that were regular pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the drivers who smoked
pot that were not regular pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And clearly, the drivers that were regular
users were not impaired.
[SPEAKER_02]: They drove perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones who weren't used to cannabis
and were just high as shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like you wouldn't recommend to anyone
who was a novice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, hey, if you're going
to smoke, don't drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think these are like really
interesting, almost esoteric facts in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis world that make cannabis
something like, you know, in alcohol,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can, even in alcohol, there's,
hey, you could have 0.08 in your system
[SPEAKER_02]: and some people will be able to drive
better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are not able with 0.2 in
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the doctor's job is to
determine your impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just because I have metabolites in the
blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I smoke for 47 years now,
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had a car accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoke all the time, you know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can clearly say it doesn't affect
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drive slower, you drive way more
careful, especially than on alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your senses are heightened too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, I was on the parliamentary
committee for health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was also a guy from police,
Ministry of Internal Affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was, you know, giving us some data
on the traffic accident and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alcohol is responsible for more than
30% of all car accidents in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have up to 0.5, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it is in Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't pay a fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later, if you're drunk as hell,
you can get your driver's license back on
[SPEAKER_00]: parole, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pay some fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis or all drugs in Slovenia are
responsible for 0.3% of the all accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pay 1,800 euro fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take your driver's license away.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they take it if you're driving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard in Germany, they take your
driver's license if you just get caught
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis in your system, even if
you're driving or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is another issue, which I hope
that I will soon bring somebody's case to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nowadays also in public services,
public jobs, let's say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: court, police and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not use cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they drug test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is completely against the
Constitution because if you are my
[SPEAKER_00]: employer, it's not your business what I do
outside of my working time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I fulfill my contract with you as an
employer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they add prescription drugs to that
also?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just illicit drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just illicit drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, illicit drugs are more than
400 on the list, but they just check a
[SPEAKER_00]: few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocaine, heroin, and cannabis and
methamphetamines maybe and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but again, here's the crux of the
issue, I think, which is impairment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're driving, are you impaired or
not?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're at work, are you doing a good
job or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you impaired?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of this stuff,
I know a lot of this stuff in America has
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with liability issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've got to put the blame on
someone at some time, the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll basically, you know,
because of liability, they'll have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, well, head of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, even though that's mistaken,
the mistake was made, but we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: associate it with you being impaired.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some maybe other spurious thing that
happened that, well, you've got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drug tested, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but this could be a good employee,
but then the system is compelled to fire
[SPEAKER_02]: them or let them go because of liability
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that similar in Slovenia at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I generally know they don't have
quite as much liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe is very, very, very strange on this
issue of cannabis and drugs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because Europe have a big bureaucrats
system and it's divided from Europe to the
[SPEAKER_00]: national.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europe is not a good example for
anything on the field of drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are some bright lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just talk about drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are bright lights like
Malta now, Germany, especially because
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is very strong country and
European Union, Luxembourg and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference, you know, we live in
the same countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar like in the States,
in California or you can smoke anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, but in Arkansas, they will
lock you up for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that punishment and the
policies towards any drugs should be based
[SPEAKER_00]: on scientific data, not just because I use
drugs, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's going to change?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think obviously the EU has to,
or the UN and the EU have to change their
[SPEAKER_02]: mandates towards drugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Germany just has to do what Canada does
and just say, fuck it, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really, how punitive can you be
against us or towards us if it's Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: the economic engine?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure if Germany will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good example for Germany, now you
mentioned Germany, is that they asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Union if they agree, you know,
with the changes on cannabis policy in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, and they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be done.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more, more states or more countries
will join this club, easier will be for
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for Slovenia, are they ever going to,
they're so small, you know, we only have
[SPEAKER_02]: so much arable land here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they, where do you think, where
Slovenia is niche in terms of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: market in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: The niche is knowledge, science,
and boutique products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have big areas like Ukraine or,
you know, other big countries to have
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of hectares of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia is 22,000 square kilometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the size of New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe until last September when you
organized the ICBC in Bled, you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even realize how much knowledge is already
in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how many people are working on
the cannabis research from Hobbs Institute
[SPEAKER_00]: to everywhere, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this event was very good because we
showed the cannabis and all the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: from different angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not just an activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a businessman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, tell us a little bit about your
company, Research Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all started back in 2014 when I
realized that there will be no changes if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started organizing scientific
conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited people, the best researchers
from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized that it's not enough if I
want to do something or we all together
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do something with this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to take a scientific approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I founded Research Nature Institute
with my, unfortunately, late partner from
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovakia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy had prostate cancer and he was
cured of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he died from some other things which
were, we will not talk about this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bought us GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the goals was I wanted to
prove to others in our government that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no influence on driving when you
smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a project with Ministry of
Internal Affairs and police where we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted, because we have some polygons in
Vronsko for safe driving, where we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to prove what is the influence of cannabis
on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they stepped back and, you know,
because they know there is no influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, already back in 2015,
we started to profiling the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products which are on the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People buying from dealers, you know,
or suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then step by step we developed,
you know, a lot of projects going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with my colleague Roman, we somehow
succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was with University of Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roman, you know, Roman Stukel,
he was on the Faculty of Health Sciences
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, listen, we could do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you buy DAD UV detector for
cannabinoids, you know, and maybe we start
[SPEAKER_00]: profiling cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, of course, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you started working with
the University of Ljubljana.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we bought, I bought, our
institute bought DAD detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we got the GCMS, we signed the
agreement of cooperation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I installed the GCM at the machine on
the, in the laboratory of faculty in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until now, we participated on 12 PhDs with
our machine, with our help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are profiling for, for patients,
for growers, for industry, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as any other thing, it's developing
through, through years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to reach out to you,
is there a website you can go to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchnature.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researchnature.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, Slovenia is so small that
hardly anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just for Slovenians or can other
people outside of Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do some profiling for big
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still we are growing, you know,
and you have to start small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Slovenia is small.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great place to bathe a product,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can make it in Slovenia,
I think you can make it, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's great about what you said is
Slovenia does have, it's like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland, a little Holland,
a little Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel when I'm here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people have this connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very high, highly educated people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the Dutch and the Slovenians
that speak the most languages per country,
[SPEAKER_02]: per individual on average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and when I'm here, I'm really blown
away by the, the talent in Slovenia and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the research capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've had meetings with all the,
all the people we've had meetings with all
[SPEAKER_02]: these institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's a high level of work that
they, that they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's only a matter of time
that I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Slovenia's niche is research
and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited to see where, where that
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but I have an important question to
ask you, Bozo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how old were you when you first,
when you first smoked weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: In Murska, Sobota.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Murska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind the school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Behind the school?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get high?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because sometimes you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get high the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, back in the days,
that was 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody bothered us because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all started later when, let's say after
the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was actually one of my questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it started after 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the cannabis scene like in
Yugoslavia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that in the seventies was
obviously Yugoslavia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was illicit drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was illicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of like, kind of like now or like
now, now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, hard to buy,
hard to get, but it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was smoking cannabis,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more hiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more private.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not open like today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody went to jail actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who was using cannabis then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it have a certain demographic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the, the, the, the artists?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote unquote, or was it the, the workers
or was it the students?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was still a hippie movement
back in seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I don't know what your
audience think about former Yugoslavia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but former Yugoslavia was not the Eastern
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go anywhere with our Yugoslavian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a really good
distinction that the audience should know
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a, it's a very, it's a big
misconception that Yugoslavia was part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Eastern block, which meant that it was
part of the Soviet union, which meant that
[SPEAKER_02]: it was more of a Stalinistic communist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Tito communism, which is
bordering on like heavy socialism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think the biggest distinction,
cause I remember growing up, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the seventies and eighties and,
and, and thinking the Soviet union was the
[SPEAKER_02]: most evil place in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solely because you couldn't leave the
country without special permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had people that would defect and
that was always like a big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, but, but, but in Yugoslavia,
you didn't have that restriction,
[SPEAKER_02]: correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you could, you could go anywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Yugoslavian passport, passport,
I could travel to Moscow or to Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_02]: or to the United States, wherever that the
Yugoslavian passport actually could go to
[SPEAKER_02]: more countries than in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually Yugoslavia was a promised land
for Eastern block because Hungarians,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulgarians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they could not go to the West,
but they could go to Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Yugoslavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians,
they visited Yugoslavia, the coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dalmatian coast as a tourist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could go as a tourist,
but then couldn't they, if they wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: escape then from Croatia, take a boat to
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I live just on Hungarian border
and my aunt lived in Hungary and always
[SPEAKER_00]: when their family came over, one member of
family has to stay home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody is behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the reason most people
didn't defect because of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a really good point,
but interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that they had the privilege
to come into Yugoslavia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could go to, they could go to
Dubrovnik or Split or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabis scene, but then you said
in 2000, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then Yugoslavia breaks up, Slovenia
becomes a country, what in 91,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it got bad for 10 years or things
started to decline?
[SPEAKER_00]: First 10 years it was a chaos,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in 2000, we accepted the law
about the illicit drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bureaucrats saw their
opportunity and police, and they started
[SPEAKER_00]: to really push, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so it started to get bad in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in 2000 was, and then after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that because Slovenia was coming into
the EU and wanted to be a good boy or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just because the new law, you know,
just because of the new law, because
[SPEAKER_00]: always when the new law is introduced,
they want to show that they are fulfilling
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, but it doesn't last for long,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they mixed up criminal law with
the minor offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because since 2000, nobody in Slovenia or
Yugoslavia, Slovenia, sorry, should not be
[SPEAKER_00]: jailed for possession of any illicit drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because possession is not a criminal
offense, trafficking is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when you say drugs are,
or cannabis is legal, you kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you said before, that's the qualifier
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that everybody
bureaucrat or every police or every
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecutor, you know, try to push a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, well, so they can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you say try, the prosecutor would
then have to go for, well, their
[SPEAKER_02]: trafficking or something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they can't get them for
possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for trafficking, they have very,
very stupid reasons, like too high
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you are unemployed and you have
plants at home, you will sell them and
[SPEAKER_00]: such bullshit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without any evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we start to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, you know, a friend of mine,
a doctor, a medical doctor, grew for his
[SPEAKER_00]: wife, cannabis, because she has cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And police came, they want to prosecute
him, but it stops on the first level on
[SPEAKER_00]: the court.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a criminal offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the police will still sometimes try to
push where they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the generally the first level,
especially some rookies in police,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they want to prove themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before Slovenia had around 2500
criminal cases on cannabis a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: On two million people, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two and a half percent, or it's
1.25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as much as in the States, but a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know, per capita,
that's almost as much as the States,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe per capita.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not today anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not today anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't catch you with really big,
big, big amount, with some proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: trafficking, you will just get fined or
not even this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel extremely safe here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So was that the time you became an
activist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you proactively started to... And how
long did you go on your hunger strike for?
[SPEAKER_00]: 82 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost like 28 kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost 28 kilos?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be about almost 65 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost one third of my weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember it and you got a lot of...
But then they dropped the charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got on parole for one
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the fight between me and the
judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he expected to be there and say,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fight back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fighting with the prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fighting with the judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I achieved that I got another judge
because I proved this was corrupt and
[SPEAKER_00]: stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you got the judge switched?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was yelling at him as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes balls, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was in an investigation prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could lock me up to 10 years,
what I have to lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can lock you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can keep you there for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they charged me as an organization
and it's 5 to 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insanely scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that means you had to have even
bigger balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't just facing a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are in an investigation
prison, you don't have contact to other
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have telephone call to your lawyer and
your family and they are all listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have telephone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your lawyer comes... Your lawyer,
you communicate through your lawyer who
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to visit you.
Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the best lawyer ever imagined
because he done everything what I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was there just as a... That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me, Mr. Adisic, this we will
not won.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, don't worry, Mr. Hari,
we will win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had 12 criminal charges and I was
actually just one was successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was your probation then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got from that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know you changed Slovenia in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that's really
important for people to know in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think we just got here and now here we
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a lot of people who took
risk, went to prison, actually cared about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not just the economics of
cannabis shouldn't be legal because the
[SPEAKER_02]: economics, it might be legal because of
the economics of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the human rights aspect of it is it's
a civil liberty to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you proved that in Slovenia
and made really big inroads in the culture
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all did, yes, it was a long way with
thorny way, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started to come to Slovenia 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was 20 years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually a funny story because
that's one of the reasons I fell in love
[SPEAKER_02]: with Slovenia, because I came here in 2002
to Iran, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a little tiny piece of hash with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after like three days,
it was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started I started asking on the
streets in Iran.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing when I did get to
Iran, spray painted on the rocks on the
[SPEAKER_02]: promenade around the Punta was Pira Pira
Pira Amsterdam, Pira Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Pira Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then and this is a true story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found someone on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's I say, look, I get some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he said, yeah, come to the
Punta.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Punta bar at seven o'clock in 1900.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, OK, so I went to the Punta bar
and I was expecting to see him just in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cut in the corner or whatever and back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was at the the shrunk, the the the
bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was he was that he was the bark behind
the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, hey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, I just want and
then like a few of the five grams or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then it was toll hours and he was
like, well, it's five thousand toll hours
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would be about 20 euros or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he reached under the counter and
without a bag or anything, just put some I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it was some Albanian weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a CD or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was happy to have something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just looked at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him the five thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just looked at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was the weed all over the and I
just took my shirt and I put it into my
[SPEAKER_02]: shirt, rolled up my shirt and kind of duck
walked back to my hotel, my weed and my
[SPEAKER_02]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just knew that I had found home at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me and you stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had I had lived in Amsterdam for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but I was living in Amsterdam and I
actually thought, wow, this there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something even more free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's because that was Obama.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we say the coast here in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe there was some other kind of a
little bit different spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also remember going to Ljubljana at
that time and going to the Schmautz and
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking weed at the Schmautz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody gave a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I was like, wow,
this is this is this is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt it felt so open even back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: People seem to smoke everywhere in
Ljubljana and it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pass through Ljubljana every five
meters, you smell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even 20 years ago, it was pretty open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just shows how crazy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you were on the coast and in
Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would come to our region,
then it's something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved to Stajarska for a while and it
was it was definitely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, there was the I used
to go to a place called Pekarna to do
[SPEAKER_02]: music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like it was like it felt like
what was Christiana in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they kind of have that open,
that squat, that open, free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Matelkova.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Matelkova.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Matelkova.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I did know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they both existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Matelkova is is the bigger version of
the free state of Ljubljana, where they
[SPEAKER_02]: take the old army barracks and turn it
into a squatters area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the squatters make it what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cops kind of leave them alone or?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tolerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here and then when rookies or in
Ljubljana, because they send them usually
[SPEAKER_00]: from the rural area to Ljubljana,
they may have some problems, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very, very rare that you have any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will tell you, do you think that
police didn't know what is going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pekarna or in Matelkova?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could raid the place every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nothing happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because where is the weed, there is no
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why that's why that's one of the
reasons I've always loved Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just really cool on the weed
scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go outside of Slovenia,
you don't feel safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you come back into Slovenia and
you feel super safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are in Slovenia with this very
open liberal, these very open and liberal
[SPEAKER_02]: attitudes towards cannabis politically or
policy wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, where do you see Slovenia in five
years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have hope that things are going to
change in Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, my hope is for years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you always got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to always have hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you are in Slovenia and you know a
bit about our political system,
[SPEAKER_00]: about our parties and so on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have usually we have very unstable
governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely one government stays all four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before the election, they all
promising we will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will legalize or regulate or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all forget after the elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is now for 20 years like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the better question is,
where do you want Slovenia to be in five
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, regarding human rights,
because use of cannabis is also a human
[SPEAKER_00]: right because every use of cannabis is
therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what has to happen then to make that
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I agree with what you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to put a bit more effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we will raise our voice
a bit in the parliament soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yelling, but raise a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just make the message heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is any common sense among
politicians, it should be done yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least this year before the
elections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after the elections, then you have
to work on new connections, new,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, lobbying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the word, but it is kind of
lobbying because you have to organize
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians, bureaucrats, journalists,
everything to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's organizing, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think with your help and our work,
we will do it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from your lips to God's ears,
Bozo, thank you for being on this podcast,
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the World Meets Cannabis,
the first ICBC podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a real honor to have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bozida Radicic, researchnature.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to go check it out,
check him out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Google him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's our legend in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bozo again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you soon, Marco.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you soon.
