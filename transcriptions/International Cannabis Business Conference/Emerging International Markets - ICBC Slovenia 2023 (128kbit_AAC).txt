[SPEAKER_05]: To discuss emerging international markets,
we have a crack team and the panel will be
[SPEAKER_05]: moderated by the president and CEO of
Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's welcome Steven Verbeek!
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey everybody, as Engawa stated,
my bad, we were actually close friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Steven Verbeek, I'm from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I founded a company called Hello Cannabis
back about eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started in tissue culture and genetics,
merged with a different LP and
[SPEAKER_03]: concurrently I was working as a medical
clinic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We branched off into recreational,
we opened up the very first recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: store in the G20 nation and just for my
own credibility I'll say that there's very
[SPEAKER_03]: few people in the world that can say that
they have sold over 50 million dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: worth of legal cannabis and I'm one of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a claim to not fame but a claim to
a reality that we are actually people that
[SPEAKER_03]: do it and this is why I believe that this
is one of the most important panels here
[SPEAKER_03]: because we are seeing everybody talking
about concepts and ideas on how to bring
[SPEAKER_03]: out legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been a part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of the co-authors and contributors
for the Cannabis Act in Canada and the
[SPEAKER_03]: very first continuing medical education
course where there were six co-authors for
[SPEAKER_03]: it, myself being one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So doctors can literally earn credits in
Canada for medical cannabis and I'm one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the contributing authors authors for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So myself and every single person on this
panel, I know them all very personally as
[SPEAKER_03]: well for many years, we are people that
are actually doing it and we have seen
[SPEAKER_03]: this from concept where we're going back
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm part of the legacy market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have seen this from black market,
legacy market, all the way to a gray
[SPEAKER_03]: market, to a legal market and battled
everything including the governments,
[SPEAKER_03]: including the doctors and all of the
problems and gaps that I have been hearing
[SPEAKER_03]: all across the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've now spoken in I believe 16 different
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are all identical and I'm telling you
that every single person in this panel is
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody that has lived through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is still doing it right now to this
day and our resources that can help.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are here to be able to help countries
that are legalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been through this already and we
are sources of people, we are resources
[SPEAKER_03]: that are actually doing it and this is
something that unfortunately is not
[SPEAKER_03]: happening in many areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is still just talk, it is still just
conversations and you even saw the largest
[SPEAKER_03]: market which is Germany is still talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still figuring it out,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been speaking in Berlin for seven
years now where it was still raw,
[SPEAKER_03]: raw, raw, legal, legal, legal,
legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven years later, we're still figuring it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are people that have figured it out
in countries that have figured it out and
[SPEAKER_03]: we've battled and we are still battling a
wild industry to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is my story and I urge you to
listen to these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They each have a different specialty and
they're close friends and colleagues that
[SPEAKER_03]: I collaborate with around the world and we
are truly here to help people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get more joy out of being able to
contribute and collaborate with different
[SPEAKER_03]: countries and of course, self-fulfilling
prophecy here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have careers and we like getting
paid but we bring value.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not just taking shareholders money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are revenue generating companies and
our goal is to be able to help you
[SPEAKER_03]: generate revenue and not just be fluff and
talk and burning money every single day
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what the vast majority of this
entire industry is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this panel is different, I assure you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without further ado, this is a my very
close friend, Dr. This is JC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please come.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next we have Carm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carm is a wonderful lady who is part of
New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the only legal producer in New
Zealand and ready and able to export.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we in Canada, but we will share.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this gentleman I've known for many
years, this is Kai.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a legal expert in cannabis
practicing in Germany and represents many
[SPEAKER_03]: different cannabis companies specifically
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another close friend of mine,
Nima, we met in Zurich many years ago and
[SPEAKER_03]: in fact, actually one of his business
partners is from my hometown in Canada as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this gentleman is part of the pilot
project in Switzerland where he is one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the only people that is able to produce
and sell cannabis and cannabis extracts to
[SPEAKER_03]: the pilot project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we are people doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are active.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are revenue generating.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are real companies, real people,
operating real things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I've said the word real
enough, but I want to reinforce that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the focus of this panel is,
well, tell you what.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spoke very broadly about each of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to elaborate further about
what you do individually and then we will
[SPEAKER_03]: have a roundtable discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do believe that in open forums,
because we are resources, please ask us
[SPEAKER_03]: questions and get our contacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please tell us more about yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm John.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Malta and in Malta I'm a licensed
physician and prescriber and I support
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors with two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Educating doctors to become prescribers
and better prescriber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Supporting them with tech, medical tech,
data tech, which is supporting doctors in
[SPEAKER_04]: all areas of medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But especially cannabis medicine and
innovative fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Malta has had medical cannabis now for
five years and since then it's been a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of battles, a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things have worked, some things
haven't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best part about being here and
speaking to you is to see the enthusiasm
[SPEAKER_04]: and to help that enthusiasm and make it to
the other side with success and hopefully
[SPEAKER_04]: avoiding some of the pitfalls and some of
the bullets.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we've had to take in our own
respective countries and lessons we've
[SPEAKER_03]: learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lots of bullets in us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an easy industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can promise that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you find anybody that has been in
this industry for longer than five years,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a lifetime, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We say dog years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so cute when people say like,
oh, I've been in the cannabis industry for
[SPEAKER_03]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like how long?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like two, three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, this industry is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how long have you?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I had hair before, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kia ora everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Carmen Doran and I think I get
the prize for coming from the furtherest
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helios is a medicines company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are New Zealand's largest producer of
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Stephen said, we're the only New
Zealand grown, New Zealand made producer
[SPEAKER_00]: who is in market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first to achieve our GMP
license back in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in market for two years in New
Zealand catering for patients in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of our real goals at Helios
was to look after our own patients first.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you heard, we're ramping up for export
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a vertically integrated company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our own highly controlled
indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own extraction facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make our own finished products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own GMP analytical testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our own R&D space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a number of collaborations
across New Zealand with research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development partnerships into
universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that I can
probably share is a different perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: here on how medical can be done and done
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I will definitely say,
but one thing that we do see in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand, which is a bit different to what
I'm seeing in Europe is really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: government support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have support and funding for our R&D
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have support and funding for our export
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason that I'm here today to
be able to tell you all about what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also as a small country,
not quite as small as Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just 5 million people, we're able to
really interact and talk with our ministry
[SPEAKER_00]: of health, with our politicians and with
our government departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that Slovenia could really
learn and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as well with being able
to have those conversations just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones we're having here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kai Friedrich Niemann.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lawyer from Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lawyer since 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Germany legalized medical cannabis
in 2017, also the first CBD projects came
[SPEAKER_01]: up and no one really knew how to regulate
them or how to treat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started a deep dive into these
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this blog was read by Prohibition
Partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition Partners was read by M.
[SPEAKER_01]: James Daly and was invited to the US,
to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 2019, I'm only representing and
consulting medical cannabis import
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, CBD companies, hemp companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we are preparing for
recreational reform here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also the legal advisor of the
European Industrial Hemp Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: the IHA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are preparing four different
applications for noble food, for noble
[SPEAKER_01]: food products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm advisory board member of the
International Cannabis Bar Association and
[SPEAKER_01]: a board member of Law Enforcement Against
Prohibition Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it up for Kai.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want legal representation and any
connectors in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: I urge you to find a good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not be sitting here today if I
didn't have representation from a good
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, actually, Eric Foster was a
partner at Dentons in Canada and was one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the people that actually helped train
Peter, who is now head of the European
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis area here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it was not for me meeting Eric
Foster of Dentons and somehow,
[SPEAKER_03]: someway impressing him, which is baffling
still because he's kind of a big deal,
[SPEAKER_03]: just like Kai, they make introductions and
they pick their back.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of battles and there's a lot
of cannabis client center out there all
[SPEAKER_03]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a good lawyer is somebody that I urge
you to cozy up with and he's handsome too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my sales pitch for you,
pal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nima, it's all you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I just want to say thank you
for the warm welcome that I had here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenia, really nice country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Switzerland over here,
so I feel like home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a friend of the plant for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in this business for seven
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a law background, but not as many
as he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started the first company with CBD with my
brother, Swiss Hemp Care.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a family owned business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with 40,000 Swiss francs,
build it up, made millions of revenue,
[SPEAKER_02]: made a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then went to medicinal cannabis,
which is Charlie's lab, my other company,
[SPEAKER_02]: a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we lost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we applied for the Swiss pilot
trials, which started this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we officially are allowed to sell THC
from 1st to January 24th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said, the resumes on this table
are pretty significant, and I'd like to
[SPEAKER_03]: reiterate as well that Slovenia is like a
second home to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first love in university was actually
Slovenian, and I lived here for a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: months, and I'm for hire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to be a part of this country
officially.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my sales pitch for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me know if I can help in cannabis
in Slovenia, and I will come running very
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a Disney movie right now,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about some themes that I've
noticed that were consistent here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I assure you they're consistent across
the entire world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them is just focusing on the
medical side.
[SPEAKER_03]: We find that there is a big roadblock with
access to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first step is, of course,
physician awareness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Physicians are a unique breed,
and what I've noticed is that physicians
[SPEAKER_03]: are a unique breed across the entire world
with very similar similarities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll work on my vocabulary, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without physician education, it's lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, Slovenia has had medical
cannabis illegal for what, six years?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many prescriptions are active here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to jump out the window hearing
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that there's no
prescriptions is because there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: physicians prescribing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is because there's lack of
education, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not Googling how it worked in
Canada in reading when they have spent
[SPEAKER_03]: their, how many years getting a license
that could be in jeopardy by prescribing a
[SPEAKER_03]: narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first step is de-stigmatizing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I promise I could write a calculus
exam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my job is to de-stigmatize cannabis
around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an interesting personal story,
but I'm a moderator and I won't take the
[SPEAKER_03]: sunshine here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the physicians need to be educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're a unique breed in order to
educate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be face-to-face or be another
physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, I find it is very difficult to be
able to break through to physicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am saying all of these things to lead
into a doctor that's sitting beside me
[SPEAKER_03]: that specializes in tech and specializes
in educating doctors and allowing them to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to prescribe more effectively,
allowing them to be able to titrate,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to find out what cannabinoid
profiles work, what levels of THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: what levels of different elements of the
plant, what levels of either combustion or
[SPEAKER_03]: non-combustion, what delivery mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has developed tech that is very similar
to the tech that we developed in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he is taking it to another level to
make the prescribing process easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that this is the forefront
to be able to help Slovenia here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are no prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even legal for six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gentleman is somebody that can
provide the tools to be able to help
[SPEAKER_03]: educate physicians so that they can
prescribe better, more effectively,
[SPEAKER_03]: more confidently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming from a physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: So reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Stephen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in Malta, the experience of having
six years now of medical cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_04]: same metric is a problem, the number of
physicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that metric affects the accessibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if there are not many physicians,
it's difficult to get access.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you think about accessibility and
physician education, you get down to a
[SPEAKER_04]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is the barrier and the
solution is a bridge to that barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first you need to look at the
difference between legalization and
[SPEAKER_04]: normalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2018, when Malta legalized medical
cannabis, there was a legal channel for
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors to write a prescription.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like any other prescriptions,
they have a legal access.
[SPEAKER_04]: But any prescription made by a doctor
anywhere carries a weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That weight is the warrant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we allow doctors to prescribe
substances for people to use in our
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstream societies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I educate doctors and I teach
prescribers about how to go about adding
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis to their arsenal, to the
therapeutic arsenal, ultimately there are
[SPEAKER_04]: two things which arise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about the scientific and the
educational part, let's say, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: liability.
[SPEAKER_04]: The liability of a doctor writing a
medication, which can go really either
[SPEAKER_04]: way, just like any other therapy,
it's a risk benefit analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that risk benefit is something that
every doctor has in his mind before he
[SPEAKER_04]: makes the decision, I will prescribe this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what's really been lacking in
many countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalization is only a half measure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next measure is to get that into
mainstream medical prescribing,
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstream medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a lot of scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier on today we had some brilliant
panelists and some brilliant speakers
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about the science of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But medicine is an applied science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone needs to get those trials,
those studies, and apply them into what we
[SPEAKER_04]: call in medicine clinical practice
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guidelines that the medical boards and the
medical faculty across the world can agree
[SPEAKER_04]: that this is a standard of care in
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_04]: That leads me to the next point,
liability.
[SPEAKER_04]: In malpractice, how do we decide whether a
doctor was in the right or in the wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something we call a standard of care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in any malpractice suite you have a
panel, a peer, a panel of peers,
[SPEAKER_04]: expert peers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we had to look at the pediatrician
and explore a case, and you have to decide
[SPEAKER_04]: whether this pediatrician acted well or
badly with any medicine, you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a group of expert peers deciding
whether that use of the medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: that prescription, was up to the best
standard of care possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this expert peer view, these groups
are the doctors associations that we know
[SPEAKER_04]: of, the GPs, the pediatricians,
the geriatricians.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, when we talk about
cannabis, these people have been left out
[SPEAKER_04]: by the industry in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that is one of the biggest
pain points that I would like to
[SPEAKER_04]: communicate here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We often look at the mavericks in this
industry, the pioneering cannabis doctors
[SPEAKER_04]: who are doing it all, they're doing
amazing work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're that doctor in that part of
the country, that one guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not enough to support an
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will never be enough to support a
medical industry which needs mainstream
[SPEAKER_04]: support.
[SPEAKER_04]: And doctors need mainstream support.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to have a bridge connecting
producers, connecting policymakers,
[SPEAKER_04]: legislators, to the doctors and to the
patients, to the waiting rooms of
[SPEAKER_04]: clinicians who, they're not cannabis
doctors and they never will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have been approached.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been approached by an industry
of cannabis medicine, innovative medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: innovative natural medicine, which more
and more patients now are being very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very passionate about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is definitely an important point
I'd like to communicate off the bat about
[SPEAKER_04]: how to go about starting physician
education and building a framework for
[SPEAKER_04]: successful medical cannabis industry in
any country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll see if I can circle back so we
can speak a little bit more about the
[SPEAKER_03]: technology that he's using.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fantastic platform and it drives a
lot of the data from our clinics as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, Hello Cannabis has 7,000
patients that we have all individually
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribed and they have purchased
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is real.
[SPEAKER_03]: We literally save lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: My company, Hello Cannabis, is a suffix
for goodbye opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an opioid survivor from a tragic
injury in a wheelchair six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not taken a painkiller or a pill
for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I go to a pain clinic, they're
giving me heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still do it every single year.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will prescribe me heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be a junkie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a heroin addict by hour four,
taking enough medication to shoot up
[SPEAKER_03]: intravenously.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taking it in a pill, but I was
taking enough in a pill to shoot up three
[SPEAKER_03]: times every four hours, 24 hours a day,
seven days a week for three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get goosebumps still talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I very rarely speak about it publicly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a fucking heroin addict,
flat out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wasn't using a needle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit cold turkey after two months and I
have flatlined twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once was because of withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this data works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bridging this gap to these physicians
is critically important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can bridge into this because this
is exactly what Carmen and I were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about out front, which I found very
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now there are no physicians
prescribing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my job originally, my business partner
is a doctor and I own like, as an
[SPEAKER_03]: entrepreneur, long story short,
I was connected with a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: surgeons and I managed money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I knew rich people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them are doctors and surgeons and
they saw my recovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was able to bridge that gap of trust
where they said like, yo, this guy's a
[SPEAKER_03]: derivatives trader.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's on the cover of an investment
magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is not a stoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And little did they know that I was on
cannabis managing their money every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was damn good at my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I already had that trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had another physician to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started this medical clinic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I urge anybody that is opening up a
cannabis company here, you are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: screwed if you do not have a clinic that
you were working with or starting on your
[SPEAKER_03]: own.
[SPEAKER_03]: That focuses on destigmatizing cannabis
and educating physicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get all of the different groups and
pound it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was knocking on doors every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 78 physicians that refer patients
to Hello Cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have shook hands with literally every
one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get in front of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are going to become a
cultivator, you need distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a businessman.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the field of dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you build it, they will come.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow it, it will sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada has sold 17% of everything we've
grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name any industry that can survive if you
sell 17% of all of your production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if all of the coffee growers only
sold 17% of the beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, the distribution is through
medical channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to get that medical channel open,
you need people like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is free advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are going to be screwed if you do not
have doctors that are prescribing because
[SPEAKER_03]: you won't have patients, which means you
won't have revenue, which the only way
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to survive is burning
shareholders' money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And getting more money to burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that CARM is doing over
in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very special that they have a
government that supports this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she can speak with respect to how the
medical program is working there and how
[SPEAKER_03]: they are able to prescribe and the pain
points that they've faced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New Zealand, we have a medicinal
cannabis scheme that's been in place since
[SPEAKER_00]: September 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came into place on the 30th of
September and Helios launched our first
[SPEAKER_00]: product on the 4th of October,
just four days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I wanted to share
is that our medicinal cannabis scheme
[SPEAKER_00]: covers CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it covers all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any doctor in New Zealand can
prescribe for any condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that by having CBD under that
prescribing law, I look at that in two
[SPEAKER_00]: ways compared to what I see here in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, I think it's overkill that
you need a doctor to prescribe CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other cases, the rules are very
clear, unlike here in Europe where CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: a medicine and it is prescribed by
doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has actually been a route where
doctors have been able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis a little bit better by starting
with prescribing CBD before moving on to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe maybe a balanced product,
before moving on to thinking about THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an easy route in for some of
our GPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've had to really focus on
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Helios, even before the scheme came
into place, we held medical conferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: MedCan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had experts from around the world come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Professor Mike Barnes from the UK,
some of you may have heard of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had him come to New Zealand and do some
education programmes for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to two doctors conferences every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in October, we're gonna have a couple
of events where doctors are coming along
[SPEAKER_00]: to Helios to see what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I bring that up is that that is
probably the biggest game changer we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen around breaking down stigma is
actually having doctors and politicians
[SPEAKER_00]: come to our site and see how we make
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the most skeptical, let's be polite,
skeptical politicians when they've come to
[SPEAKER_00]: Helios and they've come into our facility
and we've dressed up all in our white
[SPEAKER_00]: gowns and our hair nets and our shoe
covers and we've gone into the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facility have changed their minds about
cannabis and about what that cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we go into this facility, one of our
politicians who was dead against cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: said to me, but Carmen, it's so clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yes, we're making medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, but yes, it's so clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that in her mind,
the view of cannabis as a medicine was
[SPEAKER_00]: very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she thought we were growing in a
shed with foil on the windows and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: super dodgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to come and see the
precision to look along the plants and see
[SPEAKER_00]: that every single one is the same height
to go into the extraction facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: have our extraction manager explain in
detail how we pull out the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant and how we do that the same
way every single time has been a really
[SPEAKER_00]: big way that we've been able to break down
some of the stigma for politicians or for
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors and really understand that what we
are making as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the insights I wanted to
share with this audience today.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I love about that story is in New
Zealand, they were actually able to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the doctors to come to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so easy in Canada, but it's very
true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stigma right there, they think about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that they've seen is on
television when they're watching cops and
[SPEAKER_03]: they see somebody breaking, kicking open a
door and in the basement or in an attic
[SPEAKER_03]: with mold and foil and black tape covering
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think that that's how medicine is
made.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's baffling when people walk into a real
cultural cultivation facility for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time, particularly doctors,
and precisely that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, this is very clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can eat off the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make medicine, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very, very surprising how their
mind and the stigma, even after
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization in Canada, is still there
years later until they actually see it
[SPEAKER_03]: with their first hand or until they
actually hear a real success story from
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody that's eloquent, not just like,
I'm in a lot of pain and I just smoke weed
[SPEAKER_03]: and I feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to give any credibility
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're hearing it from another
physician or they're seeing it from first
[SPEAKER_03]: hand, it starts swaying and it's still in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tours all the time and that shock
and awe is still there with physicians
[SPEAKER_03]: being like, it's harmless.
[SPEAKER_03]: How the hell do you walk into a
cultivation room and think this kills
[SPEAKER_03]: people?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's literally zero deaths because of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've died twice because of heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is real truth here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to find a much easier bridge to a
legal perspective in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alluding me right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been pretty smooth at the
transitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I really think I should really talk
about here is in Germany right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: right now it's only medically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And recreation, as you heard Peter
speaking earlier, it's still very much up
[SPEAKER_03]: in air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been speaking in Berlin for six,
seven years now where people thought it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like six months away from stores
opening and people running in and buying
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and smoking on the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sylvania's, I highly recommend going
through the medical platform first and we
[SPEAKER_03]: can help avoid the pitfalls of
transitioning from medical to recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's a need for both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like Kai to be able to explain
what he saw in the medical market in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany and hopefully he can be able to
add some color and context on how this can
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit Sylvania and the Balkans in
general and Europe in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I do believe that the medical
market in Germany is set up not to fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's set up to succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just still very new and the doors
have not, not enough doors have been
[SPEAKER_03]: knocked on yet so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the German medical market is
actually better than Canada's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not sophisticated or I should
not use that word with Germans,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fleshed out and efficient enough
yet just because it's still in more or
[SPEAKER_03]: less trial stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada's been operating for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we had the rules like Germany,
I think we would be able to help a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more people and be able to grow and sell
this product a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The health and revenue is actually a
synergetic thing and that's coming from a
[SPEAKER_03]: businessman that's an opioid survivor that
puts health first and the money was a
[SPEAKER_03]: byproduct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I was not kidding when I
say my company has sold over 50 million
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars worth of cannabis and the whole
ethos is health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye opioids, hello cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you see in the medical market
in Germany and how can, how can they more
[SPEAKER_03]: or less learn from what Germany has done
because it's still slow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started 2014 with 1,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had an exception and could obtain
cannabis from the pharmacies and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there was this one case where this patient
grew his own cannabis on his balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a criminal offense and he fought
this thing and in the end he, at the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest administrative court, he was
admitted to grow his cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_01]: balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: The German government obviously didn't
like it that all patients can grow their
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis on their balcony so they set up a
whole new law, the Cannabis as Medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: Act that came into force in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started with 1,000 patients and now
we have, we don't count the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only count the prescriptions which are
reimbursed from the public health
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance, insurances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but probably we have 250,000 patients
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market volume is, we don't have exact
figures on that as well because we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of self-paying patients which don't
reimburse, which don't apply for
[SPEAKER_01]: reimbursement at the health insurances.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market size is probably between 300
and 400 million, somewhere between that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a tiny market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very big market, but still very
fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conditions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We imported 25 tons of dried flowers last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 tons were delivered to pharmacies and
you don't see any real growth increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: dried flowers for public health insurers
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the future of the market definitely is
the self-payer market where people obtain
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis from our prescriptions and don't
even think about reimbursement or to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the future of the market for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe one or the only positive aspect
about the new draft which the Federal
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Ministry represented two weeks ago
or three weeks ago is that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: removed from the narcotic product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a narcotic anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a zooegenerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a commodity zooegenerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say even stricter, regulated and
controlled than before, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that helps for doctors as well for
education purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have the stigma of a
narcotic anymore, but somewhere between an
[SPEAKER_01]: own commodity and a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to figure that out exactly if
science progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you said, if you prescribe a
narcotic, the physician is obliged to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: risk benefit analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is the risk that the patient gets
addicted and that the situation gets even
[SPEAKER_01]: worse?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these analysis, the physicians don't
have to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can prescribe it and please pay
attention on that if you set up the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical regime any indication is possible
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shouldn't be restricted like in
Portugal to seven indications or like in
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK where you can prescribe cannabis
only for very few conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has potential to help anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the future definitely is in the
self-prayer market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll highlight a few key points in the
German market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reimbursement program is something
that is astonishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a very strong reimbursement
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada, we have what's called OHIP.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like insurance coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is not only not included in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the best part.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have what's called an excise stamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a syntax.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things like cigarettes, they have a
special wrapper with a special stamp where
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to pay an extra big tax because
it's bad for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our cannabis medicine has an excise stamp
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is still even we're by far the most
fleshed out and sophisticated of the G20
[SPEAKER_03]: nations for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have been lobbying and I've been
sitting on boards and sitting on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadian Cannabis Council.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a member of the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce, like one of the lead cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: advisors there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody has a story of who
qualifies for medical cannabis and its
[SPEAKER_03]: real medical efficacy, it's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just with my own company, we have
7,000 patients, never mind the half
[SPEAKER_03]: million others that are using this
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get taxed as a syntax on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in Germany, they are offering
reimbursement for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I urge policymakers here in Slovenia
to understand that this is a real
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's irrefutable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason that it's still like that
in Canada is because of bureaucracy and
[SPEAKER_03]: the genies out of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're very much enjoying the
monetary tax benefits out of that excise
[SPEAKER_03]: stamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, I watch Netflix miniseries of
corruption and I'd laugh saying that was
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking Tuesday morning for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really, really dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're very young and the knowledge and
experience that we've had weighs like a
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very, very heavy, heavy weight on
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I got to commend Germany for being
able to follow this reimbursement program
[SPEAKER_03]: for real medicine that really works.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no denying this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not anecdotal anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not me standing up seven years ago
saying, I am not mentally disabled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a competent person that is on cannabis
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am a sophisticated professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how it started.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is now no longer anecdotal or me
talking on a podium.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is irrefutable medical data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does require reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am unfamiliar with the ins and outs of
the medical program here in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there reimbursement?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that with cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's educate the physicians so we can
help people and get them off of much worse
[SPEAKER_03]: narcotics and have them reimbursed for
medicine that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please let us help because the combination
of all of these experts here will ideally
[SPEAKER_03]: put together, in my opinion, a perfect
system methodically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing it's a lot harder, but you get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of somebody that's doing it,
it's transition of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nima is one of the gentlemen that is doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've met around the world at
different conferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, this man has a brain
that's not from planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's also humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's a sharp one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he specializes in extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: He specializes in distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly, he's part of a major pilot
program in a very sophisticated country,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nima, can you please explain how the
medical program was originally working,
[SPEAKER_03]: and now you're part of the recreational
pilot program?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the medical cannabis in Switzerland has
been legal for many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since last year, it's become much
easier for doctors to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, it was only for, if I recall... I
didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_02]: For indications, basically, if you're just
before dying, you can take cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that changed, which is also good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, in Switzerland, there's a lack
of education for doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to a doctor, my doctor,
wanting him to prescribe me medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted to send me to a
psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where will I get my cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a theme here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to come full circle, this is the
biggest theme.
It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you said sophisticated country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pilot trials are recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe to explain a bit about the trials,
we have 26 cantons in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can have a pilot project in one
canton.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have up to 5,000 participants in
that pilot project.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be over 18, and you have to
smoke cannabis or consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't consume cannabis,
you cannot take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big part in the trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: The products range from hash, oil,
vapes, flowers for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles will come as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maximum of 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there... I don't know where that
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the data we collect above 20%,
we won't collect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only up to 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want also ratios like 2010 with CBD,
1-1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the varieties that are grown,
and it was actually quite challenging to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a hash with 20%, but it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret, but it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get these pilot projects, it's a long
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of energy, a little bit of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a research team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is from the ETH, from Zurich,
and you need a topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you researching?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the differences of, for example,
differences of consumption cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_02]: city and in the... Not in the city,
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that costs money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, then you have to... If you are
producing with plants, you have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: certification, which is normally GACP.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely need a track and trace
system in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very important for the government,
and that's more or less for the production
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then extracted is... Extracted,
there's no law how you need to extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can do it as you wish, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to have that... If you say
you will extract 100 kilos at 18% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can calculate how much distillate
you have, and you need to apply that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that in your application, how many
plants, how much you extract, how much
[SPEAKER_02]: distillate you have, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then for the products which we specialize
in, in Charlie's lab, are vapes and oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the oils do not need any novel food or
any approval, so THC is okay in oils,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not in CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, question mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not complaining, just showing it makes
no sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a GMP in the lab,
but you need traceability.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took us two years to get this pilot
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think every other country will legalize
before Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just very, very slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we will get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legalization process is already
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are just many entities that have to
give their opinion, police, Ministry of
[SPEAKER_02]: Health, some consumer protecting
associations, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure we will get there one day and
just stay positive and promote this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the right way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my advice to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay positive and lobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lobbying does work to some degree,
but it's not a fun process either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really grateful again to be in this
lovely country.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are open for work here, me
particularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll reiterate that again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to post your resume?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the panel one more
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have time for one question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone have one?
[SPEAKER_06]: California breeder and plant tissue
culture scientist here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been in the trenches for six
years, so you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really need to recognize the black
market's presence worldwide when we're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys remark or comment on some of
the regulatory for medical needing to be
[SPEAKER_06]: or like the bureaucracy needing to be
smooth enough that if someone has access
[SPEAKER_06]: to their plug, their legal, and then the
legal, why they're going to go to the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical, and what advantage does the
medical bring?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it need to be cheaper, better?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your comments on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming from a tissue culture and
basically seed junkie as well that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: traveling around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So respect on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Canada is very similar to California
with the dichotomy between the illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: market and the legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to jump in and finish that,
but please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at the situation in Europe
and the bureaucracy and as the legal
[SPEAKER_04]: experts have told us, it's a lot about the
conventions and a lot about, in
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland we're seeing pilot projects,
so scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in business we say, show me the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: In science we say, show me the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now does it work?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've already discussed the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of studies have been looking into
how recreational cannabis or cannabis has
[SPEAKER_04]: caused harm, but we haven't really had
funding in showing why in a context where
[SPEAKER_04]: a patient can choose to keep getting the
illicit market, why should they choose to
[SPEAKER_04]: go to the medical market, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it needs to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to show data that it works,
and that data is showing patients getting
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion is this is where tech comes in,
and this is where we need to have med tech
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to show that our patients are
getting better.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why advocacy coming from the
medical aspect is so strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to believe me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speak to this patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll tell you his life story.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll tell you about his child who went to
a pediatric doctor and used cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll tell you about his mother who used
cannabis medicine with her geriatrician.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we have that data, we'll be able
to show and give motivation for why people
[SPEAKER_04]: should choose medical over illicit,
because we need, like you very well said,
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to remember that we're not in a
vacuum here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The illicit market is still with us,
and it still offers an option,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we need to be better than that and
show for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what he's reiterating is that the
medical efficacy is real, and as people
[SPEAKER_03]: become more educated, the stigma of going
to an illicit market or not to speak from
[SPEAKER_03]: a business standpoint, because I know both
sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've straddled them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I'm a Dutch guy from
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like BC Bud, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was like we basically supplied all
of North America with cannabis until
[SPEAKER_03]: California kind of opened up, and then
they became the American supplier.
[SPEAKER_03]: What will get people going to medical
instead of the illicit market is a system
[SPEAKER_03]: like in Germany where there's
reimbursement, free weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good incentive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other in Canada, we at least have,
we have tax write-offs for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have grants for medical devices,
things like any non-combustion medical
[SPEAKER_03]: device.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can actually now replicate the
distribution, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're launching an online pharmacy for my
7,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same day delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like amazon.com, except
everything is weed, and it's shopping
[SPEAKER_03]: online.
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with your credit card, and boom,
the same day it's coming there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like find a plug that's going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will crush them, and that's the whole
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be able to compete on price,
compete on quality, and the fastest way to
[SPEAKER_03]: compete on price in the medical market is
to have the government reimburse them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have that privilege in Canada,
so we have to beat them on ease of access,
[SPEAKER_03]: quality, and price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I jump in here as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we discussed as a
panel before we came up is that an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use and a medical market can exist really
well together, and that from cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine perspective, we are giving
cannabis as a medicine to someone who is
[SPEAKER_00]: sick, whether mentally or physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, those people are
immunocompromised, and so the consistency,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to deliver something that is
free of pesticides, free of heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the same strain every time,
that has the same profile every time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also that has that wraparound medical
support, I think is really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price is always going to come into it,
but for me, when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as a medicine, it's all of those
things that are really, really important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and someone who maybe is using cannabis
medicinally, but not as part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one other thing to share there is
that in New Zealand, we're able to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: strains from the illicit market into the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a route to be able to do that
through our medicinal cannabis scheme and
[SPEAKER_00]: a declaration process, where there are no
questions asked around where the strain
[SPEAKER_00]: came from, and there's some really
interesting strains coming from the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market, where people as green fairies have
been really focused on medical outcomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then now we're able to bring those
into a medical setting, also with
[SPEAKER_00]: wraparound healthcare support from their
doctor, from their pharmacy, for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who really needs that help.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the whole panel
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we are out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it was very interesting,
but I'm sure everyone can continue their
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations in the salon and the hallway
and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been the International Cannabis
Business Conference Slovenia Science and
[SPEAKER_05]: Technology Forum.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to thank the good people of Bled
and the good people of Slovenia for coming
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd also like to thank all our panelists,
all the translators, all the audio visual
[SPEAKER_05]: people, everyone here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hotel weekly balance is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget, I cannot stress this enough,
the shuttle leaves at 8.45.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first shuttle leaves at 8.45.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wear your pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna go up to the castle and party
with Magnifico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you haven't had a chance,
please make a donation to help the flood
[SPEAKER_05]: victims in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to the Lions Club booth in the
Exhibitor Hallway, and we will see you in
[SPEAKER_05]: Barcelona and Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful evening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
