[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so yeah, my name is Beau
Whitney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Chief Revenue Officer at Mantis
Growth Investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what Mantis does is we buy
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to retain the management in the
company, optimize them, take profits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then invest those into other
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a multi-state operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently operating in Nevada with
cultivation and retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I wanted to talk about the
cannabis industry first globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to start globally and then
talk about Europe and then throw in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of hemp and then talk about the
impact of US regulatory changes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: global market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reform and the global basis is
accelerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 60 countries have legalized cannabis
in some form, either for industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, adult use, medical, CBD,
and by our calculations there's roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 million consumers generating about 250
billion dollars per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excluding hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And governments are driving this reform
because they see the benefits of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: on their economy, either from a taxation
perspective, a development perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: employment perspective, and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But current policies in the US right now,
I think, are actually hurting the US
[SPEAKER_00]: global competitiveness relative to the
global market, and it's opening the door
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll go into that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're estimating the total
market between 230 billion dollars and 250
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: US currently holds the top spot,
but the EU represents the second largest
[SPEAKER_00]: market on the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is from a revenue perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are currently 24 EU countries that
have some form of legal access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there were some questions,
I inserted this at lunch, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about the total legal market for
cannabis in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forecasting about 25 billion this
year growing to about 45 billion by 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still good opportunity for
growth, assuming that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I look at this graph,
I see the green as the legal market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the difference between that green and
the top of that orange there, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's still a great deal of
opportunity within the US market as there
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the European market, the African
market, the Asian markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Mantis collaborates with my firm,
Whitney Economics, and so we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: data sharing and we use data in our
decision making process for investments,
[SPEAKER_00]: market entry strategies and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a forecast for every country
in the world from a total addressable
[SPEAKER_00]: market perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're forecasting actually,
and this seems counter narrative,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually forecasting an eventual
decline in the total addressable market in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because that as the market opens
in the US, there's gonna be an influx of
[SPEAKER_00]: low cost cannabis products which will
drive down the price and there'll be less
[SPEAKER_00]: spending, even though there may be more
consumers, there'll be less spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually thinking that North
America is near its peak in terms of total
[SPEAKER_00]: addressable market value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the EU side, just five countries
represents about 62, 63% of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: market value in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about $63 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy, France, Germany, UK and Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you think about this, look at
Germany for example, $8.4 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 80,000 medical consumers,
arguably a couple of hundreds or a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of hundred million in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference between that couple of
hundred million and 8.4 billion once again
[SPEAKER_00]: is opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think governments like to see large
numbers, they like the taxation,
[SPEAKER_00]: they like the employment, they like all
that which is represented in that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to realize where the
opportunities lie and then position
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself in order to enter into those
markets at such a time that you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of that growth situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a medical supplier for example,
especially in the EU, could pave your way
[SPEAKER_00]: towards accelerated growth once more
reform occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or establishing a brand say in CBD or
hemp, positioning yourself in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: and then taking advantage of growth that
way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing here is that access
defines opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a great deal of control over
the market, you're not gonna have as much
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you open things up for adult use
and the like, then you can accelerate and
[SPEAKER_00]: capture that market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So access equals opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also look at markets not from a
dollar perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in earlier speeches the speaker
mentioned that there's a human element to
[SPEAKER_00]: this and so let's not forget about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's surprising to note that Europe is
ranked fourth when it comes to the total
[SPEAKER_00]: number of cannabis consumers globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Asia and Africa actually represent the
top two markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way that I view this as well is
if you can look at these markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: see where there's a lot of consumers even
though it may not be a tremendous amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can position yourself and capture that
and hold your first mover position for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Western Europe, there's really no
surprise here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy, France, Germany, Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of consumers there from this
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of consumers in
Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a dynamic here where the
periphery countries are the suppliers and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Western European countries are the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this center periphery
dynamic that's in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so seeing this and understanding it is
going to play a role in how the market is
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, like I said, there's a lot of
economic benefits associated with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to medical and full
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID was interesting in the sense that it
actually hurt people's access through the
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of ability for regulators to get to
inspections and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also accelerated the conversation
saying, hey, there's maybe a constraint
[SPEAKER_00]: like they occurred in Italy or France and
we need to drive greater access or greater
[SPEAKER_00]: supply in the market because there's less
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brexit was kind of interesting timing
as well because that kind of messed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and the trajectory of the UK
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it stifled the imports that was
driving the supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, it stalled out the growth
in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of these markets is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And success is defined by the ease of your
regulatory activities and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some obstacles, obviously,
there with barriers to entry and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though there are these
opportunities, there's still a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: headwinds like regulatory murkiness,
high barriers to entry and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if these five or six countries
that I have listed here, if they all
[SPEAKER_00]: converge about the same time, it'll drive
opportunities not only within Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe but Eastern, Southern, Northern
Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than takeaways, I think these
are more observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the suppliers that I've talked to
in Asia and India and Africa, South
[SPEAKER_00]: America and the like, they're all focusing
in on the European market and Germany in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they all actually are able to
supply into this market, there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: so much supply that it's gonna drive down
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna create an oversupply situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though European market represents
great opportunity, there is a risk that
[SPEAKER_00]: operators need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that's interesting about
Europe is that they're actually setting
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been a lot of discussion
about the problems associated with EUGMP
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think those standards will
proliferate across the globe and will
[SPEAKER_00]: drive standards in the US as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gotta take the good with the bad,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most of the issues,
if you're a supplier trying to feed into
[SPEAKER_00]: the European Union, a lot of the issues
occur on the inbound side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get product out of a country,
but it's really difficult to get it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: UK is a prime example, but Switzerland and
other countries within the EU are facing
[SPEAKER_00]: those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's critical that you
partner with not only a good EU licensee,
[SPEAKER_00]: but partner with a good European familiar
logistics company and supply chain company
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can not have your product
sitting at the port gathering dust or
[SPEAKER_00]: rotting as it sits in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got some recommendations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna go through them all,
but here's some of the top five markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and some areas where you might wanna look
at positioning your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really three big
opportunities, pharma, medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: and consumer product goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD falls into all three of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really important to knowing what
market you wanna get into, having a
[SPEAKER_00]: vision, taking advantage of that,
and really committing to it rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be all things to all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very rarely successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important also,
given how dynamic the market is,
[SPEAKER_00]: to remain very, very nimble and adjust to
the market conditions as they change,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna switch gears a little bit to
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of discussion today about
hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp has a long tradition in the EU,
mainly on the fiber and grain side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now there's this emerging CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have here is a number of acres planted,
and a number of acres that were planted
[SPEAKER_00]: that's associated with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally, it's about 56, 60% is dedicated
to CBD of the planted acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe 50% or so in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's not enough demand and you
start importing from Canada, from the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: from China, there could be a pretty
significant impact on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: both here and abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at the market somewhat
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like a lot of the analysts right now
are focused on the retail demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the capacity in the market,
how much can the market supply?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really shifts your focus a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the forecasts right now are so
dynamic out there that it's tough to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand who's the most accurate and
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some problems with forecasting
these days, especially given the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic data systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm forecasting that the EU has enough
capacity on the hemp side, CBD side,
[SPEAKER_00]: to satisfy $4.3 billion in retail demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based upon isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do this for full spectrum or
whatever, but I just chose isolate because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the lowest yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a high cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's lots of forecasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending upon which forecast you
believe, there's either too much supply of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD from the Europeans or there's not
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's not enough, then that's
great for importation, for exporters from
[SPEAKER_00]: other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's too little, or if there's
too much, then that's problematic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in Europe, for CBD,
the opportunity is good, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: panacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna plant some plants,
harvest them, and then get rich and live
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mallorca or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everybody will win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of an outlook, well,
CBD is sexy for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunities for fiber and grain is
transformational.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's opportunities in automotive,
in textiles, in plastics, in construction,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially on the fiber side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's strong opportunities in grain
as well for animal and human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my best advice is establish
relationships now develop the supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain, partner with EU members,
and then partner with people abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then expect price decreases as the
market settles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pick a path, you can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the topic of full federal legalization
has been in a lot of the media,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some bills that have been
proposed that could be really just
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market, the higher THC side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of the bills, namely the more
recent CAOA and the Moore Act on the House
[SPEAKER_00]: side is they're not expected to pass,
but they're setting kind of a dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: precedent for policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But assuming that those don't pass,
there's still a movement afoot to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: full federal legalization in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact that this will have will be
rather profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll accelerate the pace of reform
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will influence international treaties
because cannabis is demonized throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will draw the attention also into
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now some of the policies being
proposed allow for immediate importation
[SPEAKER_00]: from other countries into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the focus right now is on the EU,
there's going to be a lot of opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: on the export side into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: given that international suppliers will
have a competitive advantage relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers if a lot of these policies are
implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this will lead to an expansion of
the global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll introduce opportunities on
practically every continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately, as the market
settles, then proximity to markets will
[SPEAKER_00]: play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suppliers in Azerbaijan will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suppliers in Central and South America
and Mexico will focus on the North
[SPEAKER_00]: American market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that sense, as the dust settles,
there'll be this proximity play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now is the time to set up
those relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meanwhile, this whole
regulatory murkiness, regardless of if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's local, in Germany, in Switzerland,
in South America and North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: that remains the number one risk to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that's settled, then it's really
tough to understand the rules of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tough to understand your
business plans, your profitability and the
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, well, I want to thank the
ICBC team for this opportunity to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a great first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got another speaker coming up,
which will talk about investment and like
[SPEAKER_00]: in both cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this marketplace is very dynamic right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of folks are thinking that
they're fatigued, that they've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this for four or five, 10 years,
and they're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do operate, be sure to think
about this global opportunity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: global competition and the global supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're thinking about that global
situation and global environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: be sure to act local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, right now, cannabis is a
local phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take some questions if I have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can describe a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm interested in your assessment that
when US is changing, the legislation in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe will follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes you believe that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were a lot of US companies
who thought putting the boot on the
[SPEAKER_02]: grounds will change Europe and move to the
US attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did not see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see Tesla now failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you think it will do so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because exchanging with the International
Narcotic Control Board, I don't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the question is why do I think
that the US legalization will have an
[SPEAKER_00]: influence on the European market?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I view this is that when you
have a large market and they legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use, then there's this ripple
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw in the United States on the West
Coast, one state legalized, then the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same type of phenomena will occur
from country to country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the US is legal and there's this
great opportunity, then not only does it
[SPEAKER_00]: drive these international treaties and
changes to the UN, UNODC, and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other policies, but those policies have
been restricting the growth of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by influencing these treaties and by
driving this cascade effect through
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization at the adult use level,
it will have this contagion that will
[SPEAKER_00]: carry over into the European market and
then elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for this very
informative speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Luke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a cannabis filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really loved your last point,
like this think global, act local.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first cannabis reference was visiting
the Himalayan mountains in Nepal,
[SPEAKER_03]: witnessing minorities excluded from
society using wild plants for good for
[SPEAKER_03]: establishing a very local, beneficial
economy model that is basically beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is like, how do we get
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: We are talking about legislations,
laws, like so much bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just taking your last point, for me,
it seems like the easiest way to make this
[SPEAKER_03]: think global, act local point happen is to
just leave everyone using the plant the
[SPEAKER_03]: way they want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the way that regulatory
structures are operating is they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: control things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that cannabis is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they're trying to reform,
they're still trying to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on the hemp side, they're treating it
as though it's illegal, even though for
[SPEAKER_00]: the most part, it's been generally
legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think on the local side,
when there's job creation where everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: has a story about their cannabis use and
their cannabis story, they got into the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry because of their sister or their
brother or their wife or their husband
[SPEAKER_00]: because of some ailment that cannabis has
been used to help address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those localized stories that really
change policy and generate momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think on the act local side,
it's more about how to drive reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other comment on that,
I've been giving a lot of speeches around
[SPEAKER_00]: the globe recently, but I've been speaking
to small audiences in some instances like
[SPEAKER_00]: city councils, mayors, police departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they see the value and that the
plant actually does a lot of wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: things, then they tend to be more willing
to embrace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that educational process, it takes
time and you have to do it on a city by
[SPEAKER_00]: city, community by community basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really at this point, it's still
very, very local.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, thanks for all the data material
you shared with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask you about what you said
about regulation in Europe and how it
[SPEAKER_04]: would affect the global market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty surprised about that because
I wouldn't have expected that USA would
[SPEAKER_04]: have an eye on European regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: In which fields exactly and why and how do
you think European regulation could
[SPEAKER_04]: affect, for example, US market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so currently in the US, there are
some standards, but they're not very
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform or widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, there could be some
public safety issues associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that the market's operating right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by having an example like EU GMP
certification, if that becomes the de
[SPEAKER_00]: facto standard in the United States,
then there's this public safety element
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think on the public safety side,
this is where Europe has the lead right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and are starting to influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And given the fact that there's so much
focus on the European market, people want
[SPEAKER_00]: to conform to that standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be a differentiating factor
for operators in these other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have these standards already
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it'll take kind of the
wild west out of the American market and
[SPEAKER_00]: other markets and will actually drive
responsible practices throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fine then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not running all the way back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's hear it one more time for
Beau Whitney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
