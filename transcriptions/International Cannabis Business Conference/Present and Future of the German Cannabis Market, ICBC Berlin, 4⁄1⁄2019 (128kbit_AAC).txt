[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lovely to see you and it's a great
privilege to host a conversation at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of respect for Alex Rogers
and I think this is one of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis conferences that happens which is
why we have made an effort to come from
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada to come and be here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever I'm asked to host a panel I
find that it's an opportunity for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about something that I don't know
about and I seek out experts who have the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge that I don't have to study the
subject and then to come and share with
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't really understand the
complicated nuances of the German
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape for physicians and patients and
I wanted to understand it also with a
[SPEAKER_02]: global lens on what the experience is for
both physicians and patients and these are
[SPEAKER_02]: the experts that have been teaching me and
now we're going to share with you what our
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love to first introduce to you
Mr. Burkhard Blinard on the far end here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I am learning that he is a bit of a
hero in these realms in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. Blinard was a member of the German
Parliament until 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a member of the Social Democratic
Party and he was responsible for the
[SPEAKER_02]: budget of the Federal Ministry of Health
and the drug policy spokesperson for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Social Democratic Party but he played a
decisive role in shaping Germany's drug
[SPEAKER_02]: policy for the past four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: During his time in the Parliament Mr.
Blinard was instrumental in the
[SPEAKER_02]: development of Germany's law on medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main objectives he had was to
give patients access to cost-free medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and he is directly responsible
for making Germany's medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation more patient-friendly and less
bureaucratic in several key ways right
[SPEAKER_02]: before it was passed which we will
discuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: On my right is Dr. Mark Ware, a dear
friend and colleague.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ware has spent over 20 years
researching uses of medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching other physicians how to integrate
cannabis into their clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is Canopy Growth's chief medical
officer and is responsible for the
[SPEAKER_02]: company's clinical research arm,
Canopy Health Innovations and Spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an associate professor in family
medicine at McGill University and
[SPEAKER_02]: continues to practice pain medicine at the
McGill University Health Centre.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also acted as a key advisor on
medical cannabis policy to the Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: government in 2001 and he is recognized
globally as a leader in medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: He flew all last night to get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark has been traveling and working a lot
around the world with governments and
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians lately and we're very lucky for
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: to have made the effort to come and be
here with us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my left is Dr. Sebastian Schulz
who's the director of communications and
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing for Spectrum Cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: His research is focused on the philosophy
of neurocognition with a special focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: the psychotropic effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's published many articles and three
books regarding his research and he has
[SPEAKER_02]: been working intimately with the medical
cannabis market since it began in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to know how many of you
live in Germany?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and how many of you are from other
parts of Europe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how many from North America?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha, and do we have anybody from Asia in
the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hello Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did anybody make it all the way from
Africa?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of you are from a country that
has some kind of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I hope next year that we see more
hands in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see where the ladies are.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many women do we have in the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, excellent, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we have any physicians in the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful, lovely to have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there anybody in the room who has
been working with patients in Germany
[SPEAKER_02]: helping them to navigate the process here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any patient advocates in the
room?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wonderful, I would love to speak with
you afterwards please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, always a real passion for talking to
the people that are helping patients to
[SPEAKER_02]: navigate the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things are changing rapidly in terms of
reform around medical cannabis around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world and in Germany and I always believe
that it's really important to take a look
[SPEAKER_02]: back and to have an understanding of where
we came from as we're looking forward into
[SPEAKER_02]: our future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are going to start with a little bit
of a history lesson about how we got to
[SPEAKER_02]: where we are in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. Blenerd, would you tell us a little
bit about how medical cannabis became
[SPEAKER_02]: legal in Germany?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a bit about the catalyst and what
the process was like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you very much for the question,
for me the opportunity to say the
[SPEAKER_03]: introductory words here.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'm sorry that you always
have to use these translators because I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't speak English so fluently that
everyone would understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it helped when I can just
describe in German how the story has been.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me it has also been a field year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am neither a physician, I am not a
lawyer, I am a political scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was confronted with the topic in
2013 and with all the facets that have to
[SPEAKER_03]: do with cannabis, medical cannabis and
general drug policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me it was relatively clear
relatively quickly that in the area of
[SPEAKER_03]: medical use in Germany there are actually
decades, centuries of experience that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a long history with it, which at some
point broke off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that we have the chance to take the
big step, namely to make a law that allows
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis to be used in medicine again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was difficult in the big coalition for
the insiders here in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a federal government led by the
CDU and the SPD in 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one part of the government actually
has no interest in doing anything right in
this area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we didn't have the laws,
if we didn't have the laws that allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: the patient in the course of time,
because they complained, because they
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to know what they had successfully
used for themselves and that's why they
[SPEAKER_03]: needed the exemption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we didn't have the courts that
supported exactly these patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we wouldn't have made the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: First the courts actually put the policy
under pressure, namely the health
[SPEAKER_03]: minister.
[SPEAKER_03]: They then made the claim, they tried to
delay it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end it was good that we did it
in the period of the legislature.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, the impetus was actually that
courts allowed two patients in Germany to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow cannabis themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the own cultivation was for one part
in the government something that they
[SPEAKER_03]: could not imagine at all, that there would
then be more people who could grow
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in their gardens, wherever on the
balconies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why the pressure was to make a
law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we actually took the usual path,
as laws in Germany are also made.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a referendum draft, there is a
long debate, hearings, scientific support.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, the night of the decision,
where the third reading in Germany had to
[SPEAKER_03]: come to the Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And except for the last push, we then
tried to implement changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy and proud of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The law then reached 100 percent approval
in the Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that for a law where we talk about
cannabis in Germany, that is something
[SPEAKER_03]: actually historical.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's two years in force.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, today is April 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Germany there is April 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always send people somewhere into the
desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we've had it for two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to make it better, reform it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the big step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from my conversation experience,
I always like to tell the story of how it
[SPEAKER_03]: came about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I already notice that many,
many other countries are currently looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the advantages that exist here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what can we do to make sure that we
can implement the same good law,
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps also in our country?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least in this area, Germany has once
again, thank God, been leading in many
[SPEAKER_03]: other areas, back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this area, I actually experience a
lot of approval, also outside of Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I was able to contribute to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, in the final hours before the
proposed law became legislation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you fought very hard in the last hours for
a couple of very important changes for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sebastian, you have been navigating the
medical framework in Germany since it
[SPEAKER_02]: became law two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a particular awareness of the patient
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering if you can speak to us
about some of the unique aspects of the
[SPEAKER_02]: German medical cannabis landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's very important for me to start
with the perspective of the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I agree very much with Burkhard
Blienert that this law is a huge leap for
[SPEAKER_05]: this country and for a lot of other
countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of patients we are now seeing,
we're all sitting here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it enabled a lot of patients to get
access.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, when I hear about the details of
what you told me, it's an amazing process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really can value much more when I
hear about the details of how it came to
[SPEAKER_05]: that law, how much you moved there.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the patients, though, in the last two
years, it's been a very painful
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to get access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was because I give you only a few
aspects of that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thousand patients who had managed to
get special licenses before the law came
[SPEAKER_05]: to place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like around a thousand patients who
got special permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were not just renewed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had to run through the system
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them didn't get their
medication and didn't get approved by
[SPEAKER_05]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really painful for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other patients who were then able to
access cannabis were bounced back from
[SPEAKER_05]: their doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of them were rejected because the
doctors, of course, they didn't know the
[SPEAKER_05]: new law.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't know how to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them just wanted to know,
how do I do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the dosing?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the beginning, it was really hard
for them to get to their medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: The prices went up for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna talk about the reasons later.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the patients only received
private prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could say, hey, prices,
why would that matter to the German
[SPEAKER_05]: patients?
[SPEAKER_05]: They get reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning, only 30% of the
applications went through.
[SPEAKER_05]: The insurances were slow to understand the
new law, probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they rejected a lot of the
applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for many patients, it was very
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we heard it before,
supply was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the LPs coming in here and everybody
who had distributed cannabis, we all had
[SPEAKER_05]: supply issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market exploded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so really, we were able to give
medication to a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_05]: to give medical cannabis to a lot more
patients, but it was not easy to give it
[SPEAKER_05]: to them consistently and having it all
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's really important to have
that patient perspective and to understand
[SPEAKER_05]: the German market because it also shows
you how much frustration was there and how
[SPEAKER_05]: much criticism was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there definitely need to be some
improvements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me about two things?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear more about regress
and also your ability to communicate with
[SPEAKER_02]: and educate and support patients in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would like to talk generally a
little bit more about the regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Germany, and then I will pick up the
regressions first thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Germany, every doctor, except for
dentists and veterinarians, is allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's effectively a no-label substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is classified as an ingredient to a
medication, which gives it that status.
[SPEAKER_05]: A problem with that is that pharmacists
then have to make an identity test and put
[SPEAKER_05]: 100% price margin on the product,
which makes cannabis exceedingly expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: in the international comparison here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like 22 euros a gram or something
around that, approximately, depending on
[SPEAKER_05]: how it's handled.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a no-label drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, the law states that it has
to be reimbursed, except for exceptional
[SPEAKER_05]: cases where the medical services of the
insurance say, no, that's not a case where
[SPEAKER_05]: we reimburse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a very special situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regress situation that you were
talking about is one where doctors,
[SPEAKER_05]: we heard that a lot from doctors,
they were afraid to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, many doctors didn't want to
prescribe for reimbursement because they
[SPEAKER_05]: were like, oh, we have to go through,
they also have to go through a
[SPEAKER_05]: non-interventional form where they have to
make observations about patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have paperwork to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a difficult process to go through
the application.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were afraid then also,
we heard that a lot from doctors,
[SPEAKER_05]: that they would get a regress problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would mean that the doctors actually,
for their patients, they get the
[SPEAKER_05]: applications for them to get reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But later, the insurances would have the
ability to come back to them after a year
[SPEAKER_05]: or so and to evaluate the prescription
patterns and say, hey, you're prescribing
[SPEAKER_05]: a very expensive medicine, so maybe we're
taking away the money from you that you've
[SPEAKER_05]: taken out of the health system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of doctors, we haven't seen that
happening yet, but in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_05]: that was a big factor for doctors where
they were like, whoops, we are not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that blew me away when I learned that,
that if the insurance agencies assess that
[SPEAKER_02]: a doctor is overprescribing cannabis and
is taxing the insurance system too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can go back and personally take that
money out of a physician's bank account.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty serious deterrent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you very much, Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem now, Schilders,
that we actually have at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to reiterate the intention of
the legislator, what we actually intended.
[SPEAKER_03]: From my point of view, one of the most
important points is that a patient first
[SPEAKER_03]: of all did not have to be out-therapized.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have erased that, that was in there
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an important point in the
question, does the MDK have a chance,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lever, maybe then still the approval,
then not to speak out, and so the cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptance would then fall through the
legal health insurance in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's one of the most
important points that we actually
[SPEAKER_03]: implemented, that it is not necessarily,
since there are restrictions in the
[SPEAKER_03]: therapy freedom of the doctor,
first a patient has to actually have the
[SPEAKER_03]: path of suffering through steps before he
actually gets cannabis in different
[SPEAKER_03]: indications.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing is that the MDK actually
does not necessarily have to say no,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he should, the reason for the
hindrance for the MDK to reject something,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have increased, that is an important
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the evidence is missing at this
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the doctor use which indications
and how does he implement it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can understand that, but he should not
be able to do it per se through one,
[SPEAKER_03]: two, three levers, that he could reject it
as an MDK.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the interface of MDK.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other interface in palliative
medicine, we needed an extremely short
[SPEAKER_03]: approval by the MDK, that also came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, I think, then the third point in
this case, according to the therapy
[SPEAKER_03]: freedom, according to non-ostherapy,
the point in palliative medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: to implement as quickly as possible,
so that the patients can actually get the
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage that cannabis is used there very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the intention of the legislator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a comment on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are extremely valuable points and I
now, seeing the German market,
[SPEAKER_05]: how it unfolded, I can see how much of an
effect, of a positive effect, those last
[SPEAKER_05]: changes you made, you just mentioned had.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to mention two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I said, the no label situation is,
of course, if you look at Ralph Mishulam's
[SPEAKER_05]: talk, Professor Ralph Mishulam's talk,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a doctor here is not bound to
indications, and we know that there's such
[SPEAKER_05]: a huge wide spectrum of illnesses and
indications where cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to understand the dynamics
of the German market, then you have to see
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is this wide range where you can
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: The insurances have to cover, and now the
insurances came back in the last years to
[SPEAKER_05]: say, oh wait, the evidence situation for
some of those indications is not really
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You understand the dynamics of the German
market really well if you see that no
[SPEAKER_05]: label situation and reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will circle back around to talking more
about evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, both of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Ware, you have been teaching about the
use of medical cannabis in clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: practice for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you have been working in many
regions around the world recently as
[SPEAKER_02]: countries are evolving their framework
around medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if you can speak a little
bit about the physician experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the worldwide physician
experience, and how it may differ from
[SPEAKER_02]: what's happening in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Hilary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think probably instead of contrasting it
with what's happening in Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's important to say that around the
world, one of the single biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges to the adoption of medical
cannabis as a therapy is the fact that
[SPEAKER_04]: physicians are the ones who have to write
the prescription or the authorization.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the gatekeepers to this therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rightly or wrongly, in some jurisdictions,
nurse practitioners have this ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: In others, there are other health
professionals who can do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by and large, around the world,
it is a healthcare professional or
[SPEAKER_04]: physician who has the responsibility to
decide whether this is an appropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: therapy for the patient based on the
guidance that they receive from their
[SPEAKER_04]: government, based on their regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the vast majority of physicians have
no idea what cannabis is, how it works,
[SPEAKER_04]: what the endocannabinoid system is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are remarkably uneducated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a phenomenal barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenge to educating physicians,
to putting endocannabinoid physiology in
[SPEAKER_04]: medical schools, in teaching practitioners
about using cannabis is there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: government incentive for government to do
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The medical schools aren't stepping up and
putting this into their curricula.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's falling on the industry to provide
this education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that creates another problem because
the cannabis industry is coming on the
[SPEAKER_04]: back of a long history of pharmaceutical
companies having behaved rather badly when
[SPEAKER_04]: it comes to teaching physicians about
their medicines, taking them for expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: holidays and paying their wives to come on
their trips with them and taking them for
[SPEAKER_04]: fancy dinners and spending money on these
physicians, knowing full well that that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of behavior would influence their
prescribing practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is now being regulated against,
and we're hearing stories of big pharma
[SPEAKER_04]: companies being punished and being fined
and in some cases even being taken to
[SPEAKER_04]: court for some of the practices they've
done with respect to physician education.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how is the industry supposed to respond
to educating the people who are supposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to be providing this medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a phenomenal problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's global.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it requires a really
interesting, the role of the nonprofit
[SPEAKER_04]: networks, the role of the patient advocacy
organizations, somehow building an arm's
[SPEAKER_04]: length between the industry and the doctor
so that the education gets where it needs
[SPEAKER_04]: to go, but isn't seen as an incentive or a
payment to the physician to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some really dodgy practices
happening out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have to be very careful
that in the aim of educating physicians,
[SPEAKER_04]: we aren't committing the same crimes that
our predecessors in the pharma industry
[SPEAKER_04]: have committed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sebastian is talking about the hunger
for more clinical research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's true in Germany and I think
it's true in many places around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, we have approximately 1% of our
population is registered legal medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the ratio was the same in Germany,
that would mean that we would have almost
[SPEAKER_02]: 800,000 people in Germany, and we're
currently at 40,000 people in Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: approximately, that are using the legal
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if you can talk a little
bit about the acceleration of research
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening around the world and what
you see that's coming on the horizon that
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to fill some of these needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's coupled with the physician
education, because when you speak to,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I speak to roomfuls like this,
but they're all physicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there are two doctors in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a lot more meetings where the room
is filled with physicians and not as much
[SPEAKER_04]: business guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: No disrespect intended, but those are the
people we have to be speaking to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they will always stand up and say,
well, there isn't enough evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the data?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are the clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is the proof that it works?
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard a panelist earlier just saying,
you know, it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, but the doctors don't think it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They aren't being given the data in the
same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to design ways to get evidence
to them, which will then help them make
[SPEAKER_04]: these decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So education is one part, but supplying
the evidence is the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are sort of two main ways of doing
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is through the standard randomized
control trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a double blind experiment where
people are put on either the drug or
[SPEAKER_04]: placebo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really is considered as the gold
standard of therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these studies require very very
tightly controlled products, for one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they require a lot of time and a lot
of expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to invest in the kind of data to get
drugs into the clinical trial and into the
[SPEAKER_04]: pipeline where they're approved as
medicines costs tens, if not hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: millions of dollars to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there has to be an investment in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I predict that in 10,
20 years, we will see far more cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines approved as therapies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to change the story
completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to take a long time to get
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing we can do is actually
provide patients with access to cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: products and track their real world
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this idea of real world evidence is
actually being now reviewed by regulators
[SPEAKER_04]: as a significant way of evaluating the
effectiveness of drugs and other medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: not just cannabis, but other drugs as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's two concepts here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is efficacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: A clinical trial will tell you if the drug
is efficacious or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't tell you if it's effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Effective is a real world situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it working for patients at large?
[SPEAKER_04]: And vast majority of people using cannabis
are not clinical trial subjects.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are people with other problems,
other diseases, taking other medications
[SPEAKER_04]: who probably wouldn't fit into the
standard clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So following these patients as real world
evidence studies, open label studies,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the second arm of research that I
think we can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this satisfies two major problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is getting patients access to the
products and getting data to help inform
[SPEAKER_04]: physicians in future education.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's the approach we need to
take in terms of developing evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy has undertaken supporting quite a
lot of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's two particular projects that
I'm wondering if you would share with us
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is I'm wondering if you can talk about
the professorship at the University of
[SPEAKER_02]: British Columbia and the clinical science
that's happening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And second, I'm wondering if you can talk
a little bit about the research in the
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term care facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Hilary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sure, I'll touch quickly on these two
major issues in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not the only ones,
but they're very sort of front and center
[SPEAKER_04]: in the discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the use of cannabis to help reduce
the opioid abuse epidemic, the opioid
[SPEAKER_04]: overdose crisis, whatever you choose to
call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a massive problem in North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thousands of people are dying every month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really a crisis of epic
proportions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a potential that cannabis and
cannabinoid medicines may assist in
[SPEAKER_04]: changing the direction of this epidemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor M.J.
[SPEAKER_04]: Milloy and his colleagues at the
University of British Columbia received a
[SPEAKER_04]: grant from Canopy, from the University of
British Columbia, and from the government
[SPEAKER_04]: of B.C., very much led by Hilary's
leadership, I should add, that this gift
[SPEAKER_04]: to Dr. Milloy's team is enabling him to
spend $2.5 million on evaluating whether
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis can be helpful in helping people
wean off intravenous street drugs,
[SPEAKER_04]: crack cocaine, methamphetamines,
opioids, you name it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a potential there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is happening at the street level,
where they're going into the communities
[SPEAKER_04]: most affected and helping administer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This needs support.
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of humanitarian crisis needs
this kind of intervention.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're very proud to support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other big issue is the nursing homes,
where people with agitated dementias,
[SPEAKER_04]: people in elderly care, long-term care
facilities, are being asked, or their
[SPEAKER_04]: loved ones are approaching the units,
the centers, if they can put their
[SPEAKER_04]: grandparents, their parents, their loved
ones on cannabis because they think it
[SPEAKER_04]: helps them reduce the dementias and the
agitation, help them sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are also people who are taking
pretty strong antipsychotics, benzos,
[SPEAKER_04]: opioids, to control them and help them
sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's good anecdotal evidence that this
is helping, but we're proposing to follow
[SPEAKER_04]: these people by administering properly
cannabinoid therapies and then tracking
[SPEAKER_04]: over time in a real-world manner what is
the experience, what are the medication
[SPEAKER_04]: use patterns, profiles changing,
and this study is ongoing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two very different populations,
but by taking compassionate approaches,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can provide medicines to people,
but also track what happens in the real
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canopy actually developed a new
administration form in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with long-term care facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created soft gels, which is essentially
little capsules because the folks
[SPEAKER_02]: administering medicines in long-term care
facilities didn't want to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medicine needed to be stored and
administered in the same way as all of
[SPEAKER_02]: their other medications were, which drove
some innovation on our end, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hope that we can see that there is
evidence on the horizon that's coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to give clinicians what they need
to lean on to feel more comfortable using
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in their practice, but there are
some other factors that are potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be accelerants in the landscape
in Germany that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak to that, please?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, of course, we're expecting
the supply situation to get a lot better
[SPEAKER_05]: in the near future, of course,
because we have to deliver GMP products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see that a lot from patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have very limited abilities to talk to
patients because of the German advertising
[SPEAKER_05]: laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: We basically are restricted to talking to
a pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to doctors, healthcare practitioners.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they don't see is that GMP
facilities have to build up first,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we have to construct them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a very complicated, super
high-tech process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a facility now in Odense and
Denmark that's going to deliver a lot to
[SPEAKER_05]: the market, and others are building up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the supply situation, not only in terms
of quantity, but also in terms of having
[SPEAKER_05]: various varieties of cannabis in terms of
flowers, but also extracts and other
[SPEAKER_05]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: That will completely change the market,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: A second thing is that we see the
insurance's approval rates going up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I would like to add something
to what Mark said, real-world evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a situation where the insurances have
to cover no-label substance, so to say,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're like, well, we're covering now
costs for somebody who has fibromyalgia,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we don't see really the evidence out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will have to introduce also
socioeconomic data.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, showing in the country that
cannabis can save costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see that already from the Canadian
market and from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market, that in many places for years and
years, the co-medication went down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have studies on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can show for those places that,
yes, patients who are using cannabis are
[SPEAKER_05]: using less other substances and are less
costly for the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be very important for
the German system.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have done also, if we compare the
Canadian and the German market,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have to always remember, and this is
one of the most important points,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I keep on telling people like a
mantra, the Canadian market started 15
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago or longer in 2001.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can use all the experience and
the world, so the recognition of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: as a medicine is a completely different
stage now worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we profit from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought in Canadian doctors here to
teach German doctors about their
[SPEAKER_05]: experience, really on a very how-to-do
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that helped us a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's gonna be other, not only
clinical and other evidence coming in,
[SPEAKER_05]: but socioeconomic data will be generated
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a lot of factors that will
even accelerate a market where we already
[SPEAKER_05]: have seen an explosion of patient numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just let me add one last comment about the
number of 40,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was published by the Handelsblatt
last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Health-related data in Germany are very
sensitive, so these are really rough
[SPEAKER_05]: estimates.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really can't extract exact numbers from
those data, mainly also because many
[SPEAKER_05]: doctors make private prescriptions and we
can't really track them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't know if 50, 60, 80% of the
prescriptions that are being done here are
[SPEAKER_05]: private and we cannot really track those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mark, some of the growing pains that
Germany is going through around the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis landscape seem to echo
some of the things that we experienced in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now in Canada with almost 400,000
licensed legal patients, we've seen an
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible increase in the past couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering if you can speak to the
factors that you think really stabilized
[SPEAKER_02]: and encouraged more physicians to start
using cannabis in their practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did we see such a big uptake in the
last few years?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a couple of things probably
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the trajectory of Canadian
cannabis patients over 20 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: it began very, very slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the trajectory really only began to
pick up in the last five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happened at the same time as there
were changes in the regulatory framework,
[SPEAKER_04]: which allowed for, there was a time in
Canada where you only had one producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was only one type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a while it was restricted to 5%.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Conroy probably remembers these days
very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: One kind of cannabis grown in underground
mines in Flintlawn, Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this was a limiting factor to just
adoption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They needed more access.
[SPEAKER_04]: So over the last five to 10 years,
we saw increasing numbers of suppliers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw ranges of products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that ability for patients to
have access to a wider range made them
[SPEAKER_04]: more engaged in the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing was that the government
began to allow the companies that were
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed to produce cannabis to make oils,
extracts, soft gels, and alternative forms
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis products that weren't just
cannabis flour, which of course was
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with smoking, even though there
are medical devices approved as devices
[SPEAKER_04]: for delivering vapor to patients in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this availability of other form
factors, I think, was another thing for
[SPEAKER_04]: many physicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: A soft gel or an oil that contains so many
milligrams of product per milliliter is a
[SPEAKER_04]: much more easy thing to think about as a
medicine than a gram of dried flour at 18%
[SPEAKER_04]: THC and 1% CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: For most physicians, this doesn't really
mean much to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't get what that, many doctors
probably don't know what a gram of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this idea that they could have gel
caps and oils and bottles and syringes
[SPEAKER_04]: where they could administer more titrated
doses, I think this was a big factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly surprised many of us that the
patients also responded to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was around the end of last year for
the first time that we saw the sale of
[SPEAKER_04]: oils and soft gels actually exceeding the
sale of dried flour in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sale of dried flour actually
started dropping off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So patients were responding to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It appears to be working for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, it's a relatively new
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stabilizing it and making them
reproducible is another challenge,
[SPEAKER_04]: as anyone who does this work will realize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making it into a pharmaceutical capsule is
still a little bit of a ways away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But under the Canadian regulations,
it was allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that was a big change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: One short, another accelerating factor
that I see in Germany is now the first
[SPEAKER_05]: adopters here using full spectrum cannabis
flowers and extracts are first they looked
[SPEAKER_05]: at the metadata and they looked at the
situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're seeing patients coming back to
them and saying, oh, this helped me with
[SPEAKER_05]: this and this and this and this and this
and that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are actually seeing the cases and
we had we talked to many of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for doctors and they have a lot of
weight on their shoulders in Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: because and that I forgot to mention that
before.
[SPEAKER_05]: They really prescribe the product in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like they give you a prescription
for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually put down the product that
you're going to get in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for them, it's a lot of weight on
their shoulders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they hear it from German doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They hear it from German doctors that this
works.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are seeing the cases and this is
going to accelerate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in this year, this is going to
accelerate because it's becoming tangible
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just like Canadian experience and
the metadata situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just want to support that because
I think word of mouth is tremendously
[SPEAKER_04]: popular or tremendously powerful in this
approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doctors talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not getting this information from
their medical schools, from their
[SPEAKER_04]: associations, from their various
syndicates.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hearing it from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they try it and they see a few
patients that benefit and if they know how
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it properly, they then see these
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of the growth,
there are something like 17,000 physicians
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada now who have written at least
one authorization and that's about 12,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 percent of the Canadian physicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because they're being taught about it
by the industry or by their medical
[SPEAKER_04]: schools, but because they're learning and
telling each other about this and their
[SPEAKER_04]: patients are coming and telling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a kind of a groundswell of
education that's happening just from pure
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many patients are learning the same
way, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients supporting each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: The role of the doctors in the legislation
process is also known and important.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the burden, they have the
responsibility at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we actually wrote it in,
that there should be further education
[SPEAKER_03]: offers through the doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_03]: That there is a permanent post-work
obligation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was also right.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the evaluation now, we actually have to
demand that we also capture all these
points.
[SPEAKER_03]: That the state, ultimately the legislator,
is responsible for ensuring that we also
[SPEAKER_03]: learn from these experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: What goes wrong or do we have too little
in the field and where do we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: control it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other point, the question of research,
was our concern, actually my concern too,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we start a state-funded promotion.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we are already preparing the way
because we absolutely need this research
[SPEAKER_03]: for the evidence, for the credibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there the legislator actually has to
slowly catch up, also to create the
[SPEAKER_03]: framework conditions that we get a
completely different structure from the
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences worldwide, of course,
but especially here in Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to learn from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a story right now in the early
stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: After two years, I find it urgently
necessary that we put a signal there,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, we want, we want to go in there and
that is necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third point, actually,
where the federal government should be
[SPEAKER_03]: active now, from my point of view,
is to change international framework
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to be the driver, to look closer,
where can we go with CBD and the
[SPEAKER_03]: assessment, what is the approach there,
because we absolutely need these
[SPEAKER_03]: international regulations to make it
easier, of course, here in Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: to implement it legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the federal government can really
take the lead and be at the forefront
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Blener, speaking of new laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking of new laws, there is a new
proposed bill in your parliament and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that this is not a law that you have
written, so you might not like it as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as you did the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm wondering if you can speak to us
about the proposed bill and whether and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you think that what the implications
will be for patients and physicians and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you think the likelihood is of it
becoming law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, what the Minister of Health has
suggested, two points, that is already
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable and correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first point is to work on the question
of the price of pharmacies, the pharmacy
[SPEAKER_03]: supply.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second point, with a follow-up
medication, there must not be a new
[SPEAKER_03]: application.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are already good levers that you
should definitely take.
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion was actually that right at
the beginning of the legislature period,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have made a round table,
to bring together the people involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: the doctors, the pharmacists, the
manufacturers, the politicians,
[SPEAKER_03]: and to look at the patient
representatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is the gap, what are the points that
can be regulated under the law and what do
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to implement?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the moment, we have a law with two
important points.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they come, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the opposition, which has its own
proposals.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is just the parliamentary business,
but we are losing time and we are not
[SPEAKER_03]: pragmatic in the way that we can do this
better and do it faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, we are now going back into the
troubles of party politics, of the
[SPEAKER_03]: majority and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, especially because it was just a
new law, for a not so innovative way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a round table would have been much,
much better for me, where we quickly,
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps also the problems, the concerns of
the hospitals, that the costs are rising.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question of the doctors with regress,
the question of the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_03]: How will they eventually sit on the costs
if the recipe is wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could have named and clarified that
much better and then implemented the
[SPEAKER_03]: necessary steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would have led to an increase
in the acceptance of the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would have realized that the people
who are actually listening right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: can help and so on, are currently rising
in the age range.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the 60-plus generation that is
looking at it enormously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can it help me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because especially in age, the problems
with arthrosis, pain, etc.
come.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to adjust to these changes as
a legislator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would have wished that politics
would have been a bit more sensitive in
[SPEAKER_03]: the last 16 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. Blinard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's an incredible thing that as a
part of the German law, that healthcare
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance has been covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things that we're still
fighting for in Canada, for patients to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to afford their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that particular aspect of
the legislation that you're responsible
[SPEAKER_02]: for, you've shown tremendous global
leadership and you have set the standard
[SPEAKER_02]: for hopefully the rest of Europe and the
rest of the country that I hope will catch
[SPEAKER_02]: up with your vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is all of the time that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to really acknowledge and thank my
fellow panelists who are incredibly busy
[SPEAKER_02]: creating medical cannabis access around
the world, who have been working on it for
[SPEAKER_02]: a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: We maybe have time for one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have time for one question?
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks very excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe two questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys both look excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at our MedPayRx workshops, we're
bringing in doctors, we're bringing in
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacists, manufacturers, distributors,
etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm often thinking, you're talking
about how to advocate, but does a company
[SPEAKER_06]: like yours, do you actually have a
blueprint that we can actually follow here
[SPEAKER_06]: in Germany, how to take the steps to
actually go about organizing the doctors
[SPEAKER_06]: and educating them?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a blueprint that already exists
that we can follow?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go back pre-canopy to my McGill days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we published a paper in a journal
called the Clinical Pharmacology and
[SPEAKER_04]: Therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we actually published what we call the
cannabis curriculum, which was a kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: step-by-step guide of what doctors should
know about the plant and biology and
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid safety, efficacy,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there do exist these templates.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way in which you deliver that to
physicians depends on the jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of doctors like to learn in small
groups so they can talk to each other and
[SPEAKER_04]: exchange information and ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some like to learn online, so the idea of
having online webinars or modules that
[SPEAKER_04]: they can go and check in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important that these programs
be accredited by their governing agency so
[SPEAKER_04]: they get credit for doing the courses.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is often a huge currency for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this actually speaks to the
government's willingness to inform them,
[SPEAKER_04]: because if they can get 12 CME credits for
having done into medical education,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can tick a box that says,
yes, I did some training.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some CME credits, which is good for
my medical board that shows that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: getting my CMEs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm learning something cool and new.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of doctors, this is a
totally new and exciting area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they get into it, they start
going, holy shit, I had no idea that this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff was doing what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you've got another excited person
to lead the discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just creating the focus any way that
they like it so that it's accredited and
[SPEAKER_04]: comprehensive should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't intended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh, the troublemaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say this isn't intended as
a cross-examination question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was, I would say, isn't it true
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, John, I'm used to you defending me
and having my back, not being on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to comment on Dr. Ware's
remarks about research and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned as a lawyer that there were,
what, some 10 royal commissions of inquiry
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to 1893.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Indian Hemp Drug Commission up to at
least our Senate, what, in 2003.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 20,000 med studies up there that
you can access online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And significantly, I think, in terms of
the opiate crisis, the National Academy of
[SPEAKER_01]: Science, Engineering, and Medicine
surveyed all of the existing studies,
[SPEAKER_01]: commented on how difficult it has been to
do the research, but said, notwithstanding
[SPEAKER_01]: that, there is conclusive evidence that it
is effective for chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the problem, doctors,
in terms of, you know, there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we can always do more studies,
but as you pointed out, Dr. Malloy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: group at UBC and St. Paul's is doing a
tremendous job and have reduced opiate
[SPEAKER_01]: deaths so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come on, medical profession,
get on board.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's the medical
profession.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're expecting politicians to have
common sense, which is hard to find all
[SPEAKER_07]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt,
but, you know, it's very frustrating for
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was a question in there
which I'll try and respond to,
[SPEAKER_04]: and all I'll do is reflect the fact that,
yes, the National Academy of Science,
[SPEAKER_04]: Engineering, Medicine, conclusive
evidence, I'm fully aware of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can point to five other
meta-analysis systematic reviews that
[SPEAKER_04]: concluded that there is no evidence that
cannabis treats pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So doctors will choose the story that they
think sits their narrative, and this is
[SPEAKER_04]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking at the same studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same body of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: It astonishes me that you can have groups,
and some of them came out of Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are European pain
federations.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've come, Australian groups have come
up with these conclusions that suggest
[SPEAKER_04]: that the evidence is not that strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have this conflicting opinion out
there, and doctors are still polarized.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you, the evidence appears,
you know, quite comprehensive,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not the clinical trial stuff,
and they will always point to the lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: randomized control trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still the currency that they need
to speak, so that's the lack of evidence
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sebastian wants the last word.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say two sentences to both
of you, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Germany, I think it's really important,
also because of what Mark said before,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we give balanced information,
that we are very careful not to seem to
[SPEAKER_05]: advertise, not to exaggerate claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's as a general recommendation to
everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, people are specifically skeptic
about the whole pharma system and pharma
[SPEAKER_05]: companies doing damage, and I think that's
what we stand for, to give out balance,
[SPEAKER_05]: detailed, and to be well-informed,
and that's something that you should
[SPEAKER_05]: always consider doing here in Germany,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: One last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is Elijah from Cannabis Salud
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question for Mr. Schulz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is cannabis so expensive in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said that pharmacists, they have to
add double the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that comes because of the
classification of cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_05]: ingredient, so it goes to the pharmacy,
and the pharmacists have to do an identity
[SPEAKER_05]: test, and so according to their statutes,
they put 100% price upcharge.
[SPEAKER_05]: The new law is supposed to bring that
price down, also.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know how that's gonna happen,
because there's no specific thing that's
[SPEAKER_05]: written in the draft of the new law,
but I think there's a big political will
[SPEAKER_05]: now to get the price down of cannabis in
Germany, because like I said, it's a gram
[SPEAKER_05]: of medical cannabis flowers now cost in
Germany around 22 euros or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, you can call me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He can get it for you like 12 euros.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no, don't call me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just send me a message.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll relay it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again for this wonderful,
fabulous panel.
