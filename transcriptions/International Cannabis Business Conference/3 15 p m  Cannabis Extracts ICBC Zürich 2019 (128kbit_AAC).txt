[SPEAKER_04]: And in general your company is imparting
laboratory devices for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: also for cannabis analogy, also for
police.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with the first question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your company focuses on laboratory
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would the company need to produce GMP
cannabis extracts in Germany or in
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a short version of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, when you go to GMP production,
there is a publicly available list of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It concerns several things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It concerns the equipment, your location,
the raw material that means where you get
[SPEAKER_01]: your stuff from, also the methods that you
use for extraction, and also a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very long list.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to jump very high to meet GMP
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need to think about is basically
three steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing is the input, where you get your
stuff from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the setup of your flowers,
the oils?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know where it was grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a record for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an audit?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you also have to basically document
any kind of equipment that you do with
[SPEAKER_01]: your stuff before it enters your factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second step is basically the
production step.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is isolation and purification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will be treated like any other
pharmaceutical compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to buy equipment that is
validated and is qualified.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to write instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: On everything, starting from the
procedure, how you prepare your
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical compound to the cleaning,
quality control, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the third step that is also very
often forgotten is the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pack your stuff, you have to make
sure, do I get the package from a good
[SPEAKER_01]: provider that has audits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make sure that nothing is going into
my product, like leaching?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then basically when you apply for a GMP
facility, you have to know that there will
[SPEAKER_01]: be audits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on where your stuff is,
if it will be in the US, you will have FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: audits, which will go through all the
steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the European market,
you will have audits according to the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of other companies in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to the small ones and I've been
to the big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge step to go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me please ask you just an additional
question on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Germany, for example, if I compare the
situation to Switzerland, in Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a need for GMP because we have
certified medical cannabis products in the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Switzerland, there are no certified...
There is one, I think it's Satirex.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but this is produced by Bayer or
Almiral, which is... They have their own
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me please... I think it will come
because I think at the end of May,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will have a meeting with the Swiss
medic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an agency in Switzerland that
they will try to get kind of proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rules on how you should produce your stuff
and also how you do the quality control on
[SPEAKER_01]: your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be a meeting at the end of May
or beginning of June where we will talk
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will basically tell us what we
need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can spread this news to our customers
and we can also, for example, make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have basically validated methods
where they do the quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far in Switzerland, cannabis,
CBD cannabis is grown as an agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which companies in Switzerland
specifically do we have the need for the
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP production?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is requesting GMP production in
Switzerland when it comes to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some dealers, I would say the Gold
Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Centers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Centers, which basically will provide
the input material to the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, since the GMP process
starts with the input, they have to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means basically what I'm doing now is
making a validating method where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: check the quality of the input material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my recommendation, if you really
want to go into GMP production,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to partner up with somebody that
knows the staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, somebody that is a
consultant certified with Smith Medic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you find a company that has a GMP
license, making your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have only to take care about
basically your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then find another, for example,
another company that does the packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the quickest way, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: My last question on this topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about extraction products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for which purpose can the product then
be licensed in Switzerland as long as
[SPEAKER_04]: there is no medical law for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's now licensed as a recreational
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the only limit that you have
to test is the THC content, the total THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no limit how much CBD you
should have in your packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the oil and the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you can sell olive oil
without any kind of CBD as long as your
[SPEAKER_01]: THC content is below 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I have now is basically people
measuring the THC content plus
[SPEAKER_01]: additionally nicotine to avoid the
taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Switzerland, if you don't test
for nicotine, you have to pay an extra tax
[SPEAKER_01]: for the tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I'm going to Guido now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guido Wies.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is since 1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guido has been passionate about hemp and
CBD have extraction too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, as a company, he raises them to
the rank of art.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extractor consulting for different
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics expert working with the best
breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of 2016, he created VP Labs
with his partner, Fred Kevin Purser.
[SPEAKER_04]: VP Labs specializes in the research of
distribution on CBD hemp in various ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Guido, you are really as passionate
about extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the basis of any extraction in
Switzerland is hemp with less than 1% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you produce CBD extracts, the THC
concentration may become higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first easier step to go to is to make
that compian and just mix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say before, with oil or with a
solvent, and then you keep it below one.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my company, we make different technique
for keeping that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or first, with the starting material,
we make that kind of process to get some
[SPEAKER_03]: extract below one person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also do it during the extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a CO2 system, for example,
you can only just take out the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, post-extraction, we have
different technique by distillation,
[SPEAKER_03]: by selective distillation, and every time
we go below.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is this one thing what you would
consider as a pillar of extraction?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or of your specific source extraction
you're doing here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I only heard so far that it's
diluted, but I have never heard that the
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD is separated from the THC after the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we make a process, then we can
eliminate the CBD after extraction in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a very complex process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressure, solvent, heat, different kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, we come.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the most important thing in extraction
for us is the security first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Security, then good knowledge of the
material, and then good starting material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I come back to your company later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me introduce Vincent before,
because we're really short on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vincent is, it's on the press time,
we meet on the podium, and he's a
[SPEAKER_04]: co-founder of COO, the curator of
opportunity for SHO companies,
[SPEAKER_04]: a California-based industry-leading
cannabis product group with over 5,000
[SPEAKER_04]: wholesale partners worldwide in active
operations in LA, New York, Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: and South America.
[SPEAKER_04]: In short, you are a real expert in
extraction in marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say brand-building and extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your company focuses on non-solvent
solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Europe people often still think of
American pharma making passion a plastic
[SPEAKER_04]: bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much has that become with your total
technology and approach?
[SPEAKER_04]: You do non-solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we focus on non-solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where SHO came from originally,
solvent as head oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started with rosin extraction
equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea behind solvent extracts
hasn't changed much since the Moroccan
[SPEAKER_05]: bowl beading is still pretty much similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: The three forms of solvent extraction,
or to categorize, further categorize
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent extraction would be dry sift,
rosin, and ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: So dry sift, or mechanical separation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rosin, which is using heat and pressure,
or ice water hash, which is using cold
[SPEAKER_05]: water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all different ways to use
non-solvents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although some people can say water is a
solvent, but I like to consider it a
[SPEAKER_05]: vessel rather than a solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes the tritones and moves them away
from the plant material like a vessel
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than like a solvent extractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we hear from you is the techniques
are very far back in California because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a legal market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can work openly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say in general, the market in
California is very far back when it comes
[SPEAKER_04]: to phytorextraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, we have German and
Swiss companies when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction from hop and other plants which
are not cannabis, where Europe is a world
[SPEAKER_04]: leader.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say, what could those two
industries learn from each other?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they are basically doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a full spectrum extraction of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are two totally different
industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: What could they learn from each other?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would they connect?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think right now the US is leaps and
bounds ahead of anywhere as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis concentrates are concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that's going to stay the
case.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as the world becomes educated and
opens their eyes to the benefits and to
[SPEAKER_05]: how popular concentrates are on the
market, just to touch on that for a
[SPEAKER_05]: second, if you look at the trends in the
concentrate market, right now in the US,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're exponentially increasing every
month, a lot of times go up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the concentrate market continues to
increase in every state.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take out some reports based on BS
analytics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They shoot some data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So touching back to how the Swiss and the
Germans are leaders in extracts and other
[SPEAKER_05]: things, I think as the Swiss, Germans,
Europe starts to play with cannabis more,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to continue to be experts in
extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just haven't had the time to play yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been playing a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to Janna.
[SPEAKER_04]: Janna, my next question to you is here in
the analysis business, mostly your
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment is used for analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In which way can your company support the
standardization of cannabis extraction and
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis of cannabis extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I see or my customers doing or
what I'm saying is when you're in process
[SPEAKER_01]: controls, it means you're starting to
develop an extraction protocol and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically playing around with pressure,
heat, and time, and you're trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: the best ways, maybe also from additive to
additional solvents, and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find the best way to get your compounds,
maybe it's GHC or it's CDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be better for me as a chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give me a plant and you tell me
this is my target molecule, I can extract
[SPEAKER_01]: it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just in process controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing is basically,
anyway, if you go to a business,
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP or not GMP, and you want to have the
same quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask additionally, because the
cannabis industry, cannabis laboratories
[SPEAKER_04]: are kind of a very new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's such a new thing,
because I mean, I've extracted very
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants like hops, like sage or
something like this, or like thyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for different companies,
for example, Phrygans, food and fragrance
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, and the chemical process is the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I actually wanted to ask is,
is there any specific need for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis, for cannabis extraction,
you don't get you don't have one with
[SPEAKER_04]: other plants, do you get feedback from
scientists that say, okay, I need this or
[SPEAKER_04]: this special developed equipment for them
to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think what you have to think about
is, I mean, if you go for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: do an extraction on hops, do an extraction
on sage, you know, it's usually grown
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in Europe, legally by a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to a cannabis market,
if you grow cannabis legally in
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland, you can be sure that you
should not have any kind of toxic metals
[SPEAKER_01]: inside your input.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't know where your stuff
comes from, and you get it from the dump
[SPEAKER_01]: site somewhere in Italy, or Sicily,
I mean, you cannot be sure that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: some toxic metals inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen one case of a patient in the
burn hospital was poisoned by marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had a leak poisoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something toxic with the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died of leak poisoning, yeah,
because he got some stuff somewhere he
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was toxic because of the metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't control your input,
you get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, controlling input is my next is my
key word for for Vito.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about cannabis THC,
CBD all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about terpenes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you also extract terpenes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you standardize terpenes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any demand on flavor hunting?
[SPEAKER_03]: On the moment, we're just not focused on
terpenes because it's actually difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: to work with some CBD strains below 1%.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get good fragrance, but not the real
fragrance of some real THC strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in America, there is a lot of perfect
terpenes already, because they get a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of good starting material to do with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make terpenes by distillation from the
extract in our company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we make a good terpene, but it's
exclusively from CBD plants, and we mix
[SPEAKER_03]: different kind of plants to make a...
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a demand on the market also
for this terpene extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, we're stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we have not been dealing about
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's go to Wins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a whole set in California or a
whole set in the States about terpenes?
[SPEAKER_05]: We almost don't control them, concentrate
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if I want to concentrate,
I say, let me get some terps.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, terps, terpenes have become one of the
hottest keywords there is in Canada,
[SPEAKER_05]: in California right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor, the aroma, and the feelings
that the terp profile contributes is huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, up here right now, we're talking a lot
about CBD isolate, distillate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are concentrates for short,
but that's not a concentrate when I find a
concentrate in the market of selling
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: A concentrate in the market of California,
when someone wants to concentrate on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market, is a jar of rosin, or shatter,
or crumble, or a VHL of some fashion,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it has a terp profile considered with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor and aroma and the effect that
you get from the whole sensation is what
[SPEAKER_05]: that concentrate is known for.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD isolate and distillate has its place,
and I see more of a place as it moves
[SPEAKER_05]: towards medical, or as supplements,
or for food.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great as ingredients, but for the
sewer market, it kind of disconcentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about isolating.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the entourage of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about all the cannabinoids,
not just CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a hundred other ones that we don't
talk about at all right now, and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: about how those cannabinoids interact with
each other, along with the terp profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the true magic of this plant,
is how all of that combines each other,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's why none of us fully understand
it yet, because it's all those different
[SPEAKER_05]: parts playing together at once that give
us these feelings of why we love this
[SPEAKER_05]: plant the way we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, people from other industries think
that we're going to come in and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to do the same thing we do with
Sage, and we're going to extract one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing, but the thing is we're extracting
one thing and we're forgetting about the
[SPEAKER_05]: 99 other things that play into the fact
that we need to consider right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me ask again, because I think this
is a very important topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a difference between isolating
and extraction, which a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially who are not so much into this
topic, do not recognize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, isolation is a type of extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extraction means you're condensing the
cannabinoids into a more concentrated
[SPEAKER_05]: form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Goal means concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting rid of everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cannabinoids and the terpenes,
that's a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're isolating things, you're
distilling things, we're further
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrating, or now we're isolating into
your CBD, your THC, your CBN, anything
[SPEAKER_05]: else you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your terpenes, your individual terpenes,
your terpene blends.
[SPEAKER_05]: However you want to break this plant down,
you can then do it, because yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: we know how to separate things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always further separate things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we get too far ahead of
separating it completely, and before we
[SPEAKER_05]: understand, before we're separating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then please let me come to the next
question, because I think the California
[SPEAKER_04]: market is, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market is very far advanced, and if the
preconditions are equal, how does the
[SPEAKER_04]: demand for extracts from that Ohio
cannabis in general develop?
[SPEAKER_04]: If all products are legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in Switzerland we have the situation
of all cannabis products are legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if given the case all are legal,
how does this ratio develop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I think I touched on that a little
bit with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Analytics.
[SPEAKER_05]: The concentrate market is surpassing the
flower market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flowers don't work traditionally,
but as we open people's eyes to more
[SPEAKER_05]: products and other ways to consume,
I mean, I change people's thoughts all day
[SPEAKER_05]: on smoking concentrates, where a lot of
people are very hesitant on smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates, and that's why we've done it
to solid ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can take a nug in front of you,
and squish it, and squeeze it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's basically like juicing it,
and now I have a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing, no magic involved in that
or anything, I didn't do any chemical
[SPEAKER_05]: process to it or anything, I have a
concentrate in front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I let you smoke that concentrate,
and if you were traditionally smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: flower before that time, show you the
proper way to smoke that concentrate,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna continue to smoke
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My next question goes out to you and
Triana as well, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Switzerland we have, we have a little
bit legal problems with extraction,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is not, you cannot act as you really
want to because you have to stick to
[SPEAKER_04]: certain limits, but in general,
if the legal frame would be given,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think Switzerland is ready to
produce full-spectrum cannabis extract on
[SPEAKER_04]: a pharmaceutical level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are your companies ready for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, pretty sure we are ready for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the next step now, we need to go
a little bit further, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your company also invested in
Switzerland, so do you think Switzerland
[SPEAKER_04]: is ready for full-spectrum extract on
pharmaceutical level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we are very, very short on time
today, I think I just have one other
[SPEAKER_04]: minute, I would really like to ask the
panelists another five or six questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is the first panel we have today,
and we only have another 12 minutes for
[SPEAKER_04]: questions from the audience, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time, first of all, for the
panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to ask a question first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, I've been to some trade shows,
I've talked to some people, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think about a lot of these artificial
terpene companies, where they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, we can just sell you the terpenes from
OG Kush, but they're not extracted?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: My feeling on terpenes, an isolated
terpene is an isolated terpene,
[SPEAKER_05]: the problem is when you're buying OG Kush,
it's someone formulating what they say OG
[SPEAKER_05]: Kush is.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's not fake mercy, and it's a fake
combination of the terpenes to create what
[SPEAKER_05]: is now OG Kush, but there's something fake
about those terpenes at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day, so if you're looking for cannabis
blends, then cannabis effects,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you wanna get the true cannabis
effects in blends, sure, you can do
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis-derived terpenes, but if you're
only looking for flavoring, there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: difference between limonene from a lemon
or limonene from a cannabis blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do they have the same effects,
though, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-style effects, right,
so people say, you know, Bersin enhances
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC, or limonene has these other
qualities, like the terpenes give you
[SPEAKER_02]: different, more than just THC,
they give you a different effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, but do these artificial terpenes work
the same way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're not artificial, they're
derived from other, I should say
[SPEAKER_05]: non-cannabis terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Non-cannabis-derived, so artificial,
if you're talking about something
[SPEAKER_05]: artificial, I don't know what we're
talking about, but we're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: non-cannabis-leaver glands or what not,
I don't know what they're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just he's saying that they're
synthetically derived, therefore their
[SPEAKER_00]: isomer may be different, or their
enantiomer configurations, we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about mirror molecules, and essentially
you can create, maybe recreate a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of synthetically reconstituted
terpenes, but they wouldn't necessarily be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same ones that you would extract from
the original raw material source.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question is actually for Janna,
and I'll try to make it quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you mentioned that a patient at the
Byrne Hospital died from lead poisoning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that also the only real requirements
in Switzerland right now are to test for
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD or THC content, meaning the below 1%,
and CBD sometimes, I guess, the test for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of your customers or clients
actually try to test for heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: They test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I also have a lot of customers in
the police force, so if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: address it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have a lot of customers in
hospitals, but usually what I always do,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you know your source, if you grow your
stuff in your backyard again, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: need to test for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would really always recommend you
to test is if you have organic hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that means you don't use any kind of
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test for micro-toxins, because this is the
second most toxic substance that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody thinks that bio is
healthy, and organic is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if you don't store your stuff
properly, that means keep it dry in a dark
[SPEAKER_01]: place, you will have mold, and this mold
is very, very toxic in small quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing I would always test,
and the second thing is if you really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know where your stuff comes from,
heavy metals, because it kills you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen any kind of death patient
because of a cannabis overdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never seen it in my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen overdoses, but not on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any more questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it one more time for our panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
