[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the media and marketing panel
here on the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is going to be one of the
very few Beelingo channels because I can
[SPEAKER_06]: introduce three journalists, two from
Germany and one journalist from the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I decided because it's about German
language, it's a language panel,
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I decided to hold it in two
languages.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as Anthony said, please get your
headsets in.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need translation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm proud to present first,
next to me is Ophelia Chong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ophelia is a founder of Stockpot Images
and founder of Asian Americans for
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Educations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And before anybody asks, she's not related
to Tommy Chong.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's independent.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's driven to help shape the new
conversation of cannabis and is guided by
[SPEAKER_06]: one mission to advocate for the
legalization of cannabis and offer
[SPEAKER_06]: truthful reflections of the faces and
communities that embrace cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's start with the first question,
Ophelia, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is being marketed to the
mainstream without segmentation,
[SPEAKER_06]: which ignores the diversity of the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you suggest cannabis companies
evolve their marketing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the States, we are a little
further ahead on education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of media outlets that talk
about what CBD is and what THC is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the history of cannabis started
in California with Proposition 215 in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1996, where we were allowed to have
medical marijuana, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they call it, medical
marijuana for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was started by the LGBTQ community,
Dennis Perrone and others to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine to people with cancer and AIDS,
because they were tired of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested in a park buying medicine for
their partners, for their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Brownie Mary was there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was basically a mother of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: She made brownies for her patients,
her cancer and AIDS patients, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: could only eat small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she made extremely potent brownies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Brownie Mary is the mother of
edibles, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all arrested, and they
brought cannabis to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had it since 1996, legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best growers are in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how to market it is we went from the
underground to above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we had to educate everybody
else on what CBD is, what THC is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get a lot of, well, if I take
CBD, will it make me high?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, it won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a different feeling for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different cannabinoid that's going
to go into your body for what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC should be along with our
entourage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really educating a lot of people
to learn what CBD is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in the States, we have CBD hemp,
which can go across state lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you say it's the new aloe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, a new aloe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is people don't understand,
still don't understand what CBD is,
[SPEAKER_01]: because right now we're putting CBD in
toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go into face wipes,
shampoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is you see it in a big
bottle of aloe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ask you, what is the aloe going to
do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say, well, I think it's going to
make me better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make this better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you know why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And most consumers won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put CBD on a bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: A consumer will not know why that CBD is
good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it going to do for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, do you want to put stuff in
your body that you think is going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to be educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what Europe needs to have now,
is the same education that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are companies that are coming
here that are going to bring CBD for your
[SPEAKER_01]: pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like say, vet CBD here is sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Xu, he'll be speaking this afternoon
about why CBD is great for your pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have all this education,
which you need to bring here to bring to
[SPEAKER_01]: the mass market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't educate them,
then it just becomes aloe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just becomes lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no meaning to it, other than just
what someone tells you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm going to switch to German.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next to Ophelia is Moritz.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the founder of Kraut Invest.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first B2B magazine for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to be a journalist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Since yesterday, he's the PR and marketing
manager at Farmaco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or for the PR and marketing department at
Farmaco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Farmaco is a company that will have 50
tons of cannabis next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to import medical cannabis
to Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've just started a new life,
Moritz.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to ask you, what do you need to
change in our media so that cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: becomes mainstream?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had two very exciting news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already involved in the
communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the 50-ton import contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, secondly, also the patent
application for the biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: production of over 180 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the communication for that was very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can only appeal that all those who
are responsible for corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: communication in the field of cannabis
really consider two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've always noticed that in the
individual journalist talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the interest of the journalist and
ultimately the reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about bags or suitcases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really about the health of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We held this impressive lecture again
yesterday morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just have to understand when
journalists ask critical questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a serious company, we have to
welcome that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have in other topics,
now keyword blockchain, where there are
[SPEAKER_02]: also very good models, of which some are
here, seen what happens if the hype is
[SPEAKER_02]: built up too quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we should make sure that we look
for an open dialogue in the communication,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the journalist talk, a transparent
dialogue, which is really based on facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always that easy to get to the
facts and data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have institutions like the
Handverband and Provision Partners,
[SPEAKER_02]: who also do a good job there and give us
materials in the communication that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: use and that are also founded and that are
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have always received critical questions
again and the exchange was then very good
[SPEAKER_02]: on an internal level.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have written for the Taz before.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Taz is not necessarily known as
cannabis-enemy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as a journalist, as a free journalist,
how do you encounter the topic of the
[SPEAKER_06]: larger media, of the over-regional media
and also of the smaller local newspapers
[SPEAKER_06]: that are read by many households?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any prejudices?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the time is a while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two years ago we experienced a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the ICBC was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will probably see in the future what
kind of role the ICBC played.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had until two years ago only good or
bad, black or white, legal or illegal,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we are now seeing is that we have
an internal discourse in the public about
[SPEAKER_02]: the market, about health, about the
economy and about finance, also about
[SPEAKER_02]: science and research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should also intensify this dialogue
and discourse.
[SPEAKER_02]: What actually happened in these two years
is impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in the background, now that we
see what is happening with Twitter and Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: on the quick side, that there has actually
been a lot of change in the election in
[SPEAKER_02]: the public through an internal exchange.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how I perceived it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next question goes to Tim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim Geyer from Weißmagazin is Senior
Editor at Weißmagazin Deutschland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Previously he wrote for Playbill and
Focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tim writes about right-wing
extremists, about gender politics and,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, about contemporary politics and
about cannabis as medicine and as a
[SPEAKER_06]: free-time drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have published quite a few articles in
the last two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my question is, before you have dealt
with the topic more intensively in the
[SPEAKER_06]: last two years, journalistically,
has anything changed in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened to you in the last two
years?
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anything happened to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, something has definitely changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say two years ago, or maybe you
have to go back even further.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you have to go back to 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: There I was for the first time for the
Focus in Colorado to portray the growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before that, there were actually three
players for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were the consumers, there were the
police and state prosecutors and there was
[SPEAKER_03]: the illegal sector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, I have of course spoken to a
lot of people throughout the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, above all, the activists came to
it and, most importantly, the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, above all, since the legalization of
medical cannabis in Germany in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then something has changed in that
sense that the topic is no longer treated
[SPEAKER_03]: abstractly, but rather about the personal
stories of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that is the crux of the
matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you look at it from a
business point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, as was said here, want to bring
cannabis into the mainstream, then it
[SPEAKER_03]: works especially in the press,
in the media, about personal stories of
[SPEAKER_03]: people whose cannabis is not only used as
a free-time drug, but above all as
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I can give you an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the last year, we visited an
80-year-old lady who had been taking pain
[SPEAKER_03]: medication for 60 years, had chronic pain,
who was sometimes prescribed opioids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't help at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually only had side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you are with this 80-year-old
lady in East Berlin and bake cookies with
[SPEAKER_03]: her who simply explains to you very
rationally and soberly how it helps her,
[SPEAKER_03]: completely unideologically, then these are
the stories that can change something and
[SPEAKER_03]: that also convince people who are very
cannabis-intensive, I would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just had to follow up on this
story.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also know this older lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: She is the grandmother of my cameraman.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am also very grateful to
Weißmagazin, because three or four years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago, we had already presented it in
cannabis-specific publications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, no one noticed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Weißmagazin was with the lady,
RTL was there, BZ was there, and you can
[SPEAKER_06]: see how that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I also noticed when she recently
came to RTL, the interview with this old
[SPEAKER_06]: lady, the cut was very strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was laughing all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the representation, if you have to
agree with me, is not the same everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the report from RTL and Weißmagazin
basically had the same food, namely a
[SPEAKER_06]: visit to the old lady at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: The representation was very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in many media, as my
observation, there is still the almost
[SPEAKER_03]: caricature-like image of
cannabis-consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I can't quite explain
where this comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably the belief that you have to
meet a certain expectation of how people
[SPEAKER_03]: who consume cannabis have to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may add something to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In advance, I also looked at how the big
ones report about regional newspapers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a conservative newspaper like the FAZ
writes about the boom when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: market reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: Handelsblatt has an internal analysis of
the market, also of millions of sales and
[SPEAKER_02]: billions of business insiders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also an economic newspaper or an online
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has done a complete analysis on
prohibition and legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can also see that in the big media,
which used to report quite critically and
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly schematically, internal
discourses take place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ophelia, my next question to you is
because we are talking about media
[SPEAKER_06]: strategies on cannabis here in German
media.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my question to you is you are a bit
further advanced in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have stockpot images.
[SPEAKER_06]: You make stockpot images of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Images, very high class images of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the general strategy to educate
people in California or in the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the general strategy to educate
them in the media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have someone tell you that looks like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to sell to a senior woman,
have Betty White talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to talk to whatever segment
you use, you find somebody that looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what we do in stock
photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a very diverse collection of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: LGBTQ, black, white, brown, yellow,
young, old, children, pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I want to do is give an image
that anyone can license that looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: the market they're going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this slide, this talking about the
market in the states, wait until it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the flavors are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for marketing to segments,
there are segments that people ignore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's flavors in every community that
want a certain thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you want mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the bastardization of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are adding mint, bubble gum,
flavor, strawberry flavors to attract a
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd that doesn't like the taste of weed,
but want a flavor, but they want the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a joke, this slide I made is future
vape pens of the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have so many weird flavors,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next one is coming up like Cheetos or
hot dog water, pumpkin spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we do pumpkin spice in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not a pumpkin spice vape pen coming
soon?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're marketing to everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems as education does not only work
by words.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to touch all senses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different communities, different
ethnicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't like sweets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't like sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't like savory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to then bring the market down
into even finer segments to sell to each
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not vanilla for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 32 flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to satisfy each market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then with each market, you have to
have the person to represent that market
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to cannabis in Germany,
to education, we are very focused on
[SPEAKER_06]: words.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you agree if I say we should focus
more on pictures, on stories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictures are powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you the victory kiss with the
sailor and the nurse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already in your head, you already know
what the image looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you a picture of the,
I can say napalm girl, the girl running
[SPEAKER_01]: naked from the napalm attack in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That image almost stopped the war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those images don't need words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand what the image looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photography, imagery is not bound by
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: So images can actually change someone's
opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what in Germany, we don't have that
kind of high level on professional
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis photography as you offer in the
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have magic mushrooms now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's next.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then my next question goes out to Warren.
[SPEAKER_06]: I switched to German again, Moritz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ophelia just told us that over there in
cannabis marketing, you are much further
[SPEAKER_06]: than we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pictures play a much bigger role.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our preparation mail, I have the
question, do I really want to ask?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have compared that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are currently in cannabis marketing,
in the perception of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_06]: media, where the gay movement was in the
80s.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means it is politically correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that it will be allowed at some
point, but it is not completely allowed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you report about it, you always
have to mention the other side briefly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you do that for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not the visual type.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have always worked on the internal
exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I just said it, it is
impressive what is happening here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany after two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how far we are already in expert
groups to talk about the concrete causes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If pictures can help, it will be even more
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes it is not easier to make
a good picture than to find many
[SPEAKER_02]: arguments.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, because the Weiss magazine has not
yet positioned itself clearly,
[SPEAKER_06]: but with the Weiss magazine it is also the
case that the editors should write their
[SPEAKER_06]: opinions and make good excuses.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are not talking about objective
journalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: The opinion is being justified.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your magazine has a lot of good
articles, a lot of informative articles
[SPEAKER_06]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The NZZ, the newspaper, even the entire
editorial board has a reaction to the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that cannabis legalization is socially
useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And otherwise it is a bit in the German
media landscape.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nobody positions themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is the reason?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one reason is simply time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again the example of Denver, Colorado,
when I was there in 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very surprised when I learned that
the Denver Post had already founded The
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis in 2013 and had set up a
marijuana editor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really impressive for me back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course you have to know that
the media landscape there had 12-13 years
[SPEAKER_03]: of time, from the introduction of medical
cannabis to recreational, to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Germany it has been exactly two
years since medical cannabis has been
legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I know it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to be a little patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just notice that there is still a lot of
ignorance in many editorial boards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I notice that especially with the topic of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are articles that are partially
hazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are articles about it, whether it is
legal or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We published a text about it some time
ago, because we noticed that there is
[SPEAKER_03]: simply an incredibly great need to clarify
this question, even if it is of course
[SPEAKER_03]: still hovering in the German legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, what Ophelia has already said
before, you just have to explain it to
[SPEAKER_03]: people a little more, teach them a lot
more, make the discussion much more
[SPEAKER_03]: rational.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said earlier, I try to speak as
rationally as possible about this topic of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if that happens in German
media, then it can be like a wave effect
[SPEAKER_03]: that then spreads to larger media houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We as Weiß have of course because we are
internationally established, because we
[SPEAKER_03]: are a Canadian-American media company,
where there are of course already much
[SPEAKER_03]: greater experiences with the topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a certain lead there, I have to
say.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next question goes to Moritz.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have now talked about the role of
journalists in the media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the cannabis industry also has
an interest in the media industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The news you have probably all seen,
I hope so, otherwise we would not have
[SPEAKER_02]: done a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will now import 50 tons of
pharmaceutical cannabis in the next four
[SPEAKER_02]: years and at the same time in the
laboratory at the patent application
[SPEAKER_02]: research for the production of over 180
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a clear research company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course you wanted to sell your
product in the end, but as a
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceutical company you are not allowed
to advertise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevertheless, it is important that your
product is known, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I strongly believe that we can deepen
the discussion in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: sector and then also the knowledge that is
on the media side, the knowledge that is
[SPEAKER_02]: on the media side, so that we can then put
it in dialogue and then also be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: deliver the appropriate facts that
journalists still want to know or where
[SPEAKER_02]: there is still a need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we don't have so much time left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we give the audience five minutes
to ask us two or three questions,
[SPEAKER_06]: my last question goes out to Ophelia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ophelia, we heard a lot about media
strategy within the last 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you say if it comes to cannabis
specifically?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there specific publications?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: further advanced?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they hit the mainstream more?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably you only know British
publications, but is there a difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between the cannabis publications?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of cannabis publications,
but they go to the same market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already the people who are converted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, but then you have Newsweek,
Time, Centennial Publications,
[SPEAKER_01]: AMG, they're all putting out special
edition cannabis magazines now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quarterly to reach the new market that the
magazines are being sold in drug stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: bookstores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last three years, it's been moving
into mainstream media, but it just has
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just haven't found that spot yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the first Sanjay Gupta on CNN?
[SPEAKER_01]: That will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, we're still waiting
for that final push.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that would be an inspiration for me,
if other media representatives heard about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A weekend edition about cannabis would be
great for DITADS or other liberal
[SPEAKER_06]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a great enrichment.
[SPEAKER_06]: That together with the cannabis industry,
together with the cannabis experts,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can publish a weekend edition like the
Zeitmagazin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can start a project in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank all three of you for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we close, we only have three
minutes left for questions from the
[SPEAKER_06]: audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony, there's somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a panel where we're talking a lot
about marketing and we've also been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about CBD, we're generally
talking about low THC cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: there is the rest of the cannabinoid
profile that's important to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, why do you think CBD is
still the term that we use in marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: when it is technically incorrect?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a CBD marketing expert,
but I think this is also due to the lack
[SPEAKER_06]: of information the industry here in
Germany has at the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody should have created a new
strategy or a new wording.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's because CBD is the new
buzzword.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD is in everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD toothpaste, CBD lotion, CBD mouthwash.
[SPEAKER_05]: People who have tried CBD, people who
extol the virtues of CBD, it's become the
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one wants to buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one knows what CBG is or CBN.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's like, oh, I need to sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a high CBN joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just think CBD will make me feel
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on us to educate more people about
all the cannabinoids and different terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles and all those different effects,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody makes a pet rock and then all of
a sudden everybody else has another pet
[SPEAKER_05]: rock or some sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: People always want to jump on the hot
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD shoe leather or CBD fruit shoes or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's less letters to print.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a short statement on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Luke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an independent filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I specialize on hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really important not to
forget that we're not only talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: the medical aspect of this wonderful
plant, but there's so much more this plant
[SPEAKER_07]: can do for individuals as well as this
planet as a collective.
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper, fuel and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's not forget.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, asking you guys, working in media,
how can we spread the holistic word about
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis and what are you guys doing for
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, stick to journalistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my main concern.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to glorify it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stick to journalistic rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we reach the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we start glorifying it, we will always
be considered as a kind of sect.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a way, I do think stick to the
journalistic rules and the rest will
[SPEAKER_06]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's important that you show
every aspect of cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is absolutely one aspect that we
should probably emphasize more.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that would be not on the less
important side, but I think if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using medical cannabis as a door opener,
then there will be space to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: other topics like this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Müller.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a youth judge and a criminal judge in
the Bundesrepublik Deutschland.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been involved in legalization for
about 40 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for the podium.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to do business here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't it belong to the business to
support people who use cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs for legalization?
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it necessary that the people who
think in five to ten years have a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: market, this market, to support the street
movement, the demonstrations and the
[SPEAKER_04]: associations that are already using it for
legalization, as if it were the German
[SPEAKER_04]: Ham-Verband and Lieb, an association of
criminals, judges, state attorneys and
[SPEAKER_04]: police officers for legalization?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have all been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Andreas, I don't think you need an answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, he's a judge.
[SPEAKER_06]: He can do anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever you want.
