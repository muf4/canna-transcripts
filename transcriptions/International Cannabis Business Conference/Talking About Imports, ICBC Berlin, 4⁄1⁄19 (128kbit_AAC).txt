[SPEAKER_06]: On my left side you see Adam Seitz from
Pharmacy Lux 990, which is a pharmacy
[SPEAKER_06]: which is concentrating very much on
cannabis medicine, cannabis patients,
[SPEAKER_06]: a good source of information for us every
time it's about pharmacy issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have got David Hinn from Kana
Medical, claiming to be the biggest
[SPEAKER_06]: importer in Germany for medical flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: He can tell you more about that later.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have Charlie Erkelenz from Bedokan,
which was for me just a few years ago Mr.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Europe or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That few time ago we had only Bedokan in
our pharmacies, nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is nice for me to have him here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just give a very little short
introduction what we are talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: here when it's about imports.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that is not the same as talking
about the German market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You hear more about that later.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have the German market you have
several different products and a big
[SPEAKER_06]: proportion of this market is not flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Dronabinol, pure THC product,
maybe about one third of the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no real clear numbers and
statistics there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is kind of Monopoly, a German
company doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have a big proportion of
Sativex, also kind of Monopoly from Great
[SPEAKER_06]: Britain, you know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we are talking about the rest of
the market, mainly flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: My bet is about 40%, maybe a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a growing number, but small,
but growing extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we are talking about here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of quite a free market with
many producers, many importers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, so that's fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the playground for everybody here
more or less.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's start with that on the front,
on the count of the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_06]: giving Adam the question, what kind of
products do you have there in the
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what about the proportion you sell
there in your pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just following up on your first
thoughts about Dronabinol and the
[SPEAKER_07]: synthetic THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to differentiate those from
the flows.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the number you just mentioned,
60% of the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's a narcotic drug that has been
prescribed since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those numbers are accurate since it's
a simple drug and it's easy to understand
[SPEAKER_07]: for physicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why they prefer to prescribe
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the public insurance cover the
costs, only cover the cost of having a
[SPEAKER_07]: medical cannabis therapy if there was also
a therapy with Dronabinol that has been
[SPEAKER_07]: failed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is why those numbers are that
high.
[SPEAKER_07]: In our pharmacy, we are specialized in
medical cannabis and in the flows,
[SPEAKER_07]: we sell about five to seven strains from
the Netherlands and around 25 strains are
[SPEAKER_07]: being imported from Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can confirm that number.
[SPEAKER_07]: We provided extracts, very less than 60%
to our patients in the last year,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's definitely interesting what the
extracts are holding us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is also mentioned already in the
prescription of this panel is the problem
[SPEAKER_06]: of bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is available?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is not available in your pharmacy and
everywhere else in Germany?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so the bottlenecks are huge,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the pharmacy, it's quite challenging
actually to provide all sort of medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis that are available in Germany for
the patient because there is no source.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no source where we could get the
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which strains are available right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a pharmacy, you have to go and ask
what you can deliver.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the bottlenecks also mean that if you
are not well prepared, if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: huge amount of cannabis on stock,
that you're most probably not able to
[SPEAKER_07]: provide the medication to the patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you mostly have to say no to your
patients and the patients in need to find
[SPEAKER_07]: a pharmacy because as you know,
the prescription for narcotic drugs is
[SPEAKER_07]: only available, you have only seven days
just to redeem that prescription.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the patients are definitely,
patients have definitely a huge problem
[SPEAKER_07]: with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we are trying to solve is to
provide the information what exact strains
[SPEAKER_07]: are available right now on the German
market in order for the patients and for
[SPEAKER_07]: the doctor to know where to go with the
prescription and what to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, just one more thought to
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: From the pharmacy perspective,
it's very important to provide a patient
[SPEAKER_07]: the medicament just to follow up on the
medication.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can provide the same medication
once it has been used up, then you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: following on the exact path.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is quite huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once the strain is prescribed and in
two weeks it's out of stock, then either
[SPEAKER_07]: the doctor or the patients, but mostly the
doctor, has to look for another solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of strain that sometimes it has a
different effect, mostly, but sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is slowing down the
development.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are talking about three tons of flowers
last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: What my bet is 50 to 60,000 patients used
last year, could have been much more if we
[SPEAKER_06]: had good supply.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: We Germans are not able to grow our own,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least we need lots of time to get it on
the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are begging the world, give us your
butts, and we don't get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially we see those bottlenecks and
problems from Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my next question to David, what's going
on?
[SPEAKER_06]: You had also problems importing from
Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the problem?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does it not come?
[SPEAKER_06]: And is this problem going to solve in the
next future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Georg, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one more thing to add.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said we're the biggest independent
importer in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is a little detail,
but significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening in Canada,
we mainly see two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really, really big facilities that
are going to produce lots of quantities
[SPEAKER_02]: that is earmarked and reserved for Germany
for the simple fact that they can generate
[SPEAKER_02]: a higher yield when they sell it to Europe
other than in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not forget that Canada has just
opened up in October the recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second impact is let's not forget
most of these companies that are supplying
[SPEAKER_02]: metal cannabis are public companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they did is they entered in lots
of bankable agreements with the provinces
[SPEAKER_02]: to supply those provinces, and lots of
them were over-promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time they were executing this
contract, and they were fully aware of
[SPEAKER_02]: this, but they were literally pokering to
have new facilities up and running online,
[SPEAKER_02]: being fully certified, obtaining a
cultivation or sales license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in time, that simply did not happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were one of the importers that
actually got hit by this with a full
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, because last year when I was here
I was telling lots about a new supplier
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have helped obtaining the EUGMP
status.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did this, we kept our word,
but what happened was the next thing is we
[SPEAKER_02]: got into some political conflict with the
supplier, so we were no longer able to
[SPEAKER_02]: import from this producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given the German narcotic regulations and
pharmaceutical regulation, obtaining,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a new supplier EUGMP ready takes
us roughly 150 to 180 days, so there's
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of things coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, we're actually just waiting
for an export permit from Health Canada to
[SPEAKER_02]: have new kind of medical varieties on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's let's say three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are fully packaged, they are laying
in stock in Canada, but at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, at the end of the day there is still
lots of problems going on in Canada with
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to close this gap for a
constant supply, but I'm very hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: for actually Q3, Q4 that those gap will
get much, much better due to the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of these Giga facilities are coming
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in Canada last week,
so Monday to Wednesday, and I've seen a
[SPEAKER_02]: few facilities, and I'm truly confident
and hopeful that those Giga facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: that can actually produce 50 to 60,000
kilograms a year will have a very positive
[SPEAKER_02]: impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is a second side,
this is also affecting Telling's company,
[SPEAKER_02]: is we would love to import more from the
Netherlands, but the way the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_02]: is selling due to the UMC is really making
us a tough life.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the simple fact that we have a fixed
amount that is going to Germany on a
[SPEAKER_02]: monthly basis, this amount is divided by
the amount of growing importers equally,
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly equally, and technically
Cannabidical itself has about 200 to 300
[SPEAKER_02]: kilos on pre-orders a month that we cannot
serve at the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that leads to the question
which other countries could provide our
[SPEAKER_06]: needs here, and also leads to Telling,
and that maybe in the first thought,
[SPEAKER_06]: unusual idea of the Netherlands government
giving a limit to the exports.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a funny story going on,
maybe you can tell us if that is right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The limit you could provide to Germany was
much lower until I think summer 2018,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then our health ministry, Minister
Jens Spahn was phone calling panically,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Netherlands government, give us more,
lift the limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that story right, and how is the story
going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Georg.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the story is right,
that in the first place, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there have been requests on
the political level, that's where the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing is basically playing,
that's the playing field in Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's on the political and regulatory level
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dealing with regulatory organizations,
dealing with governments, dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled substances does mean,
in Europe especially, that it's a fully
[SPEAKER_03]: locked-in market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been operating in this market
since 2003, the first 10 years not so much
[SPEAKER_03]: happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: From 2008, we started exporting very
little amounts to Germany, Italy,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few other European countries,
and that's where it all started,
[SPEAKER_03]: and where the OMC, the Dutch regulatory
office that is responsible for keeping the
[SPEAKER_03]: monopoly on the trade in cannabis,
I have to emphasize that because the trade
[SPEAKER_03]: in Europe will not be in the hands of
individual companies if you talk in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis flower, it will be in the hands
of the regulatory organizations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: appointed by their government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Germany we have B-Farm, in Holland
we have the OMC doing that, and at some
[SPEAKER_03]: point, I think it was about eight or nine
years ago, the Dutch government was kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of swamped with requests from all over the
world, including Israel, they were asking
[SPEAKER_03]: metric tons of products, and basically we
were the only company at that time,
[SPEAKER_03]: and in that time we were producing only
maybe 200 kilos a year, so those requests
[SPEAKER_03]: could not be fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Dutch government had in the back
of their mind, obviously, they don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to disadvantage anybody who was coming to
ask for product, so they start dividing
[SPEAKER_03]: product in portions, say you can get a
little bit of this and you can get a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of depending on our
ability to expand, and also the change we
[SPEAKER_03]: saw in the world over the last four or
five years, that actually also changed
[SPEAKER_03]: this whole situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able at some point,
and it started back in 2013, I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: were able to expand, we expanded up until
now three times, we came from a level of
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 kilos annually where we were in 2012,
we are now at 5,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: 5,000 kilos annual and we will grow
quickly now this year, doubling almost
[SPEAKER_03]: those numbers, go to nine metric tons a
year, and we have plans beyond that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but again, we are trying to keep up,
but demand, and that's another thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: the demand is not just coming up right
now, the demand has there been for decades
[SPEAKER_03]: already basically, however, and as I said
in the beginning, regulatory and political
[SPEAKER_03]: hurdles and thresholds, kept patients away
from a legal system, so we had this huge
[SPEAKER_03]: illicit system, and we still see it in the
Netherlands with the coffee shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: where the product being sold through the
pharmacy is insignificant to what is being
[SPEAKER_03]: sold in coffee shops, but that's illegal
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also do see a lot of patients
appear in that coffee shop still,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a situation you don't have in
Germany, so now the market is opening up
[SPEAKER_03]: in Germany, you see patients flooding into
the system, of course the reimbursement
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is there, that's another important
thing and an important feature that the
[SPEAKER_03]: German situation now supplies to patients,
and that's very good, we had reimbursement
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Netherlands, it has been taken away
again due to lack of scientific evidence,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's always the same thing, although we
know that there is a lot of scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: evidence, but still, that's another
discussion that we also need to have on a
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory level, but that is basically
how this situation evolved and where we
[SPEAKER_03]: are right now, to make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, maybe back to that issue,
you are able to produce more quite soon,
[SPEAKER_06]: will the Dutch government and the OMC lift
up the limit also, will more Bedokan hit
[SPEAKER_06]: the German pharmacies next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, a number of questions in one
question, so the question with regard to
[SPEAKER_03]: the OMC and the politicians lifting that
ban on sales, that is a question for them
[SPEAKER_03]: to respond to, so I'm not a government,
I'm just a company delivering to them,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can tell that the situation is
changing, the mindset is changing also in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Netherlands and the fear that
initially was there 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: like oh, Holland will be, it will be all
over the papers that Holland is exporting,
[SPEAKER_03]: truckloads of cannabis into Germany,
that was a political thing a little bit at
[SPEAKER_03]: that time, and we see that now fading
because cannabis is being taken seriously
[SPEAKER_03]: also in Holland, but we have to get over
the regulatory issues, we also see in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany, if you look at the German tender,
how much product is being asked,
[SPEAKER_03]: 4,000 kilos, how much did you sell in the
last, whatever, that is already too
[SPEAKER_03]: little, so the import situation is there
to stay for a while, I'm pretty sure,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will be difficult, again,
as David already pointed to, the Canadian
[SPEAKER_03]: issues are real issues too, they are also
not able to just export freely and do
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they like in that regard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's perfect for my next question,
what other countries could provide?
[SPEAKER_06]: There are lots of countries coming up
right now, the regulation is that country
[SPEAKER_06]: must have an cannabis agency, it must meet
the European GMP production, and it,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, in a case like Uruguay, it must have
a divided system of providing in their
[SPEAKER_06]: country to the medical and the
recreational market, that's quite odd
[SPEAKER_06]: detail, where we are allowed to import
from Canada with recreational market,
[SPEAKER_06]: but not from Uruguay, because they sell
recreational in the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_06]: but other countries will meet those
regulations quite soon, Israel,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm quite sure, is coming up on the market
this year, then we have attempts from
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamaica, maybe Australia, and a lot of
European countries, like Denmark,
[SPEAKER_06]: Poland, Greece, Macedonia, they are all
opening up facilities now, so in two
[SPEAKER_06]: years, we might have 10 countries
providing, and 20 companies, or 30,
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever, David, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think we have five countries
providing in a year, and have you got
[SPEAKER_06]: plans, are you talking to producers in
those countries, what is your bet,
[SPEAKER_06]: how it's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for asking, so, there is a few
things that we have done, and some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: are public, my hottest guess right now is
Australia, for the simple reason that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have a very similar pharmaceutical system,
as we're used to have in Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also in Europe, so, on top of it,
they follow the same strict rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have an MRA in place that allows us to
EU release tests in Australia,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is very comfortable details,
that are coming in here, they have great
[SPEAKER_02]: sun, they have stable political
environment, so I truly believe Australia
[SPEAKER_02]: will have a very good role in supplying
Germany, and the next time, I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: Macedonia being that hot, for the simple
reason that they, let's not forget,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have not even opened up their
exports, so we're simply talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: something hypothetical that could happen,
I know it's very over-hyped right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but let's stick to details, I know that
lots of things are going on in Denmark,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also in Southern Europe, Denmark,
I'll be honest, I don't really have an
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion right now, for the simple reason,
I know that lots of these big companies
[SPEAKER_02]: went to, that are also participating in
the German market, some of the big names
[SPEAKER_02]: are actually running, setting up a
facility, mostly retrofit facilities,
[SPEAKER_02]: but up to date, there is no facility in
Denmark, at least I know of, that is fully
[SPEAKER_02]: up and running, I would love to see that
we have the ability to actually grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany also, I agree with you,
we made multiple requests with the German
[SPEAKER_02]: beef farm, even to, to increase volumes,
because 10 tons that is currently on the
[SPEAKER_02]: tender, will way not be sufficient,
kind of medical loan is holding supply
[SPEAKER_02]: agreements for over 25,000 kilos by now,
for the next 36 months, just to give you
[SPEAKER_02]: an idea, we're only one importer,
on the German market, and we're very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very confident, that we can sell
this very, very easily, if that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: reaches the standard that is requested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's stick a little bit to this,
explosion of people, companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: taking part in that market, maybe again to
David, we at the German Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: Association, count 21 importing companies
right now, more to come, probably people
[SPEAKER_06]: seeking for making fast money,
what do you think, how is this going to
[SPEAKER_06]: develop, will it become more, will it be
more in a year, will it be less in a year,
[SPEAKER_06]: who will get through, who will get
problems, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm also aware of this, because we
see that lots of these companies are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming, especially in the last six to nine
months, and it seems to be a trend for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to tend to believe that it's very
easy, quick money, but this is a complete
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong approach in my opinion, this
industry is not a place for amateurs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and due to the fact how difficult German
regulations are, or EUGP regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there will be a big earthquake
in the industry coming in the next few
[SPEAKER_02]: months, from what we have heard,
what is happening with the we farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're also looking to it quite
carefully, but just to give some examples,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way a product is imported to Germany
right now is far off the regulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a very, I know Challings used to call
this a wild west, and he might be true to
[SPEAKER_02]: some extent, there is a very good chance
that by the time the first player in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, and I won't make sure it's this
player, will do it correctly, and will
[SPEAKER_02]: actually completely live the regulation,
that we do today, that are complying with
[SPEAKER_02]: the AMG regulatory, there will be a very
hard time for lots of these newcomers,
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, they don't understand the
regulatory, second, they are completely
[SPEAKER_02]: underfinanced, and third, is lots of them
are technically only built to be acquired
[SPEAKER_02]: by candidates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and on the other hand, you are the
example for the people being a startup
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself, just a few years ago,
and being very successful, and also others
[SPEAKER_06]: becoming millionaires in a short time,
so it will stay a little bit wild west,
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of them will get through,
some won't, but all of these more
[SPEAKER_06]: exporting countries, many more producers
coming into the game, lots of importers,
[SPEAKER_06]: will also lead to a huge variety in the
pharmacies of several products,
[SPEAKER_06]: we already have a big variety,
but then imagine, we might have 100,
[SPEAKER_06]: 150, 200 different kinds and sorts of
medical cannabis in the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_06]: so my question to Adam, what do you think,
what outcome will that have, will that be
[SPEAKER_06]: good or not, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, just to give a short answer,
variety in the pharmacies is always
[SPEAKER_07]: welcome, so it's good to have many sort of
medical cannabis strains in the pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there is another way to look at this
from the pharmacy's perspective,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is how those strains differentiate
themselves from another, so how those
[SPEAKER_07]: strains are different from another,
and who's telling whom those informations
[SPEAKER_07]: and those differences on the German
market, so this should be the physician
[SPEAKER_07]: that is aware of all the differences,
from those strains, and today on today's
[SPEAKER_07]: market is not the case, so it's still,
the number is getting better, that I must
[SPEAKER_07]: admit, but there's still the patients that
know more than the physicians,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it shouldn't be the case, so also if
you have many strains on stock in the
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmacy, you have a very big logistic
problems, you know, as narcotic drugs,
[SPEAKER_07]: it falls under different regulatory issues
in the pharmacy than just simple OTCs,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is quite a big problem for
pharmacies that are not specialized in
[SPEAKER_07]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, keep in mind that it's not like in
the States or in Canada where you get your
[SPEAKER_06]: recipe and as a patient go to dispensary
and enjoy to choose out of 200 varieties,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's the doctor who has to do it,
and decide which one single kind I put on
[SPEAKER_06]: the recipe, and then it doesn't help if
there are lots of brands not available,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's confusing the doctors,
they are, most of them are not able to
[SPEAKER_06]: really say which is the right choice,
so we'll see where that leads to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to go on one last issue
before we open up for questions,
[SPEAKER_06]: time is running, it's about extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first two extract hit the market last
year, I think at the moment it's still
[SPEAKER_06]: quite a small proportion, but there's also
a second extract coming up now,
[SPEAKER_06]: and probably this is the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question to every one of you,
asking for a short answer, starting with
[SPEAKER_06]: Sterling, what are your plans?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sticking to flowers or planning
extracts?
[SPEAKER_03]: The flower is the basis of everything,
we all know that, so that's what we now
[SPEAKER_03]: call API, the active pharmaceutical
ingredient or the raw material you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using to make extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been fully into producing flower
first, we are getting into next steps
[SPEAKER_03]: where we want to actually extract in the
product, get into standardized extracts
[SPEAKER_03]: from the raw flower, but that will still
be an API, it will still be an active
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe in the end will require medicines,
true medicines, registered medicines,
[SPEAKER_03]: clinically based on clinical research,
you have a proper outcome if you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: use this variety or an extract from this
typical variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently everything in the German
pharmacy also, and correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong, is happening under the rules and
regulations of compounding pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's actually, the product has to be
kind of made in the pharmacy itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: either by labeling, by weighing it,
or by even extracts, it's something we see
[SPEAKER_03]: in Holland happening also.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difficulty of making extracts from a
regulatory perspective, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that you're dealing with a controlled
substance and it has to turn into a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what we see happening in
Australia, by the way, so in Australia
[SPEAKER_03]: where things are moving very slowly,
but that's due to the fact that they have
[SPEAKER_03]: to develop real medicines and do their
clinical work on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a path we have chosen in Holland now
as well, we have done our first clinical
[SPEAKER_03]: studies on flower, that is helpful because
it allows flower also to be in the market
[SPEAKER_03]: and to stay there, but indeed next step
will be to come with more defined products
[SPEAKER_03]: in the field of extracts, et cetera,
but you need to be very aware that you
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot do that in the barn behind your
house, you need a true pharmaceutical lab
[SPEAKER_03]: with under certain certificates,
quality certificates, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: need to be in place in order to be able to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, who wants to continue with that
extract thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll pick up on that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now the extracts are really light
from clinics, this is what I can confirm,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's only our perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: So clinics, there are clinics in Germany
that only prescribe the extracts and the
[SPEAKER_07]: reason behind this is because the dosage
for the extract for the doctor is way
[SPEAKER_07]: simpler to follow up on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you provide the strains,
also if it comes down to the compounds,
[SPEAKER_07]: the extract is way more efficient than
just vaporizing or smoking the buds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to answer the question short,
yes, it has a great future, also most
[SPEAKER_07]: probably in Germany, and the greatest
since the doctors and the physicians are
[SPEAKER_07]: the people that allow you to use that sort
of medication.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, David, your thoughts and plans
about extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, technically it's the same answer I
gave you last year, we will have extracts
[SPEAKER_02]: on this market very, very, very soon on
one way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is actually a very good opportunity
that it will be around by Q4.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very interested in bringing extracts
to the market in accordance with N or F
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just highlighting this because I know
that at least half of the products that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in the market today are not in
accordance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to give the prescriber,
the doctor, the full transparency on which
[SPEAKER_02]: strain is used and non-changing strains
for this extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my very best knowledge, there is no
extract today on the market that is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually being that transparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make it actually possible that you can
follow up on therapy results by having two
[SPEAKER_02]: or three different strains might be in
Indica and Zativa in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very, very interested in having and
participating also in research for all the
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts and developing a path to finished
medicine will be definitely the next step
[SPEAKER_02]: than after extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's about on the second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have 10 minutes, 57 seconds left
for your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please tell us who is asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tick, tick, tick, tick.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's hear it again for Georg
and everybody on the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jonathan Goldman from Sunlight Green
in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is regarding what's your
opinion about all the companies that we
[SPEAKER_01]: see starting to grow in Colombia and in
Africa and the low production price that
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna come from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your opinion regarding that and
regarding the regulation, the GMP and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna regulate to that and what
you're gonna do about those companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing cheaper product?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whom do you ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's asking all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally understand your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Products, whatever is produced wherever,
if they have to come to Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: if there is an export or import license
for those products and that's a matter of
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulator who will actually then judge
whether the product complies with the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations as we have them here or in the
country where this product's being
[SPEAKER_03]: imported.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is likely to happen is that what
you see more in agriculture, if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: typical products and they wanna make a
typical extract from a product grown
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor or in a greenhouse or they wanna
purify certain compounds from it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will be relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to happen under the right
regulations, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that in a certain way,
there will be room for those products to
[SPEAKER_03]: come to market, but again, they will have
to be compliant in full with the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations as we have them here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to add something to this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there is a lot of competitive
prices out on this industry, but let's not
[SPEAKER_02]: forget about one thing, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I'm curious about getting the
cheapest market on prices on supply,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather find a supplier that can
actually deliver and up to date in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, Tellings is the biggest supplier
on the German market that's constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: delivering.
[SPEAKER_02]: This industry is not about, to me,
at least not to kind of medical values,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not about having the cheapest price
on our suppliers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to treat everybody fairly in the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to have everybody a fair
chain in this industry, and this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: makes us probably so significant,
so interesting as a partner also to global
[SPEAKER_02]: suppliers.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the next.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm August Veit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a pharmaceutical expert and
consultant, and I have a question to
[SPEAKER_05]: David.
[SPEAKER_05]: From my perspective, there are increasing
numbers of local authorities in Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: refusing import licenses because they
consider cannabis flower as a provable
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine because no compounding is done in
the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your perspective about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of things ongoing in the
moment, and we also have the possibility
[SPEAKER_05]: in Germany to ask Bfarm to have a
categorization of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my expectation will be that they will
ask them, and what will happen if they
[SPEAKER_05]: categorize cannabis flower as a medicine
which needs approval?
[SPEAKER_05]: This can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear this question quite often,
and I don't think this will happen for one
[SPEAKER_02]: simple reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis flowers today are still an API.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have achieved great results from
patients' therapies.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I have never heard that German
local authorities are stopping to give out
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proof that we have 21 importers in
this industry today that are trying
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves out and supplying Beto Kahn's
material to the German market is
[SPEAKER_02]: underlying my argument here.
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of it, import licenses themselves,
there might be a bit of confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is not this one import license.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several different licenses that
you have to hold in order to distribute
[SPEAKER_02]: into some medical cannabis in the German
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a wholesale license, narcotic
clearing, clearing from restriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have an import license.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a release license.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a license for ready
material, and so on and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not this one single license.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you for sure that at least
medical up to date never had an issue for
[SPEAKER_02]: obtaining an import permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the third company that ever
received a license to import, to
[SPEAKER_02]: distribute medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I think the number of increase
in wholesalers that try themselves out in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry is underlining that we don't
have an issue on the regulatory side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an issue on the supply side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have a question for Adam and
David.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're API producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we currently, we expect at the end of
this year to have a plant medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana extract under GMP with the drug
master file available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering if you can buy a plant
as an API, would you be able to buy the
[SPEAKER_04]: extract as an API and then in the pharmacy
by compounding produce an oil out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I answer your question,
let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's given you the EU GMP?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a governmental GMP?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is a private audit GMP?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a governmental GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually makes it by far easier
because the private audit GMPs I know is
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are a lot of consultants that
are offering services are definitely good
[SPEAKER_02]: to have to prepare themselves,
but are worthless when it comes to import
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are able to import raw extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do have an import, if you do have
an EU GMP certificate, certification date
[SPEAKER_02]: scheduled, I definitely would like to talk
to you after this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my opinion, or to my very best
knowledge, the only way to bring product
[SPEAKER_02]: in from any country is in a way that you
have raw extract today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would be the procedure then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the procedure then?
[SPEAKER_04]: We just ask our governments to,
yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we should have this discussion a bit
more in deep after this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very, very sure that my QA team
can actually help you in preparing
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself if we get together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was somebody who was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question went also to Adam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to add something?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can just give you a short answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes down to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I'm not a pharmacist, I can just
give you a short answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can definitely use that extract
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, this is Alfredo from Marijuana
Business Daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for David and one for
Yaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: David, you say you're the largest
independent importer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I understood correctly,
you're waiting for your first shipment
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canada in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also said that cannabis coming
from the Netherlands is being distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: equally or more or less equally among all
the importers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you explain how you are the leader
then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yaling, you are the sole producer in
the Netherlands as of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a tender last year that was
canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will restart again this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's being said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us more clarity regarding if
you expect to continue being the sole
[SPEAKER_00]: producer in the Netherlands or you await
more competition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just hurl on this question why we
are the biggest independent importer in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been in this industry in supplying
2,400 pharmacies up to date in the past 18
[SPEAKER_02]: to 20 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: That definitely gives us a competitive
advantage over all the new startups that
[SPEAKER_02]: are coming in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chance that you are walking into a
pharmacy and you would like them to order
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis and ask them if they know
kind of medical is very, very significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are providing the best service to
pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the most transparent player in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are currently having the biggest
customer service team that is providing
[SPEAKER_02]: excellent service to these pharmacies
every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have just been... Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have been just voted by internal
requests from consultants agency that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been voted as the best and most
reliable independent supplier in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch tender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it was canceled last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will probably come up very soon now
this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as we know, it will allow for
multiple producers in the Netherlands as
[SPEAKER_03]: it did from the beginning, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fun thing is that this tender process
in Holland is already relatively old.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the past 15 years, nobody actually
has seen this whole tender passing by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we see a bunch of interested
entrepreneurs who want to get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we expect that the outcome of the
tender will get into result by January
[SPEAKER_03]: 1st, 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be in the market for a while on
our own still in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's as far as it goes for
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are all basically waiting for this
tender to come out and actually show what
[SPEAKER_03]: the Dutch government, the direction of the
Dutch government will take on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's not enough time for another
question on my watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 13 seconds left.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it again for Georg Ward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone on the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great and very efficient.
Thank you.
