[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, we just want to give a big shout out
to Bang to bring Leroy Thornhill,
[SPEAKER_06]: the DJ from Prodigy, last night to the
after party.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was super fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Bang's a big supporter of the
ICBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sponsor a lot of our after parties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just one more time, give it up for
Bang, y'all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bang.
[SPEAKER_06]: And without further ado, you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see you in Zurich.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got a special deal going on today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Zurich's going to be off the charts.
[SPEAKER_06]: 5-star, 5-star, super spa, geiles hotel,
direkt oben die Stadt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Es ist wahnsinn, oder?
[SPEAKER_06]: Without further ado, yo, make some noise
for your own guy, Obelomar, gracious MC.
Hey!
[SPEAKER_06]: Guten Morgen!
[SPEAKER_07]: One more time for Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put this whole thing together.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony, Vinnie, Noel, Jesse, Tristan,
Delia, Randy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget everybody else's name.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were out late last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you came to the party.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a good time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're going to start the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to bring up the moderator.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the founder and the CEO of Green Rush
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to introduce everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Zeta City!
[SPEAKER_05]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this is about investments in
capital markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the far end over here, we got Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie is the Chief Operations Officer for
Bang Chocolate, the world's most awarded
[SPEAKER_05]: line of gourmet chocolate bars and
award-winning CBD products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bang, she manages the executive team,
contract negotiations, works with Bang's
[SPEAKER_05]: licenses in the US, as well as other
countries, and oversees this Cypress Hill
[SPEAKER_05]: Bang venture.
[SPEAKER_05]: With over two decades of operational
financial experience, she brings a
[SPEAKER_05]: pragmatic approach as a believer in
finding the win-win in every deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently, she's been recognized by High
Times as one of the 100 most influential
[SPEAKER_05]: people in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody give it up for Jamie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, we got Alexander Straub.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alexander is a German-born entrepreneur,
the head of the London firm Straub
[SPEAKER_05]: Ventures and Cambridge Accelerator
Partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a Rhodes Scholar at the University
of Oxford and eventually moved to New York
[SPEAKER_05]: to establish Lazard Technology Partners to
a $300 million venture fund.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2006, he co-founded voice over IP
specialist Truphone and was named
[SPEAKER_05]: technology pioneer at the World Economic
Forum in 2007.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2008, fast forward early to 2017,
he launched SnapMe, an app-based
[SPEAKER_05]: e-commerce company based on e-commerce
enabled via computer vision, machine
[SPEAKER_05]: learning, and AI in preparation for an
augmented reality and VR enabled world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it up for Alex here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, we got Gavin S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gavin is the CEO of AltaFlora that focuses
on developing cannabis science and IP
[SPEAKER_05]: through the value chain on genetics,
formulation, brands, and data.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has raised money in Europe for
AltaFlora through H&W and family offices.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also sits on the board of Oxford
Cannabinoid Technologies where they raise
[SPEAKER_05]: money from Imperial Brands, the largest
tobacco company in the world, and Cassie
[SPEAKER_05]: Verde Capital, that's Snoop Dogg's venture
capital firm.
[SPEAKER_05]: He also advised some of the largest
corporates in the UK around their cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody give it up for Gavin here,
please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to start this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the global CBD craze, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is going around CBD everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to start out with the CBD market in
Europe is expected to be worth 416 million
[SPEAKER_05]: by the end of 2019.
[SPEAKER_05]: This just came out in Rolling Stone like
seven days ago and 1.7 billion by 2023.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you seeing in terms of the best
CBD investments in the European market and
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically in Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any thoughts on what investors
should be looking for in terms of CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunities?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CBD companies that I'm seeing in
Europe were actually distributing our CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: products in Europe and have been for about
three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little bit of experience with it,
but what I'm seeing is a big shift in the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of the companies that are coming
forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more of advancement in tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were bringing my own capital to the
table, I would be looking for teams that
[SPEAKER_03]: are working cooperatively with the German
and the European government to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're going to be able to have some
long-term play because what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: in the US market versus what's happening
in Europe is that you guys are getting to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn from our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be looking for the teams that have
spent some time in the US learning from
[SPEAKER_03]: those mistakes and then are operating
within the confines of maybe driving the
[SPEAKER_03]: ship a little bit because I think the
companies that are really instrumental in
[SPEAKER_03]: driving legislations, they're the ones
that are going to make it because everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: else is going to come behind and follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's definitely changing the face
of everything, but it's also what we see
[SPEAKER_05]: in the US too is we have some states that
enact CBD laws as kind of an entry point
[SPEAKER_05]: for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really interesting to see in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alex, what do you think about the CBD
opportunities that are happening in Europe
[SPEAKER_05]: right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, clearly it's a regulated environment
and so investors in general react to
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory industries with caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen this in the kind of
alternative energy market, on the wind
[SPEAKER_01]: side, on the solar side, all regulated
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what it looks like CBD with
the Food Novelty Act, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be also in this category.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more open than THC, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, I think uncertainty
creates something what investors don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, I think in general,
caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, this is a once in a lifetime
opportunity because of the demand curve
[SPEAKER_01]: actually being created.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think one needs to balance both
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without any doubts, I would say that
actually well-organized governments in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe which have a clear plan and give
clear guidance to entrepreneurs have a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge advantage to create the diamonds
which are in the rough right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that mostly it will have
to stay on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will have to start in a regulated
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when we look about when we're
in Germany right now, the German
[SPEAKER_01]: government compared to the Danish or
others have given a clear guidance what
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be only a four-year
contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say these companies which are
achieving a license are going to be highly
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without any doubts, there will be huge
amounts of capital required to bring those
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen this in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long it took, how long it took for
patients to develop, I would say there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: slight advantage here because many
patients are registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a familiarity with the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, well, one has, as an investor,
has to balance both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: But uncertainty is not certainly
something, and regulation is not something
[SPEAKER_01]: investors look forward to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, certainly there's a lot of
uncertainty in this industry, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: with how we're just trying to educate our
governments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all about education and
awareness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more and more, we're able to educate
these governments on moving the path
[SPEAKER_05]: forward and creating a mechanism in which
we're able to move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what about you, Gavin?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start with a couple of data
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some survey data from the UK
which suggested CBD had brand awareness of
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% and 10% of the population had tried
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first thing to say,
this is a massive phenomenon driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: word of mouth from the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I'd build on Alex's point
to say that the regulations are shifting
[SPEAKER_00]: and that makes investors nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes entrepreneurs pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a bunch of folks in the UK look
at the recent EU FSA rulings and move from
[SPEAKER_00]: food into cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you'll start to see
entrepreneurs look for different,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, regulatory arbitrage is the way
to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be different regulatory
frameworks depending on the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: products, depending on the channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think smart entrepreneurs will
figure out how to play that arb game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart investors will figure out which
entrepreneurs to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's going to be a lot of
opportunity in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's going to be quite fluid
for the next few months in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the big change is going to be on
the back of the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if the US gets some clarity around
CBD, I think it's going to be incumbent
[SPEAKER_00]: upon Europe to look at that and say,
actually, we've got some clarity now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can bring that to the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we're
fighting hard for is a harmonized EU
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory framework for these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the fact that this is going to
pass at the federal level in the US gives
[SPEAKER_00]: us a good framework to start talking about
this stuff in this way across the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, big market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fluid at the moment around
the rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entrepreneurs will figure their ways
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll get some clarity through the
rest of this year into next year as we
[SPEAKER_00]: look to the experience of the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also think that it's an important
point that either entrepreneurs or
[SPEAKER_05]: investors need to be able to pivot at any
moment's notice based on their regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's changing constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a moving target, and we like to call
it dynamic compliance, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's a very, very important
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be able to be used to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of different opportunities
besides the CBD, are you seeing any other
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunities here in Europe besides CBD
that seem like they're worthy of
[SPEAKER_05]: investment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin, do you think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, on the medical side,
I think it's fair to say it's grown less
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly than people probably would have
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being here in 2017,
and there was sort of real hype around as
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex said in the intro yesterday,
there were only 1,000 patients in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's moved quite as
quickly as people have thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still feels like we're in the sort of
let's establish the regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of infrastructure building
happening, clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canadians have sort of been in,
looking at various different
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some Israelis in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are clearly some European
entrepreneurs looking at the space as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't grown, I think, from a sort
of market demand perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite as quickly as we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's still a lot of risk capsule
going in on the promise of future revenues
[SPEAKER_00]: from the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, aside from CBD, that's the space
that we're focused on, licensed THC
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine production.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alex, you have a pretty profound tech
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you seeing any new tech innovation in
Germany specifically that is worthy of
[SPEAKER_05]: investment that's kind of leading around
the world or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think two things to point out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think investment and seams come in
waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as a very venture capitalist,
you have seen this over the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very unclear in Germany at the
beginning in 1998 what will happen with
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have seen that we're eventually
caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created companies on our own turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we created them all around Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say we have been as successful
as the United States because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: early.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I think in the patient medical
and doctor pharmaceutical relationship,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a lot of lack and slack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that we are at the breakout of
formulating machines, software machines,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can identify much better disease
profiles than any human doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's due to the intake of
information by software machines on a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine learning side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the input and in layman terms
by patients into a mobile phone and then
[SPEAKER_01]: an analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one has to imagine the human has,
we have around 7,000 identified diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 500 are treatable or have a medical
product against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look down into a single
disease, it's often defined and treated
[SPEAKER_01]: with like one pill or one medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take autistic children,
what we now know is that the DNA decides
[SPEAKER_01]: much more about the treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen more and more companies which
coming from that perspective of saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, first identify what you've got,
better than the doctor because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then actually bring those patients into a
DNA test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Define what the DNA tells you about,
let's say autism and then define the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will give us a huge increase from
500 diseases to 7,000 diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six and a half thousand we don't treat
today because they're so rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of it, every single
disease can be treated in four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways depending of your DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of us I think have different
effects on THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has something to do with our DNA
and how we are made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there you have a huge
potential going forward, which is much
[SPEAKER_01]: wider than what we're seeing here in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's quite determined as well what
we're doing with THC or CBD products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of pioneering for different
investment strategies with different
[SPEAKER_05]: innovators in that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of want to move on to raising
capital in some of these capital markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Canada, obviously Canada is a leading
country doing this with access to public
[SPEAKER_05]: markets as opposed to the US or other
areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, do you want to kind of talk to us
about how to raise capital and what that
[SPEAKER_05]: looks like?
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell us a little bit about the
landscape, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bang is getting ready to go public
on the Canadian Stock Exchange in a few
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that process has been through an RTO,
which is a reverse takeover.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have gone IPO and we felt the RTO
would take less time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in reality, it didn't, even though we
had a clean shell from a mining company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I would say to you, if you're out
there going into the Canadian market
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for capital, just do your due
diligence and be thorough about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had several companies come to us with
promises of extreme valuations and
[SPEAKER_03]: different things going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is if you know your
company and your value and your ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: generate revenue, you should have a pretty
good idea of what your valuation should
[SPEAKER_03]: be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when companies come to you and they
give you something that doesn't make
[SPEAKER_03]: sense, you really need to drive the ship
and say, no, that's not where we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at the end of the day,
you've got to offer your shareholders real
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue, real value, and you've got to
know what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to speak about what Alex was
talking about with the technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant that we're all talking about in
these rooms, we don't know what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: capable of healing, what we all have is
anecdotal evidence that it does work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's working legitimately for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited about being part of this
industry for technology, for healing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I would also like to see is a
real common sense approach to the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that people are going to use marijuana
recreationally as well, and that some of
[SPEAKER_03]: that legislation has to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping the Europeans get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at the taxation and look at some
of the frameworks around allowing the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to be used recreationally and not
just medically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one thing they can learn
from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing I want to say is
the real commodity that I see as a brand
[SPEAKER_03]: is shelf space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, the US is screwing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't scale up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't build one manufacturing plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And move my product across state lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means theoretically, I would have to
build 50 manufacturing plants to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: multi-state operator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang's been able to get around that
through licensing and other opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, the companies
that capture shelf space, that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: supply that's diminishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cannabis is going to become a
commodity, and it's going to be grown in
[SPEAKER_03]: areas where the sun is plentiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be able to get back to
the price of the commodity getting low
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to turning into just a typical
industry and pharmaceutical quality
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine for people who want medicine and
recreational quality medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: craft cannabis, and all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, it's the brands
that are going to matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the companies that are building
brands that are capturing the hearts and
[SPEAKER_03]: minds of consumers and capturing shelf
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the ones that are going to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I would be looking to put
my money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the Bang brand is strong and
powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the biggest ones don't exist
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like all the cannabis consumers that
are going to exist aren't in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've got to reach that point of
social acceptance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin, you want to weigh in on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This brand point is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look to the alcohol industry,
which also went through a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, the first brands that were
built post prohibition were those brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that established the functional attributes
of the category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in London, Gordon's Gin was marketed on
the fact that it wouldn't kill you and it
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't destroy your liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like this first phase of
cannabis brands are almost normalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: this product for the mainstream with a lot
of these functional attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to get the munchies
and eat your whole kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have psychotic
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of these years of
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once those functional
attributes in the category are
[SPEAKER_00]: established, then we can start moving to
aspirational brand building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the most impactful brands in
cannabis are yet to be built.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I'd say from the alcohol
perspective, brands are built in the
[SPEAKER_00]: on-trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brands in the alcohol space are built
in consumption venues like bars,
[SPEAKER_00]: like pubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have those spaces in cannabis
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be those
countries that regulate on the consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: side first that will offer the most
appealing brand building opportunities for
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ritual that is involved
with cannabis consumption that is yet to
[SPEAKER_00]: be defined for the products that we're yet
to invent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all know the ritual when you go
home and have a glass of wine or for a
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker who goes outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those rituals are going to be
invented for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really smart brand marketeers will
tap into the psychology to work out what
[SPEAKER_00]: those rituals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of investment potential with the
brands that are yet to be built tapping
[SPEAKER_00]: into trends that we're yet to figure out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can absolutely relate to that coming
from the San Francisco Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is ground zero for the cannabis
industry from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot of brands come out of
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, licensing the IP and
scaling by IP instead of scaling by
[SPEAKER_05]: footprint is a methodology where you can
cross state lines or even cross country
[SPEAKER_05]: lines just scaling by IP.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's an important factor
where you're looking at some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: investment strategies and whether or not
the management team is even focused on
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about raising capital in Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any insight on that,
Gavin, on how to raise capital in Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what does that landscape look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really changed in Europe,
actually, in the last three or four years
[SPEAKER_00]: on the back of this domino effect of all
these countries legalizing medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least putting in place frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so initially, it was almost difficult
to talk about it in somewhere like London.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you approach someone to talk
about this specific topic in a space
[SPEAKER_00]: where, in the UK, this was illegal until
November last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last six months, it's really
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're starting to see a lot more
interest from the venture capital
[SPEAKER_00]: community, a lot more interest from some
of the larger investment banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more interest from the high net
worth and family office space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still feel we're in this space of sort
of educating a lot of the investors in
[SPEAKER_00]: London.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite unsophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a lot of education to do
on the Canadian public markets about the
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics that really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has an impact on how investors in
Europe look at these opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I'd say is I think we can
draw parallels here between the tech
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and cannabis in that Europe tends
to be a little bit more conservative when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to valuations, looking for
entrepreneurs to get traction or an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of unit economics before
they really want to scale a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I feel like there's a lot more
risk capital in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think it's going to be an
interesting space for Europe over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: few months and years as we start to see
more educated investors get into the space
[SPEAKER_00]: with larger checks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alex, you have a distinguished career
in venture capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you weigh in on some of that between
Europe and Canada and what it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: raising capital, especially for cannabis
companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's unclear who are the
structured venture capital groups in that
[SPEAKER_01]: space right now in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's a lot of recycling of
capital due to the huge success in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the groups I'm working with in somehow
had huge successes in Canada, have huge
[SPEAKER_01]: capital available, and they're willing to
invest it at very fast pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is unclear yet in Europe where
to invest it, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much clearer right now in other parts
of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the United States is still a
fantastic growth market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think structured capital is needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at a much bigger scale than
people imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a certain respect, I calculate that
Germany would need about 1.5 billion of
[SPEAKER_01]: investment to make the whole industry in
the country or grow up in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my back of the envelope
calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when it comes to banks, it's quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have spoken to several banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some Canadians are still close to
the idea of actually dealing and having
[SPEAKER_01]: companies in their structures which are
cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_01]: While European banks or German banks are
sometimes much more liberal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go to the chief ombudsman of the
banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have no problem, actually,
to touch that industry at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some respect, it's more liberal here
than when you speak to certain investors
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the United States as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken to some investors in London.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just say, well, our pension funds
don't allow us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And full stop, end of story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it needs a special approach for
the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, also an opportunity,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, speaking of banks, I mean,
the United States, I mean, really,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't use an FDIC shirt and bank to
get loans or anything for a cannabis based
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we do have the Safe Banking Act that
looks like it potentially may pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this has been a problem for
entrepreneurs and especially retail owners
[SPEAKER_05]: or anybody that's in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's mainly been a cash and
cannabis carry business up until this
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, more and more, we're seeing this
become more accessible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because of the compliance factors,
you're not able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been really hard for the United
States business to scale without private
[SPEAKER_05]: funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But more and more, we're seeing family
offices get involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's part of the reason why we're
going to Canada as US based companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to get that capital so we can scale
and grow within the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a really interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think as we go forward, we're going
to see more of this access and being able
[SPEAKER_05]: to access this capital domestically.
[SPEAKER_05]: But speaking of which, there's a lot of
companies out there in Canada that have
[SPEAKER_05]: really high valuations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing a lot of opportunities
coming to investors with these blown up
[SPEAKER_05]: valuations that you can't support those
valuations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you guys seeing in terms of
deciding on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you guys make investment
decisions on those valuations in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: investing in those companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to take it, Jamie?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting topic that gets
bounced around a lot, especially at these
[SPEAKER_03]: conferences, because people are saying to
me, knowing that we're getting ready to go
[SPEAKER_03]: public, what do you think about all the
valuations in Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they all inflated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't everything we just talked in the
green room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think people are going to lose a
lot of money coming up pretty soon because
[SPEAKER_03]: of these overinflated valuations?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I look back at the tech
industry, the companies that made it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember thinking, wow, they want $3 for
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I will say is I think when banking,
when that domino falls in the US,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to be a game changer again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because just in the years that I've been
in the industry, I'm from Montana.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a saying, if you don't like the
weather, wait five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's the same thing in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't like the way the industry is
rolling, wait five minutes and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be a new law.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think once banking falls,
that domino, and we can bank like every
[SPEAKER_03]: other industry, then the dust is going to
settle and we're going to start to see the
[SPEAKER_03]: real money come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real money, the big institutional
funds, they're not here yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a couple of people dabble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kronos got a big investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen some of the alcohol companies
and the tobacco companies bring real
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those aren't actually real dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the real dollars are coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to take banking for that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't even seen Wall Street jump in
or any of these big groups come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about this, Gavin,
about the valuations aspect of these
[SPEAKER_05]: companies and things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can believe the Canadian valuations,
if you think they're going to dominate
[SPEAKER_00]: global cannabis in perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think there's going to be
competition, these numbers look inflated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only way that I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the interesting point on banking
is going to be right now, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: discount applied to U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks traded on the CSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the moment this changes,
the banking question, these valuations,
[SPEAKER_00]: these multiples will all change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk profile for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: companies becomes a lot safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability of the Canadians to compete,
lacking this U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a real inflection
point on some of these multiples that will
[SPEAKER_00]: come on the back of further U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to look at how this is
impacting on Europe, though, because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the story that is promised right now in
Canada is around global growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we sort of need to see these
European markets move for the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: valuations to be justified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think some chickens are going to
come home to roost over the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: months as we start to see real data coming
out as to the actual size of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of feels like what we really
need to be talking about is demand
[SPEAKER_00]: generation in Europe, which is a tough,
tough question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It speaks to some of the points Alex was
making around sort of the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, the future of the clinical
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it requires all of us to engage with
health care regulatory agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical establishment, to make these
markets move to have any chance of these
[SPEAKER_00]: valuations being justified.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Alex, what do you think about
company valuations and how that's being
[SPEAKER_05]: evaluated based on some of these inflated
companies that are doing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's based on hype, you know,
mainly.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm very cautious because I've seen
it over the 20, 25 years I'm in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry on the tech space.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a gross industry, it's very hard to
value a company because you have the PEG
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, they look high, but I would
say you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you have seen that,
I've seen that on Facebook when
[SPEAKER_01]: Zuckerberg, Mark was running around Davos
with two billion valuation while Myspace
[SPEAKER_01]: had twice the numbers of users and sold
for six, seven hundred million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw it was Larry and Sergey and
Google, tiny companies, others had tried
[SPEAKER_01]: so search, Alta Vista, et cetera,
don't underestimate growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if a market is growing,
a lot of mistakes can be just forgotten
[SPEAKER_01]: and companies can grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it's paper
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these companies using that paper money
to grow into markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Germany, for example, will be a
gigantic market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see a million patients,
maybe more consuming two to three grams
[SPEAKER_01]: per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a five, six billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can create, let's say, 10 times,
multiply create in Germany, 60 billion
[SPEAKER_01]: market cap on the stock market alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take the Canadian companies
jointly, I mean, sure, they have high
[SPEAKER_01]: market caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they are three times overvalued,
like in Aurora and I was doing 300 million
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them three billion market cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a gross story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't bet against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to be very careful if you
want to short those to these businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen that throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clearly, people will definitely
decline in value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these companies which make
strategic mistakes, some of them won't get
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses where they want to get the
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be cautious in terms of
acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will fall to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a process of the next two,
three, four, five years, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we are not here to actually
bet for stock market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies which already floated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to build companies from the
base and the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, that's absolutely
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm speaking of public companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the difference or private
versus public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's discuss the difference in how
companies seeking investment decide on
[SPEAKER_05]: which investment partnership to go with.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's best for them strategically from a
partnership perspective, from a brand
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective, from a growth perspective?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Jenny, about the
difference between those two and how you
[SPEAKER_05]: approach that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We discussed it a lot at Bang when I first
started working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't really looking to go public.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we just kept having banks come to us
and say, we think you guys will be great
[SPEAKER_03]: as a publicly traded company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to take you public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw them looking at us as an
opportunity, which caused us internally to
[SPEAKER_03]: start having a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I would say is the beauty of
private money is you can make private
[SPEAKER_03]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody isn't looking under your
skirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're public, everybody knows
everything as they should.
[SPEAKER_03]: The public is putting money into your
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need to know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to know what your vision is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it forces you to flesh out your
vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: It forces you to get your strategic plan
in place and have some discipline that you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to have when you're private.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we saw going public as a multi-fold
reason to make our company better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one was we have so many devoted fans
that write to us and ask, how do I invest?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your chocolate changed my life kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was just a part of that
notion that Scott wanted to open it up to
[SPEAKER_03]: the people that have built our company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was sort of an altruistic
decision in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, we don't want to be afraid of
having people look at what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang's been a trailblazer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the first nutritional fact panel on
an edible product before we sold one
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Lloyd's of London product liability
insurance before we sold one product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, you were buying brownies
out of Ziploc bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we brought that sort of regulation to
the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we look forward to the challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: The challenge of having people look up our
skirt because we've been operating a
[SPEAKER_03]: really clean company for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that those are the,
that's the rub.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to make your decisions in
private or do you want to make them in
[SPEAKER_03]: public?
[SPEAKER_03]: And some companies don't want the dilution
that comes with, you know, if you're an
[SPEAKER_03]: owner and you've built a company and you
go public, you're going to give up some of
[SPEAKER_03]: your equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some of that that you have to
think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a small piece of a giant
company is just as valuable as a large
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of a smaller company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so public capital also allowed us to
expand into global markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to dominate the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to bring our brand to the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you do that with private
funding?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of high net worth individuals
out there that could have helped us go
[SPEAKER_03]: that route.
[SPEAKER_03]: This seemed like the right decision for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I totally can agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also think that it's the difference
of your business model too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in my case, you know, I've just
launched a technology, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a piece of software, SaaS based software
that helps with permitting licensing and
[SPEAKER_05]: accelerates the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the same thing with the Vancouver,
you know, met a group who was a,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a mining company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to relist on the CSE,
but instead of an RTO, what I did was
[SPEAKER_05]: instead was a qualifying asset transaction
to help them relist, which doesn't require
[SPEAKER_05]: the five year financial audit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, based as a canvas company
in the U S even as a consulting company,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was very difficult to find someone or a
company that would, you know, basically do
[SPEAKER_05]: a five year audit on us and put their name
on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead we did a qualifying asset
transaction, which allowed them to relist.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a different methodology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us, we needed access to public
markets to get access to this capital for
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunities coming through our network.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the case of Jamie's, it's just
scaling and scaling the business and
[SPEAKER_05]: scaling the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ours, we just needed access to that
public marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so it's just different ways of
doing that, which I think is quite
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Alex?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what is your opinion on private
versus public, like in some of the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think in the last years,
due to, I think the large funding
[SPEAKER_01]: available for companies, companies have
chosen to stay private much longer in this
[SPEAKER_01]: sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, due to, I think not enough
investment, people have chosen to go
[SPEAKER_01]: public early and being a public board
member for 10 years, it's a huge burden
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a very expensive exercise to be
public company and forbid you decide,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to go private.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a lengthy process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've gone through that,
that's quite painful to go public to
[SPEAKER_01]: private again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I would say a lot of these companies
go prematurely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there would be more capital
available on the private side,
[SPEAKER_01]: people would choose to stay much longer on
the private side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen that in the tech space
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, but right now I think people
don't have another choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gross market, people are hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people go prematurely to the stock
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there will be a lot of
shakeout and a lot of people won't be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to handle it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my choice would be to stay private
longer until you're a much larger company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of it, what do you gain
from being a public company?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of companies which went public even,
I mean, in Canada, they didn't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: float.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the founders, they have nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: From this IPO, you can't do anything with
a stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're lucky if one of the bigger ones
buys you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a balanced approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, some early ones will be winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might be a big, big loser being
too early public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's much better to work
with a consortium of investors which you
[SPEAKER_01]: can trust, which are on your board,
which you can work the process until you
[SPEAKER_01]: get into a stable situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: To take the companies public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, in Germany, we have a long
history of companies which are hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have never gone public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin, do you want to weigh in on that a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's probably worth
remembering that it was a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: speculative mining index in Canada that
led to a lot of the funding of this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a point in time when there was
a lack of access to capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really changing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we will see companies stay
private for longer in Europe as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: building out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a couple of companies that are
listed in London on the NEXT exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in much the way the CSE has started to
gather a reputation around being a place
[SPEAKER_00]: where companies can go get liquidity,
I think the NEXT in London will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: become that sort of place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Sativa and Ananda investments
on the NEXT.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to AIM in London about
potential parts to liquidity for companies
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Stenicare in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to see some companies in
Europe emerge and look to public markets
[SPEAKER_00]: for capital rather than private.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, I think I'd echo both
points that we're going to make mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulatory frameworks are going to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I think, better to adapt your
business in private while you're in this
[SPEAKER_00]: quite fluid space where things are being
figured out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd actually like to open up some
questions because I know I'm sure you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of questions for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get started on some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take it once again for the panel,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go this way and then that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: This question is principally directed to
Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: You talked about governments needing to
give a clear plan and guidance to
[SPEAKER_04]: entrepreneurs to make the right decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you focus a little bit on which
governments in Europe, in your opinion,
[SPEAKER_04]: have the highest chance to fulfill this
requirement?
[SPEAKER_04]: Focus a little bit on Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, in my humble opinion, seems to be
on the forefront in many of the
[SPEAKER_04]: developments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the subsectors you would put your
money to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please be brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, very difficult questions,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very hard to answer, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very biased for Germany because I'm
German.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've seen it in a lot of
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will get to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we get to the point, we will do
it, I think, correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will be a huge success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say what I see so far,
it's Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I mean, we're in a single
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're free and open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So others might have a chance as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel that from an organizational
perspective and curiosity, this market is
[SPEAKER_01]: highly educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're open for a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're open also to adapt new
products from the consumer perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmacies are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctors are much more ready than
anywhere else compared to England.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a clear pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, politically, maybe not everybody
wants that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when people see the positive
sides, and this has to be coupled with
[SPEAKER_01]: research, R&D, and more medical studies,
et cetera, I think we will get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm not fully and 100%
informed about everything in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people in the audience
might have a lot more knowledge than I
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, great panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you also for saying what you did
about the German market, because I work
[SPEAKER_02]: for the startup here in Germany,
MedPayRx.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my question to you is twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of bring back one of the themes
that you talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Germany, obviously, the regulatory
markets are a little bit tougher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Frankfurt, where the Deutsche
Berge has this entire industry from North
[SPEAKER_02]: America under super secret probation,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has to do, I think, with the
maturity of the industries you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you guys see?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sort of trying to elicit your
comments and helpful suggestions about how
[SPEAKER_02]: American and Canadian funds are getting
information about the opportunities here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this being Germany, there are
incubators.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are accelerators.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's government money, if you're
looking at it from science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the investors I know and talk
to are delighted to have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see in America about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Any question?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who was that directed toward, Margaret?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, look at this conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see the usual suspects here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're right now in their offices
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they will show up in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or one creates new, essentially,
investor types.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see at the moment is people
recycling their capital and trying to jump
[SPEAKER_01]: into this once in a lifetime opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this industry, I think, is ripe and
has 30 years in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can invest into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can build step by step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of very, very good companies
will be created in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of employment, a lot of
taxable income.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's absolutely worthwhile to be here
and discuss it with all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, I think the capital in this
market needs to be convinced and recycled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the Canadian market, out of the
American market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think right now, what I see is the
Canadians investing into the American
[SPEAKER_01]: market next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will see a lot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think we will jump to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a bit of time still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as things become clearer, good
management teams become clearer,
[SPEAKER_01]: good strategies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a bit of time,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the American perspective,
that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious for bang about what's
happening in the European market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm finding out about things like your
program incubators and things by basically
[SPEAKER_03]: getting out of the office and putting
myself out there meeting people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my second year at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Berlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made some strategic partnerships here
last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm back, because it was
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to meet the people who are
doing things, you've got to go meet them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't information, I would tell you,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not know about you, Marguerite,
if I hadn't come here last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to your point, there isn't information
that I'm finding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have my ear to the ground of the
capital markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's happening in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the efforts that I've made to
figure it out for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than coming to the ICBC every time
you can to meet all the people and all the
[SPEAKER_07]: movers and shakers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for our fantastic panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you all for getting up so
very early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you were at the Gretchen last
night, you know that we kind of turned it
[SPEAKER_07]: out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of.
There was a lot of.
