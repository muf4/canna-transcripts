[SPEAKER_00]: And our next speaker coming to the stage
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited to have him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, if you have conversations,
please have them outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to discuss cannabis in the
European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chief Economist of Whitney Economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Bo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's a pleasure to be here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody for traveling,
coming a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an economist in the cannabis space,
and there's not too many of us around.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was at the grocery store the
other day, and I had this sweatshirt on
[SPEAKER_01]: with a cartoon character called Scooby Doo
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the caption said, dooby dooby doo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this van's smoking, we be toking,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the person at the checkout counter
said, hey, that's a pretty cool
[SPEAKER_01]: sweatshirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, where'd you get it,
and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually it came around to that I
was an economist in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I track the market and the trends and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, oh, that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I paid for my groceries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was leaving, she said,
hey, good luck with that made up job of
[SPEAKER_01]: yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so yeah, I'm an economist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not making this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today I'm going to talk about the
European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give kind of a global and a
US update, because everybody wants to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the US numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll look at this in terms of the
EU market, give a little bit of data and
[SPEAKER_01]: spin, and then compare and contrast a
little bit of the policy going on between
[SPEAKER_01]: the US and the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Whitney Economics is a consulting firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do economic consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide data to the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a forecast, a total addressable
forecast for every country in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're clientele on practically every
continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been in the industry now for about
nine years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you need any data, just let me
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I said, we're just going to do
a little compare and contrast after I give
[SPEAKER_01]: you some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, just to level set, cannabis is really
three industries in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the adult use, it's medical,
and it's industrial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And industrial is then also broken down
into three markets, the fiber and grain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the cannabinoid market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important to know this
because people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think hemp, they think CBD or minor
cannabinoids or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to educate people on
this and differentiate between the three
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of countries are reforming right
now, and they're looking at it from an
[SPEAKER_01]: economic development perspective,
from a jobs perspective, and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based upon our numbers, combined,
it's over a trillion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about that, trillion
dollars, the US market total addressable
[SPEAKER_01]: is about 100 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add in hemp, you add in the medical
market, the European market, the Asian
[SPEAKER_01]: market, a trillion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people really have difficulty
putting their arms around that,
[SPEAKER_01]: a trillion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's going on is that a lot of these
countries want to embrace cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're kind of waiting for the US to
set the trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them the okay, and then they'll
follow suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I think could end up happening,
though, is that as the EU starts deploying
[SPEAKER_01]: legal cannabis, especially on the adult
use side, like in Germany, in the Czech
[SPEAKER_01]: Republic, and elsewhere, then the European
market could flip this around and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: become the big driver in cannabis reform
around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's over 70 countries around the
world that have some form of legal access
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's massive numbers, 350 to 500
million consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are conservative numbers because
a lot of the researchers look at surveys
[SPEAKER_01]: and they deploy these surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the surveys go like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm from the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you smoke weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in states and countries where there's
prohibition, then the responses are,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I don't know what you're talking
about, even if they are consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of the numbers are actually
lower than the reality of the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with a total market of $350 billion
for medical and adult use, total
[SPEAKER_01]: addressable market, illicit and legal
combined, combined with hemp, that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: you to a trillion dollars really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned, countries are
looking at this for economic development.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at it for jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at it to reduce healthcare
expenditures, to reallocate law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a real compelling argument for
legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the US, little known fact,
10 states out of the 38 that have legal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis actually saw sales decline last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth was really low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was anemic at 4.5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the industry thought that the
surge that came from COVID and increased
[SPEAKER_01]: the demand over 2020, 21, 22, that that
was gonna continue indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as people came back to the market and
are back to work and back to school,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they didn't have as much of an
opportunity to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sales dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really suppressed demand in the
first half of last year on a global basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the US in particular,
inflation started taking a bite out of
[SPEAKER_01]: people's paycheck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the consumers were resistant at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spent about the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they had a discount on flour,
for example, they would backfill with
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles or a pre-roll or what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd spend about the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the year wore on, inflation started
taking a greater bite out of their income.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they started spending less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so pre-COVID or post-COVID decline
combined with changes in consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior, it really had a devastating
effect on the market overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of spooked investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It spooked operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, operators did more with
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't hire as many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't deploy some of their
operations on schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: They deferred and delayed and like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this really hurt profitability in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we deployed a survey in Q4 of last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 24% of the respondents were actually
making a profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you think about that,
that means 76% of the operators were
[SPEAKER_01]: either breaking even or losing money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is kind of alarming when
you're an investor or when you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: operator and nobody's making money and
demand is going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the industry really struggled in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not forecasting that it does much to
improve until 2024, 2025 in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some inhibiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's policy issues like safe banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which gives access to finance,
gives some protections on bankruptcy and
[SPEAKER_01]: the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxes are very heavy in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is suppressing the growth and
the profitability of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interstate commerce would open up a lot of
opportunities for producer states,
[SPEAKER_01]: for consumer states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would level prices out and make it
uniform across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of policy issues
brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's not much in terms of
forecasting that this is gonna be resolved
[SPEAKER_01]: over the next years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably either push out into 2024
or beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a presidential election.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even after that, even after the
reform occurs, then it'll take a while for
[SPEAKER_01]: these policies to be implemented at a
national level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a comment in one of the previous
panels about protectionist policies and
[SPEAKER_01]: access to markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really resonated with me in some of the
federal legalization bills that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: bantered about in Washington DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this opens up the US market to
foreign competition almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this could have a devastating effect
on the market on operators in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have a kind of a higher cost
of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other international competitors could
come in at a lower cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now compete with a pretty substantial
market already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 40,000 licensees in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, people are waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Countries are waiting for the US to
reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Mexico, when constitutionally it's
legal, but they haven't deployed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't deployed their rules and
regulations yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't look for them to deploy anytime
soon until the US gives some type of
[SPEAKER_01]: indication about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a forecast here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just refreshed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We track data from every state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the ramps and the deployment
of the regulatory systems in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: key states are lagging right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've had to take down my forecast
in the near term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look, even though there was only 4.5%
growth in sales last year, there's still
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be about 12% growth this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's far below what was forecasted
even six months, nine months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned, we saw negative
growth in 10 states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new growth is predicted to be in
the bigger states like New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're really struggling right now
with the deployment of their legal
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the product categories like
flour, edibles, tinctures and like are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually facing deflation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the conversation globally and
in the United States is talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: inflation hurting consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the opposite for cannabis
operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're seeing deflation lower prices and
lower profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an issue to really keep an eye
on as you look at the markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: either the US market or European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then inflation is starting to impact
startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you think about it, interest
rates are rising, the cost of your loans
[SPEAKER_01]: is increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's taking a bite out of your
budget and you have to kind of earn more,
[SPEAKER_01]: generate more revenue in order to cover
those increased costs of your capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so startups are not getting out of the
gate quick enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also suppressing the growth of
the overall market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of European market, it's about a
$70 billion market or 62 to 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add in some of the other European
names, some of the other nations include
[SPEAKER_01]: Russia, it could be as much as $260
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by revenue, it's maybe the second
largest market in the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a consumer perspective,
it's like the fourth or fifth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia and Africa have more consumers,
but they just spend less because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have as much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And European, as you all know,
is looking at reforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put Spain here as a courtesy,
but not a whole lot of reform going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think where things are really,
the action is really happening is in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you get legalization and adult
use rolled out successfully there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could have this domino effect
throughout the rest of the European
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could in turn influence the
rest of the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though there's consumer markets
in Germany and Czech Republic and Italy,
[SPEAKER_01]: even some of the periphery countries are
looking to be the producers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: suppliers into the central European
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's opportunities in the periphery
countries just as much as there's
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities in central.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're starting to see this through
the medical programs and the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very little data on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as key stakeholders in this space,
any chance that you can collect data and
[SPEAKER_01]: share data amongst yourselves,
the better off you're going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just make better decisions,
more informed decisions, and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: demystify what's going on in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collect data all the time, but it's
just hard to come by, especially at the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's five key countries from a total
market that's illicit plus legal that make
[SPEAKER_01]: up the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: A majority of it comes from just five
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Italy is, some people will say,
well, what about Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shouldn't that be the top?
[SPEAKER_01]: But from these UN surveys, there's more
consumers of cannabis that will admit to
[SPEAKER_01]: governmental survey takers that they
consume in Italy more so than they do in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of makes sense culturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there could be as many as 150
million consumers in the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a pretty substantial market
if you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could, combined, even be larger than
the North American market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of supply, so I took a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a total market forecast for Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at it from a consumer
perspective, about 3.5 million consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a big market here, and that
requires about 880,000 kilos of cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: output.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not just flour, but that's
cultivated output required for tinctures
[SPEAKER_01]: and oils, balms and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about it, there's only
24,000 kilos authorized in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an ICBC stat that they just
published out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real good number for perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 6,000 kilos just a couple of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Spanish market is very,
very underserved with their current
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there needs to be, if it's going to
go adult use, or if there's going to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion of the medical program,
then there's going to be a need for
[SPEAKER_01]: increased cultivated output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a common mistake that
countries have when they deploy legal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, is they tend to focus initially
on the retail side, and then they go
[SPEAKER_01]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't realize that cultivation is
the longest lead time item.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, they should understand
their supply before they start trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it and process it and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Spain, 880,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as things mature, there's going to be
increased competition from Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: from other European markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Spain is positioned to such an extent,
similar to Malta, to where they could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: conduit from Africa and into the European
Union, especially on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to talk a little bit about
industrial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I looked at 10 product categories and
looked at the total market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what could be peeled off and
supported, just very conservatively,
[SPEAKER_01]: by industrial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at automobile parts and
alternative plastics and foods for animals
[SPEAKER_01]: and human consumption, and lithium battery
replacements, you can actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: batteries using fibers from hemp,
plastic cutlery in bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market for hemp is actually larger,
and the opportunity is actually larger
[SPEAKER_01]: than the adult use and medical combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I started off by saying that
it's three markets and then three markets
[SPEAKER_01]: within three markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people don't realize the real
potential of industrial cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're starting to realize it and
embrace it more so in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the European markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also some environmental
and climate related issues that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed with industrial cannabis as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some differences in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty interesting to think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, they say hemp is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis on the adult use and medical side
is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates this havoc from regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't know how to handle that
legal versus illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they really muck it up on both
sides of that fence, of the THC fence that
[SPEAKER_01]: delineates what is legal and what is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're adopting these policies at
the state level which just aren't very
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're actually hurting the growth of
both markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some infighting in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the adult use and medical side and
the industrial side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's some competing supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially on the intoxicating cannabinoid
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've got this competition,
this fragmentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just don't see that as much in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the differences are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my firm is studying all 27 countries
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing country reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do out later on in the summer for every
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking at adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at industrial opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe treats this much differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They consider it all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they try to figure out how to
regulate it from an industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: From adult use perspective and the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one area of commonality is how to
address cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at the cannabinoids that
are derived from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing some products come in from
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: on the cannabinoid side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not a whole lot right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though there's this real intense
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's this, well on CBD there's this
policy that says if it's legal in one
[SPEAKER_01]: country in the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's mostly legal for distribution
and sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all the countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you apply that to adult use and
medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there could be this rapid change over
in deployment of adult use products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post German and Czech launches into the
other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that happens then you've got a
quick turn on your market opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to drive policy back into
North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little bit of a counter
narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there's a real
possibility because the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is just dragging its feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still dealing with banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interstate commerce and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the EU has that already wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they don't have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the key differences
in between the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: market and the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were to break out my crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what economists do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I think as Germany sets the tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll set the tone for the rest of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of even the industrial cannabis
countries are looking to Germany for
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be an acceleration of
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was mentioned earlier about GAP and
EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think certified seeds and stable
genetics are going to also be an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those will set the standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will really be more on the medical
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things will be kind of centered around the
public safety focus and more medical in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature rather than social or adult use
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then things will just kind of
normalize once things get deployed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hemp will come on strong as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of exciting opportunities in the
European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in terms of recommendations,
you know, go to gatherings like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start your network now before the markets
change and change rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Develop your supply chains and your
contacts within the supply chain so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can establish these relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then expand on them and leverage them
to increase your revenues, your profits,
[SPEAKER_01]: your capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be very, very conscientious of your
cost structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too far out of your skis,
over your skis because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: costs will come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices will come down as the market
normalizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very competitive here because
everybody wants to supply into the EU
[SPEAKER_01]: right now because it's the only place to
supply medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got South Americans,
you've got Asians, you've got Australians,
[SPEAKER_01]: North Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all trying to vie for this very
same market that the EU suppliers are also
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to supply in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being disciplined about your internal
costs is really, really critically
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And use data.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need data, I know where to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, you know, act local because
cannabis is a loan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a localized issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then think global because it's really
a global marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I have for you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to, if we have some time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, darn, we don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have time for questions,
but I'm sure if you want to cost him in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hallway, he would love to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time for Bo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, Bo!
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, Bo!
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
