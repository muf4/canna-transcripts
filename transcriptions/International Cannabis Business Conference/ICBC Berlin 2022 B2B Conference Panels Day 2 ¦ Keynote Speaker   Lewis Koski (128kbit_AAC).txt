[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be back to ICBC again this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my second time attending this
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really looking forward to this this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year was so good and I made so many
contacts and got the chance to learn a ton
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's happening here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited at the opportunity to
come back and be part of this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to maybe just spend a little
bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is always uncomfortable for me so
bear with me but just kind of talking a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about my background so you guys
can give some context for some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that I'm going to talk about
and some of the experiences I've had here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the campus industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into that I started my career
as a police officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a police officer in a city just
outside Denver Colorado and while I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: police officer I was going to grad school
getting my MBA in international business
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got recruited by the Department of
Revenue which is the agency that does all
[SPEAKER_00]: the taxing etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have enforcement groups like
law enforcement agencies that oversee
[SPEAKER_00]: gaming, liquor and in 2010 we started
overseeing cannabis regulation when we
[SPEAKER_00]: started licensing all the businesses in
Colorado and that's when I transitioned
[SPEAKER_00]: from the gaming division to the marijuana
enforcement division to help establish
[SPEAKER_00]: that agency and when I first got involved
in that on the medical side my boss told
[SPEAKER_00]: me it's gonna be about 10, 15,
maybe 20 years before we legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for adult use but it was only two
short years later and we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional amendment that changed the
law from just medical to including adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use and we are implementing that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my job at that time was as the director
of the marijuana enforcement division and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was responsible for starting a new
agency, leading the teams that created all
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulations in Colorado and also I
served as a subject matter expert with
[SPEAKER_00]: other legislature to help kind of inform
how that policy could evolve over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all in all I've got background in law
enforcement, background as a policymaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also got a business background now
that I've been working in the private
[SPEAKER_00]: sector with Metric since 2019 where we
operate in 20 different states where we
[SPEAKER_00]: uptrack all the cannabis for regulators in
those states and then I also have academic
[SPEAKER_00]: background and the reason why that's
important is because over time I've really
[SPEAKER_00]: developed a passion for arriving at
balanced public policy because I really
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's possible especially in the
cannabis space where everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, industry, public health
officials, government, we can put public
[SPEAKER_00]: health and safety first but also do that
in a way where we balance the business
[SPEAKER_00]: interests of cannabis companies operating
in the framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd start with where I've had
most of my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you look at this map of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that 36 different states have
adopted some form of legalization whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's medical or retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way if you see the dark,
I'm sorry the bright green states are the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those all have medical programs as well
but 36 states that are operating with
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and as I mentioned before we
operate in 20 of these states tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for government but what I think
is most important I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasize here is 10 years ago most of
these states didn't have any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: program and these changes don't occur
unless you have public policy to support
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So public policy has to change from and in
our case in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: it's changing from a policy that was more
focused on criminal enforcement and
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning to a regulatory model that
was much more permissible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I think about it that way and I
think there's and I look back on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I've witnessed over the
last 10 years operating in the space I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: say there's like three forces that are at
play that if you can kind of understand
[SPEAKER_00]: those three you can kind of start to
anticipate when you think public policy in
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular area is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's these three areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I want to talk about is the
problem I think that is a stream that's
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all three independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all three streams come together you
have a window of opportunity where you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see public policy change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first stream is the problem stream and
in the problem stream basically the public
[SPEAKER_00]: sentiment is changing such that you can it
favors one or new outcomes or evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: public policy over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of this as public opinion
shifting from one aspect of public policy
[SPEAKER_00]: to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned earlier we were shifting
from criminal enforcement type of posture
[SPEAKER_00]: put more towards a permissive cannabis
policy and we knew that because public
[SPEAKER_00]: polling was telling us that the mood was
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The media was talking about the need for
change so the problem was really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of what I heard yesterday
about Europe is the same as that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mood's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first stream that's the
problem stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is the policy stream and the
policy stream just think of it as
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who wants to get in involved
with solving that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the problem gets to a point where
most people kind of agree that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem it's time for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The status quo needs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start seeing lobbyists, entrepreneurs,
businesses all starting to come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to be able to solve those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they start to collectively get
together to come up with ideas on how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to best be served.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that does really well then the
third stream is the political stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the political stream is such that you
start to see elected officials or people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in positions of trust that have
the ability to create public policy like
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to get actively involved in
coming up with the actual outputs like
[SPEAKER_00]: bills and new regulations and those kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw this play out in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: time and time again from one state to the
next state where the problem stream the
[SPEAKER_00]: policy stream and the political stream all
started to converge and create these
[SPEAKER_00]: policy windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one consistent thing that happened in
all the states was a interest in being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to collect data that can help inform
a lot of those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other consistent piece of that was
track and trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where metric is really mostly
involved is helping government track
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from the time it's a baby plant
to the time it's a final product at the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we collect a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why data is so important is
all three of those streams, the problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: the policy, and the political,
they all feed off of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the data to make their points for
change in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all three of these streams actively
involved or actively increasing and
[SPEAKER_00]: converging here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking more specifically about
Germany, we all have seen the end result
[SPEAKER_00]: or like all three of these streams active
over the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at some of this data,
certainly in Europe, it would appear that
[SPEAKER_00]: public sentiment towards legalization both
on the medical side and the adult youth
[SPEAKER_00]: side is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So public opinion around a particular
policy issue is really, really important
[SPEAKER_00]: to that problem stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the policy side of things,
which is almost everybody in this room in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way, shape, or form is trying to find
solutions to that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do we change from the status quo
that we currently sit in and get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next level of change that's going to be
meaningful, that can protect public health
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety, but also create a business
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second thing I'd like to say
is that we also, just back a quick step,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody in this room is in some
way, shape, or form actively involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you know it or not, in the policy
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to find solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard yesterday on several of the panels
and from several of the keynotes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are the ones that are most likely to bring
the best solutions to government to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to fix this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think makes this moment more
exciting than anything is that yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: we also had politicians that were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had appointee, we had elect officials
that were basically telling us that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've already kind of concluded that the
current situation in Germany needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we want to see change and that
that change is likely to be in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: either expanded medical or adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though I think we didn't get that
clear framework, like this is exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do, this is exactly what
the bill is going to look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very symbolic to have people who
are operating in the political stream come
[SPEAKER_00]: here yesterday and talk to us about how
they're committed to some form of
[SPEAKER_00]: advancing of legalization policy here in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're excited about what's happening
here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three streams are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have public sentiment is
really geared towards more towards
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, or at least it's heading
that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of groups getting together
like this to come up with solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the politicians are actively involved
in change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we're kind of like somewhat in
agreement that that's the situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should start thinking a little bit more
about what government's role should be in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like one of the biggest
challenges that government faces in this
[SPEAKER_00]: is balancing all the different interests
that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of explained earlier the three
streams, the problem stream and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are engaged in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This policy stream and all the groups and
people that are involved in that and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the politicians that are involved in the
political streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of explained all those as being
monolithic groups that all agree on the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all forms or there's all
different types of opinions on how this
[SPEAKER_00]: policy should evolve over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And government's role should be to try and
help include all those different voices to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out where the bridges are and being
able to form public policy that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hadn't seen it myself, if you're
skeptic or just really tired because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so early in the morning about it,
if I hadn't seen it for myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably join skeptics in the room on
how challenging that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it is challenging and it is
hard, I really believe that you can reach
[SPEAKER_00]: public policy that balances public health
and safety and some of the main concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: that government has, but also be able to
allow for a business or an industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: can not only survive in that, but actually
thrive in that arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the government's role should be trying
to balance all those interests and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like four things that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through these pretty quickly,
but there's four things that we've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see as success factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when government really considers these
four things deeply and they're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of developing public policy,
if they take these into consideration,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a real strong likelihood of having
a strong regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one's implementation
timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is including diverse
stakeholders in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about financial
expectations, in particular like tax
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and what's important there,
and then also the centralized data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna go into each of these in a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the implementation timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what often happens is public officials
who are responsible for writing the first
[SPEAKER_00]: public policy, they pass it, they go out
on the steps of parliament or the steps of
[SPEAKER_00]: the state house, and they're high-fiving
each other with their big accomplishment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where the real work begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where regulators are coming in to
implement the policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses are trying to make sure that
they can keep up with the short timelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen time and time again as
government have been implementing this
[SPEAKER_00]: policy is that they didn't give themselves
enough time or they didn't consider all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different voices that were important
to determine whether or not those
[SPEAKER_00]: timelines were realistic or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple examples of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, the testing facilities that
are responsible for providing tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not enough of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this public policy in place
that says it's gotta be January 1st of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, January 3, and you have to do all
this testing, and there's not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: testing facilities to actually test the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or similarly, there's this expectation
that there's going to be 200 cultivations
[SPEAKER_00]: that are licensed by January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be 500 stores, and they
don't take into account the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: local jurisdictions, so cities,
where these licensed premises are,
[SPEAKER_00]: have all sorts of processes that they have
to go through to prove a business that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not even candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can take six months to a year
to get that done, and so if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about that, oftentimes the tax
projections are off because those
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses didn't open up as quickly as
they thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the implementation timeline side of
things, what I would just make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to understand is that
you've gotta give yourself enough time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's even more important is you have
to make sure that you include the right
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholder groups in the process of
determining what those timelines are,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you don't, chances are good
that you're going to miss something and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to be able to implement
on time because it's just literally not
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for the different dependencies to
be met in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diverse new points.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that area that I was talking about
earlier that I'm so passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot reach balanced public policy in
a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So government officials, and I'm a former
government official, I admit I couldn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't just listen to a few people and
then lock myself in a room and write a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of policy and have it be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to include as many stakeholders
as you can to the table to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: better understand what their needs are,
what their limitations are, and the types
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that they can or can't do to get
the policy implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very, very important in
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would say that with the
research that I did while I was finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: up my dissertation, a couple things that I
found that helps make public policy
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and that is if stakeholders are
involved in the process, feel like they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been heard during the process,
chances are good they're going to support
[SPEAKER_00]: that policy going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a government official, I wanted as
many stakeholders' support as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets even better if they feel like
they can educate others on their position
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can learn from other
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I saw law enforcement's
mindset change a lot during the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: process when they were hearing from
industry and some of the challenges there
[SPEAKER_00]: were of getting the right labeling
requirements on labels, how quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling regulations change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might take six months for them to
actually be able to turn that around and
[SPEAKER_00]: get the new labeling requirements put on
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really interesting to see law
enforcement in particular say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, wait a second, I hadn't even thought
about all these challenges to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought businesses were always able
to move really quickly and so they learned
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being heard, being able to
educate, get educated, but also ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: every stakeholder that's involved in the
process regardless of which stream you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you want to be able to look at the
public policy when it's done and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see where I influence this public
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get everything I wanted,
but I got a bunch of what I wanted and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can live with this public policy
and I can support it going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diverse viewpoints is really,
really important for government to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing I wanted to talk about was
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax revenue and the financial expectations
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about you, but I've heard a
lot of politicians when they think about
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing cannabis, they kind of
gravitate towards the tax revenue that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and oftentimes the expectations
they have are high because they think that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis businesses are wildly profitable
and that they're wildly successful and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just rolling in cash and so we
should be able to tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we heard yesterday, Canada,
I also know that California and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other states, the tax rates are really
high and a lot of those were set when the
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale price of cannabis was $1,500 and
now when you have more and more players
[SPEAKER_00]: entering the market, the price of
wholesale cannabis is going to go down and
[SPEAKER_00]: so tax models based on those types of
wholesale prices can have impacts down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road and so expectations around taxes
should be that you can certainly fund the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that need to be focused on from a
taxing standpoint, so the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, funding, different types of
drug treatment programs, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not going to be able to fix all
your billion dollar problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to fix any
social injustices that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: fix just with cannabis money, but it will
fund itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis legalization and the taxes
that you get from it can do some really
[SPEAKER_00]: good work in that case, but it's not going
to fix roads, it's not going to build new
[SPEAKER_00]: schools, it's not going to do a lot of
those other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So setting some of those financial
expectations as a government official is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important, but it's also be really
mindful of how you structure that such
[SPEAKER_00]: that industry can have competitive pricing
to an illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to compete with the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, then it's difficult and I
think people always ask me, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: what keeps you awake at night when you're
government official trying to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that oddly enough was I was
really concerned that consumers wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: shift their buying patterns from an
illicit market to a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid that the price was going to
be so disparate that that wasn't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be something that they did, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were hoping to try and set up
the regulatory framework such that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was some level of parity or at least close
between an illicit market and a regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about this, the cannabis market is
very artisan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very tied closely with the
group or the producer of their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not easy to get them to
change, even if it's better quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product that's tested, there's good
information on the labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to switch those buying
patterns, the taxing structure can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: such that they can't compete in price.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to talk about of
these four is the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this gets really into my
wheelhouse and my role at Metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked a little bit more about
what track and trace is, but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, as I mentioned before,
to everybody in this ecosystem around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that we have data to
inform decisions about the policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's trying to increase public
opinion about the potential for a credible
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market, whether it's trying to
find new solutions to complex problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that we face in new regulated markets,
or whether it's politicians using that
[SPEAKER_00]: data to help evolve or evaluate the
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a great opportunity right now
in Europe as governments are contemplating
[SPEAKER_00]: new regulatory frameworks to create a data
collection methodology that helps to
[SPEAKER_00]: inform all of the stakeholders in the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do as a company is we track
cannabis for government from the time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little baby plant until it's buying a
product at the point of sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that data is utilized to inform a
lot of those decisions that I was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important thing I want to say
here is that it is possible to efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: collect this data during normal
operational business routines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And utilize that data to be able to keep
your regulators informed almost in real
[SPEAKER_00]: time, so that the work that they do to do
audits, et cetera like that, is not
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a hardship for the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very important that
government can be efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking about roles for government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very important that they can be
efficient in how they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant, every movement of that plant,
through the supply chain, harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the testing results, all the
transportation, and all of the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: transactions that happen at the wholesale
tier and at the point of sale are
[SPEAKER_00]: collected in companies normal,
like everyday business systems that they
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those business systems typically integrate
with our system and they share data back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth so that government has one
database with data in it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently collected all the way through
the stream of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, regulators don't have
to learn 20 or 30 point of sale systems or
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 20 different ERP systems or various
different data analytical systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to know their system and the
licensees report while they're doing their
[SPEAKER_00]: normal business activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their systems report back and forth into
Insymmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a little bit deeper dive on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As marijuana is planted, each plant,
once it gets to a certain height,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets a tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tag has information about the name of
the license, where the license is located,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as those plants work their way
through the process, as they trim them,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they record waste, all those things,
all that information like movement from a
[SPEAKER_00]: veg state to a flowering state,
all of those data points are collected
[SPEAKER_00]: until it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as that material is ready to move
either to a manufacturer to create
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates or it's ready to go to a
store with smokeable cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the transportation's information is
collected and stored in the system along
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the testing that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also go so far as to collect,
depending on what government wants,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the nutrients and pesticides and
things that were used in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we're currently working on some
additional functionality in our system
[SPEAKER_00]: where licensees, if they want to report
sustainability measures, they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do that in the system to how much
water, how much energy, those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things would be things that they could use
to help not only inform their own business
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions, but also to keep government
informed on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line is this product gets tracked
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Government has real time access into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can monitor activities for
compliance in real time as the data's
[SPEAKER_00]: being collected, and they can make it a
lot easier for compliance to be shown and
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated without having to go in and
move plants around and scan barcodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm getting ready to close up,
because I did want to leave a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: for questions if I can, but I wanted to
just like, the benefits of having a good
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace system and the benefits of
having, collecting the right data along
[SPEAKER_00]: the way is really crucial especially at
the point we're in for demonstrating
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility of the regulated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of us are really interested
and are genuinely concerned about public
[SPEAKER_00]: health and safety and wanting to be able
to show that the industry can demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: to other stakeholders in the space that we
can form a credible, regulated framework,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we care about public health,
we care about safety, use, consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things are very, very important
to us as an industry, and we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to be able to demonstrate that,
so it creates transparency in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about transparency in the
marketplace, I'm not talking about just us
[SPEAKER_00]: as an industry making the case to
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's us putting government in a position
where they can be transparent with us too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're gonna regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do this, you can be reasonably
assured that you're in compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things are really important,
and by doing that, we're all kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from having a really safe
marketplace where product quality goes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: product safety goes up, and we can provide
a much better product that is at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: price where consumers will change their
buying patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also too, there's the security side
of things where we're talking about being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to ensure that illicit actors that
are not wanting to on-ramp into the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated marketplace are not able to
participate as easily in the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace because the regulated
marketplace is such that it shines a
[SPEAKER_00]: bright light on illicit actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant by itself is indistinguishable
as a regulated plant or a illicit plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the regulated marketplace can really
benefit from being able to secure the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market or the supply chain such
that it makes it much more difficult for
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit actors to get in to the industry
or infiltrate it and degrade our
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last thing is just the reporting
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a regulatory background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from a lot of the interactions that
I've had with licensed businesses that
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrating compliance and the cost of
regulation can be very, very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone to great lengths as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work that I did as a
policymaker was based on hitting that
[SPEAKER_00]: balance to where businesses in the
cannabis industry not only can survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really thrive if it's done well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can report and reduce those costs of
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I would also just say even
though I focused on track and trace and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the benefits of track and trace,
all four of these things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking right now are also benefits or
good outcomes for any regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about creating efficiencies for
businesses and building us a secure supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'd love to take a few
questions if we have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louis Koski, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Louis Koski.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we treating weed like it's yellow
cake uranium?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for one question up here,
and then we have to move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Louis, thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian Wath with Elevated Signals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious if you could comment on the
alignment of best interests in the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you guys are contracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, you guys are contracted by the
states or the government as your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can the alignment of business
interests in terms of data and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: government wants to track be better
aligned in terms of regulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can that happen in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm understanding your question right,
I think what we've seen in the US and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is possible here in Europe is for
government to be really in tune with what
[SPEAKER_00]: the business interests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody recognizes the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard this time and time again in
the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an interest in making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to create profitable businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if government can get past the
fact that businesses are looking for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have other needs that they're trying
to meet, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of companies in the cannabis
industry that are mission-driven companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that care about patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about providing quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of the same objectives
that government has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to make sure that they're
aligned with the burdens of being a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of a regulated community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we think it's so important for
government to make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: engaged with stakeholders to better
understand those needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just hear a couple of comments here
and there, but actually meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: engagement with them to better understand
what their needs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, too, having efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most people here have been to
cultivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to hundreds of cultivations in
my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no way to audit plants that
are in a veg state to a flowering state
[SPEAKER_00]: without moving them all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to create a system where
government's able to be able to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: much more efficiently without creating
business disruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we're trying to balance those
needs, you have to be able to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the right level of public health
and safety versus what's the business
[SPEAKER_00]: needs and then create systems and
processes like that so it's efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time, Louis Koski.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
