[SPEAKER_01]: Here to lead us on our final panel,
discussing innovations in hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies, is a freelance journalist,
a huge YouTube star in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's here for us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been at almost every single ICBC
we've thrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Michael Knott.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the last panel today,
which is called Infusing Technology into
[SPEAKER_03]: the Emerging Hemp Industry or Infusing
Technology into the Emerging Hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: Industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually choose, but we decided to
focus on infusing technology, but on
[SPEAKER_03]: technology which should be infused into
the new hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the cannabis industry is also
talking, infusing is also a thing of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry, but that's not the
topic we discussed today, just as you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, it's not about infusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about growing hemp, and it's about
using new technologies for a harvest that
[SPEAKER_03]: was within the European community
forbidden until 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no technological progress in
the hemp industry, or in growing hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: in farming hemp, for nearly 60 years,
because it was a forbidden plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the machines, all the technology the
new industry started with was developed in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 1920s and in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, there was a gap of 60 years,
and all the farmers who started in the
[SPEAKER_03]: late 90s, when they regulated the hemp
farming, had to use all these old
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why we decided to put a light
on
[SPEAKER_03]: how it is working today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did this emerge, or do the people,
or do the farmers still have to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies that are like 60 or 70 years
old?
[SPEAKER_03]: For this reason, I have two panelists from
Slovenia, which are very experienced in
[SPEAKER_03]: the hemp business.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the one side, I have, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the one side, I have Petra Marinko,
she's well-known here in Slovenia for her
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp business, or for her hemp company
called Nabi.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's producing cosmetics with natural
ingredients, focusing on processing,
[SPEAKER_03]: and focusing on clean products without any
chemical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right, Petra?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Petra.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Mark Bogdan, together
with his wife, he has a small hemp farm
[SPEAKER_03]: close to Maribor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the beginning, as he told me,
of course, like most of the Slovenian hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers, a few years, six, seven years
ago, everything was focused to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the hemp plant is not only CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is only a very small part of the hemp
plant, and the CBD market, meanwhile,
[SPEAKER_03]: that the Chinese control the CBD market is
hard to make money with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to make money if you only
produce CBD, or CBD buds, or CBD products,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the hemp plant exists of more than
only CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mark is dedicating the hemp plants in
seven years, and also looking for new
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and processing technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right, Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you see, we're not talking about big
agricultural factories when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking mostly about small farmers,
small companies trying to get into a
[SPEAKER_03]: market which is regulated differently in
every EU country.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all should know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite we have a common EU law when it
comes to hemp, a lot of countries have
[SPEAKER_03]: their own regulations when it comes to
CBD, when it comes to buds, and when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to other derivatives of the hemp
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, my first question to you,
Petra, when it comes to processing hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You produce hemp products since when we
first met, you were already very
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how do you achieve the pureness that's
needed, and did anything change ever since
[SPEAKER_03]: you started when it comes to technology in
the hemp processing?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things changed, some for the
better and some for the worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expose better ones because I'm a
positive person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And regarding the processes that we use
into cosmetics and I would say product
[SPEAKER_02]: making, because we don't do only
cosmetics, we do also textiles and some
[SPEAKER_02]: other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing that we try to do is to
maintain cleanliness of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we started this, it was very,
very hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we always wanted to be a bit different
because we tried to find the things that,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, with extracts, we had
problems at first, finding the solution
[SPEAKER_02]: for the bioavailability, which is a big
problem with hemp, with extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we tried to do many, many technology
processes that could get us higher
[SPEAKER_02]: bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We produced liposomes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we started very fast to implement the
technologies into our processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's changed a lot because now,
people's minds are changing, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I see now, a lot of,
I would say, a lot of producers of any
[SPEAKER_02]: kind are thinking about implementing hemp
into their businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, we are dealing not only with
bioavailability, but we are also thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of how to reduce the plastic
waste, how to reduce microplastics coming
[SPEAKER_02]: into our products, how to reduce,
I don't know, how to make it circular,
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in terms of packaging, for example,
I have, here is one of the latest,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, thank you guys for bringing
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is packaging for our product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we took a step back to make two steps
forward with packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, one of them is the aluminum tube,
which is 99% recyclable, and we know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are using mycelium and hemp to make
packaging, which is a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's light material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can pack things into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can post it easily, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in terms of your question that you
ask, how is it changing, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: changing in many, many ways into better,
because we can use a lot of things that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, seven, eight years ago,
we couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is, I think it's a main reason
to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Petra.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, before I come to Mark, I have an
additional question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is talking about THC,
about CBD, about cannabis smoking,
[SPEAKER_03]: vaporizing medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody is talking about sustainability of
the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that so?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from architectural background,
and I knew hemp before I knew CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I knew it in terms of construction
material, and materials that it used to be
[SPEAKER_02]: used instead of flak straws, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we are not seeing that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because it's too expensive,
because it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, for example, with hemp lime,
you can use waste material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's just a term of connecting waste
material with another material and
[SPEAKER_02]: building something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I believe that maybe this is happening
because of the ban that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there's still stigma around it,
also in construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know why, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that is happening is
probably because it's hard to break the
[SPEAKER_02]: building society standards, in terms of
getting into the new materials,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing- That's also a little bit
like corruption.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit, I'm just wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say that, but it might be that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are starting very interesting project,
also here in Slovenia, with promoting
[SPEAKER_02]: these materials, and trying to break the
system, in terms of these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think the future will bring also
very nice things in hemp, other hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies, used also in construction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just in small details, which you meet
every day in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who of you likes paper straws?
[SPEAKER_03]: None.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think none of you likes paper straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't, they don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were hemp straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: They worked very well in Germany,
but the company went bankrupted,
[SPEAKER_03]: because nobody bought those hemp straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't find any investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go to Burger King, or
McDonald's, or to all those ugly places,
[SPEAKER_03]: you still find those paper straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is nobody producing hemp straws from
McDonald's?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not understand this, because hemp
straws work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really drink through them for 30
or 40 minutes, not only for one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is one thing what Petra
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people just only think in their own
bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: People do not leave their bubble,
also when they try to find new markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's really time to come to Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry it took a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, you're a producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a hemp farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I talked to first hemp farmers in
1998, either they had to harvest manually,
[SPEAKER_03]: or they had to use machines from the 30s,
which were made for other kind of hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: than we have today.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you harvest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use machines?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we still made everything with the
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Slovenia is pretty much a small
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot go everywhere with big
machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for my farm, it's that type how we
live with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have the touch with that
special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we go on that way,
that we made everything with the hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are pretty much small farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we enjoy in that business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, as long as you harvest
manually, what kind of technology do you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to use as a hemp farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed a lot of that in eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now high technology producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of machineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, can we fast to do something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, press for cold oil press,
or protein made, or all that things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lower cost of electricity and all
that things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are on the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think that we know everything about
hemp, how to do around hemp, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: are now on the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people think that we know everything
about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry, we are on the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what can we do, everything
from the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if politics and industry and everybody
look in the same way, then we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the way how or what can we do
from the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look on that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask you, besides you producing CBD
products, can you use the rest of the hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: plant you produce economically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: To use the fiber, to use the seeds you
produce economically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this more a side business that you
do because you are convinced of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I look on that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take also the roots from the soil
because we need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's absolutely economical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are too small for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia is too small that we can produce
the fibers because we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we use everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce CBD on a little bit different
way without alcohol, CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We press the dry material, and the result
is dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that material, it's perfect food
for animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use everything what we have from the
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made some small parts of isolation
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that small part of isolation
material, we made isolation in our
[SPEAKER_00]: accommodation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small accommodation, but we can use
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last two years, we made a lot of time
on hemp flowers fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody on the world don't ferment the hemp
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make the alcohol from hemp
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after two years, I can say,
yeah, we think that we know how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's also a new technology you
developed yourself, can't you say so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if we don't have technology,
we can do that because we must know which
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar we needed, which temperature we
needed, which fermentation culture we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many that culture we needed,
and we must measure everything from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much high technology for
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask you one another short question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if people from Slovenia know
that, but despite we legalized cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany, growing hemp is still regulated
stricter than in the rest of the EU.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have extra strict hemp laws,
which will not change before next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: They announced to change them now,
but CBD butts, for example, are not
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to be sold in shops in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in general, our hemp farmers have
trouble with authorities since 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is that here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you supported by authorities,
or is it more that you have a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble and it's a little bit tricky with
authorities?
[SPEAKER_00]: We falling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start eight years ago, we have in
Slovenia 600 square hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we falling under 150 hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's the situation where we
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that not changing in next 10 years
because the industry don't see,
[SPEAKER_00]: the politics don't see the opportunity
what we feel, not we see, because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is one of the way for all the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that not changing in couple
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Petra, we just heard it went down to 150
hectare cultivation here in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this does not sound as if there isn't
a broad market.
[SPEAKER_03]: What has to happen so that especially from
the building industry, hemp is accepted as
[SPEAKER_03]: an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because 150 hectares for a country is
actually nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, the change must happen to see the
whole plant and the use of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think when people and industry and
politicians will see that this is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: a very good way to make money also and to
do something and it pays off economically
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that needs to happen to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I think we have so many
innovative projects in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology is building very,
very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the help of European Union also
as we heard, hopefully we also get the
[SPEAKER_02]: funding to do projects like that,
innovative projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that it might happen that
the offer of hemp industry or I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: the production will actually go up because
the market will dictate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can say that within construction
business, construction industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: architects and everything, everything is
going to sustainability and circularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cannot avoid hemp if you're
talking sustainable and if you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: circular, if you're talking non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are three things that are key
points for every European funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever government is doing is only
green, sustainable, and circular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's impossible to neglect a plant that
gives so much in future, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I look on the world market,
I can see that most hemp is grown in China
[SPEAKER_03]: and in non-EU countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: What role can the European community and
the European Commission play when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to hemp cultivating?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can they support it with subvention?
[SPEAKER_03]: With money, would that help?
[SPEAKER_03]: The question goes to both of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that help you if you could as a hemp
farmer be supported by European community
[SPEAKER_03]: because they support all kinds of farmers
but no hemp farmers as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, my opinion on that question is that
Europe is small village on that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that small village, some companies
said what can we do and what can we not
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason why hemp don't go
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if we found solutions on small
business and we're growing and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and we're growing to that point
that all around see, okay, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity also for us, then we can
change mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Petra?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it will happen and European Union
will be forced to do something about hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cannot ignore it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is happening in all industries so we
can see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been into cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see that in textiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see that in construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always something wrong with hemp
for not being the plant that has the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with its potential shown in every part
of this, for instance, things that I just
[SPEAKER_02]: applied, I think it cannot be ignored.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, would you think just for the
audience to know seed production in the EU
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to hemp seeds is very
limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are only a very few companies
producing seeds and the farmers are not
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to produce their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to buy the seeds from the
companies mostly located in France or in
[SPEAKER_03]: Italy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to be compliant with the EU
hemp catalogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And different from former times,
the farmers do not control their own
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that help if farmers could,
like in former times before hemp was
[SPEAKER_03]: banned, could control the seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that help?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is there a sense behind regulating
seeds on the EU level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Slovenia we have good seeds
already 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seeds can grow on our region or
they can give it the best material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we made some changes,
I think it's the best solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every country which has enough growing
material, they know that grow on that land
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect, they must have that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we lose all our Slovenian
seeds from the reason that we go on the
[SPEAKER_00]: way where go EU Union.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know this is a very rare treasure that
you have the seeds from former times here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because hemp cultivation in European
community was forbidden in 1981,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally forbidden in 1981 or two or 83.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after this, all the hemp producers in
the Western EU countries had to give away
[SPEAKER_03]: their seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very rare to have seeds from
before 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should keep that as a treasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that can be again chamber in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we will see when somebody see what
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look on that way that every nation in
European Union must have some material
[SPEAKER_00]: because that representative, the nation,
Slovenian nation or German nation and
[SPEAKER_00]: French nation, and they have perfect
material for France.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have perfect material from
Slovenian, then I think we can say that's
[SPEAKER_00]: our material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our growing material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our Slovenian people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I don't know, German people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we represent our nation,
our history, and we have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what can we change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think new age generation can change
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that they change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just add something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the same comes to the
construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be very nice if we would take
a step back and learn from our ancestors
[SPEAKER_02]: how they did it, also with hemp and
natural materials, and infuse it with
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we know now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did that with cosmetic products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can have botanicals that are
anciently known to be very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are implemented in our products
with new technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do this in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can do this in construction
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we should always look back when we are
looking forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to give the audience an example,
hemp was grown before World War II.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only male plants were used for fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only female plants were used for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The male plants were harvested four weeks
before the female plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody growing north of Paris did not
produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those knowledge is gone because the
European community does not allow male and
[SPEAKER_03]: female seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds are all hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a farmer cannot draw a selection
like he did 60 years before if he wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate on fiber or if he wants to
concentrate on seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all gone within the so-called EU
hemp reform in 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my last question to you is,
we're talking about new technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we mentioned a few examples for new
technology in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in how far would you agree that we
first have to implement a new politic
[SPEAKER_03]: before we can talk about new technologies
and the big, construction, production,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, big range construction?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in how far would you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree very much because if I go
into whichever part of the business that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known now, I would say, for example,
I will take construction, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Politics is doing a lot of times,
sometimes it's hard to make a breakthrough
[SPEAKER_02]: with technology or a step back because of
the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that in cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same in every aspect of industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the regulations, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, that part needs to be settled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it needs to be settled with people
that know a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope in Slovenia, the regulation that
it's going to change is getting all the
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of the plant, not only the medical
aspect of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will think about also in a
regulative way how to use the stems,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves, whatever is left from the
plant that they are using for one medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Petra.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we entered, when we talked before the
panel, I told you that all the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: producers, which are a lot meanwhile in
Europe, South Africa, Canada, they throw
[SPEAKER_03]: away all the stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even that is ridiculous because we
have so many medical producers now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could use that as biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to pay for the destruction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of the regulations I do
not understand, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one's trash can be the other one's
treasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we would switch in mindset this kind
of thinking, we could get actually free
[SPEAKER_02]: construction material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would pay to get it as a,
people are now paying it as a waste,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a free material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to collect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to process it, which is not
even that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the same process machine that
is used for wood to make the shreds from
[SPEAKER_02]: wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not complicated process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the mindset that needs to be
changed.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis regulation is not only a
question of smoking weed, having medical
[SPEAKER_03]: weed, it's also a question of
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should not leave, or we should not
separate the cannabis plant into the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical, recreational cannabis plant and
the hemp plant, which does not make high,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's all the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in how far are you afraid,
Mark, when your government is regulating
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole cannabis thing, which they
announced now, that the hemp fiber thing
[SPEAKER_03]: falls a little bit out of the focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because we saw that reform is needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think it will be still in focus
or that will fall a little bit apart when
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is regulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Slovenia, we don't have focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do with the fiber or what can
we not to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we must go on that way from
construction material building material,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do everything what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only I can make something,
some prototypes, somebody make another
[SPEAKER_00]: prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we have something to show
you, then I think also the industry can
[SPEAKER_00]: see, okay, really big picture,
what can we do everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope that change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With everything, because in that time,
we don't have industry in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on under zero, not zero,
under zero, we are in the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, CBD is one of the parts,
we have it, but everything else is under
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my experience, I can say you
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the government legalizes medical
cannabis, all the companies from other
[SPEAKER_03]: countries will come in and support and
sponsor the medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They build it up for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to recreational cannabis,
same thing happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Companies from the countries where
cannabis is already legal come to your
[SPEAKER_03]: country and show you how to and want to
have a piece of the cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do not expect that will happen when it
comes to hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: No company will come and ask you,
oh, hemp is growing, hemp is legal,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's invest in your hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something you have to really get
cleared domestically.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be no sponsors to push your
hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the hemp industry is a very,
very important part of cannabis regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell your politics not to forget it,
please.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we are close to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was my final words.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we are open for questions now,
if there are any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right, we consider you all
perfectly well-educated then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time for the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That concludes today's Cannabis Science
and Technology B2B Forum here at the ICI.
[SPEAKER_01]: BC, the International Cannabis Business
Conference in Lake Bled, Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see you at the party tonight at 8
o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear your badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dress kind of warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right over there at the, that one.
Thank you all very much.
