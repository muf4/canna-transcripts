This is the International Candidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many people who came here kind of took
a chance, bought a ticket, wasn't sure
[SPEAKER_02]: what to expect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the feedback I'm getting is,
I can't believe this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know it was going to be this
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they mean by good is information and
networking and just the general attitude
[SPEAKER_02]: of the people here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to thank Alex and Anthony and
Gaio for putting on an event that really
[SPEAKER_03]: blends activism and business in a really,
really great way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The outreach has been phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: People from Brazil to Mexico, Texas,
the West Coast, let's see, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_04]: and other places in the country are here
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of nice people with a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the people kind of go,
oh, I hadn't thought about that before.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's raising a lot of consciousness about
the social repercussions of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure that everybody here came
in the door worrying about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But more like, oh, how can I make money or
how can I fit into the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear that they're being inculcated
with more and more progressive thought
[SPEAKER_06]: about why we're doing this, why we're
fighting to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening in this situation
right here is people are a bit overwhelmed
[SPEAKER_02]: by the breadth of the understanding that
people have for one another and empathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this might sound like some hoity-toity
stuff if you're just a businessman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm a businessman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do well in the industry, and I believe
in karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in love and understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually believe if you hold true to
some of those tenets and precepts that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're only going to benefit yourself for
so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my case, it's actually helped me
make money also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this new win-win situation that's
happening with the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what people are very
surprised about, that they can make money,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can be successful, and no one else
has to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fastest growing business in
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to thank Alex for bringing
the keynote speakers that he brought,
[SPEAKER_06]: the panels, Dr. Carl Hart and Ethan
Nittleman and Rick Steves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're celebrities.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get people in the door, but they're
saying really important things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Change happens when people get involved
and step forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come to conferences like this today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check, check, one, two.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Mgaio Bielam, N-G-A-I-O-420 on
Twitter, the culture editor of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuanapolitics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just wrapped it up here at the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a fantastic time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Blum from Celeb Stoner and Freedom
Leaf Magazine was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve DeAngelo was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Nittleman from the Drug Policy
Alliance gave an impassioned, impassioned
[SPEAKER_01]: speech about what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as all the suits jump into the
business, we got to remember to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: hippie ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always proceeded from the idea that
the hippies were right, and I try to let
[SPEAKER_01]: that guide my actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a great conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to OMMBC.com and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the question?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had an amazing weekend here at the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_02]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we started doing this,
when we had the concept to come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: the International Cannabis Business
Conference, of course, the business is in
[SPEAKER_02]: the title.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we wanted to do a whole ton of
advocacy, politics, and culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we were pushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were curious of how people would
react to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many other business conferences
out there that talk about investment
[SPEAKER_02]: banking or penny stocks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought if we did a business
conference that was not just focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: business, business, business, and money,
money, money, we thought we were actually
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a chance, and people might not
groove on it or not get what they expect
[SPEAKER_02]: for their high-end ticket price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's happened, in fact,
is people are actually overly excited and
[SPEAKER_02]: happy that we have decided to dedicate so
much of this to culture, politics,
[SPEAKER_02]: and advocacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm tremendously happy with the
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never doubt a small group of concerned
citizens can change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is indeed the only thing that ever has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a part of this with
me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
