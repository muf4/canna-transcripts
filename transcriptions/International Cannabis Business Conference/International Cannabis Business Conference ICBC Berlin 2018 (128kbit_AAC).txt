[SPEAKER_03]: Well, ICBC is all business, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it's about networking and organizing
a complete new market.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a group of potential
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Money is going to be involved very,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a good many of them are going to
do very well financially from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: legal for medical use, and eventually for
recreational use here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very exciting to see such a large
market open up for cannabis, especially,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, really leading the way for the
rest of the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is global.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is prohibition coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to be the cusp of a new
exciting industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look around here, everyone's
excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's very exciting to be a
part of that and to help educate people
[SPEAKER_00]: about us and about the industry and about
where we see it going.
[SPEAKER_05]: My idea that we have a totally different
approach to addiction in general,
[SPEAKER_05]: not only cannabis, that we really see it
as an illness and not of something
[SPEAKER_05]: criminal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very optimistic that we get this in
five or ten years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the key to this is just to try and
educate people, try to get experts from
[SPEAKER_04]: countries where this has already been on
the market for years, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are quite new to the cannabis scene and
for us it's a great way to connect with
[SPEAKER_06]: people and to find new business
opportunities because the scene is growing
[SPEAKER_06]: and growing but still quite small and it's
just a great way to get to know everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I speak at one of these
conferences, I beg these people when they
[SPEAKER_02]: open their shop to be encyclopedias of
information on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice little old lady comes in from the
grocery shopping into the cannabis shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her hands hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can no longer knit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a brochure about what a cannabinoid
could do for your arthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to explore that more,
come back and see us.
Thank you.
