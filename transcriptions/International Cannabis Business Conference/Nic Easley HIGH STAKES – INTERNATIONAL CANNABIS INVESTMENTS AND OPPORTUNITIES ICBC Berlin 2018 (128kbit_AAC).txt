[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for making it here this
beautiful morning where we brought
[SPEAKER_01]: Portland, Oregon's weather with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first speaker is going to talk about
some high stakes cannabis investment
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States Air Force taught the man
several languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's brought his drive, energy,
thirst for knowledge to the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_01]: over 15 years experience in the cannabis
commercial field.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helps cannabis businesses, investors
from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're serious about investing in
cannabis and you want to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's in the business for the
right reasons and is in it for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and will give you straight advice,
this is the man, the CEO of 3C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give a warm welcome for Mr. Nick
Easley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was hoping they'd have a little
something stronger up here for me this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate everyone's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To come from the United States to come and
share some of this information is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European Union has so many
opportunities right now that are barely
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a half a billion person
population without a legitimate bonafide
[SPEAKER_00]: program yet, you have so much room to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just prepared this this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday was really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going through cards last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to people from 17 countries last
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a normal conference, it's like,
oh, this state, this is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to see how many people have come
together for this industry is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me, Nick Easley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally a farm kid from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was in FFA and did agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right out of high school, essentially the
military recruited me to be a linguist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I speak a few languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, not German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish, a few indigenous languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was in the service for about four
years and got hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was 22, didn't really know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a biology degree and flipped a coin
and decided to go to Colorado for a ski
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was right after medical marijuana
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Colorado, as you know, is kind of like
the Amsterdam of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually kind of of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even Amsterdam's original program
was nothing like what happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the years from going from farming
the Midwest to military to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: right at that perfect moment, I've been
able to see how the industry has really
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from small medical producers that could
grow their own cannabis where there were
[SPEAKER_00]: no dispensaries, no commercial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Colorado, we were the first state
that ever really had to grow up as an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And licenses for cultivation and
manufacturing and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had to have a grow license in
order to have a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 2012 happened in Colorado where
essentially Proposition 64 was regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were the first state to legalize,
I don't like the word, but recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adult use, responsible use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it by regulating it like
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year in Colorado, we did $1.6 billion
in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just directly to cannabis
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't all the ancillary products and
services surrounding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, we now have Alaska,
Washington, Oregon, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada, Colorado, and soon to be
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: States that anyone who's 21 or older can
go and buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flour, vaporizers, suppositories,
infused adult lubricant products,
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about that potentiality
coming from medical, and even knowing this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very, very sacred medicinal plant,
and there is the business component with
[SPEAKER_00]: this, we're seeing time and time again,
so many companies that are starting and
[SPEAKER_00]: have these visions of making all this
money and helping the patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't have business acumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't put together their
companies correctly, or they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might know how to grow the plant,
or make a really good hash, or how to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a good dispensary for retail, but they
don't know business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having worked now with almost 200
different clients around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen time and time again what are
the telltale signs of a good company or a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of mention here,
I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a CPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a biologist, a farmer, and actually
now a venture fund manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I manage three venture funds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not giving legal advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not giving tax advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is purely business guidance here to
help your businesses, be it here
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally or in the states,
to start to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard because we always
consider there's like the US market and
[SPEAKER_00]: then everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've for years been considering this
to be a global empire that we're building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the United States,
you have to think about each state as an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't grow tomatoes in Oregon and bring
them to Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they're legal in Oregon and
they're legal in Washington, I can't cross
[SPEAKER_00]: that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, like having healthcare cover
cannabis, you know, having like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legal program of cannabis in
Canada where they're going to have adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use this summer, incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when people got all excited,
we're going to have all these dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: around Canada, no one remembered this
little thing called the LCBO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the largest liquor store in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's owned by the Canadian government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Canadian government really,
they made some interesting policies to
[SPEAKER_00]: where most of the provinces, they're going
to be running the cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of Canadian companies and LPs
thought, hey, we're going to do all these
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a lot of the places they wanted
to, they cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those rules and regulations are some of
the things that we're going to mention
[SPEAKER_00]: here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since I do raise copious amounts of
capital, I just have to, this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: general solicitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in the United States, so I don't
actually have to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always raising money, but this is
not, like I'm not offering securities
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you send me an email and we talk
for about 30 days, then we can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: offer securities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, in this industry,
my only problem from going from years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, do I have enough rainwater for my
tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have enough tomato crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I have enough like alfalfa for my
goats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like, do I have enough millions
and millions and millions of dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: invest into the right companies that are
scaling, taking market share that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have significant exits and
returns?
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing in my life is when I see
great portfolio companies and cannot raise
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly enough to satiate those
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are great companies out there in
the United States and internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the ability for international
investors to invest in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the United States investors to also
invest globally, not just through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian public market, which we're going
to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this is, I always want to
start with like what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry has countless examples of
what not to do, not paying your taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: not following safety standards,
using really bad pesticides and having
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls and violations over and over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our industry came from the gutter,
literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were in an illicit market and
people God bless them, the caregivers who
[SPEAKER_00]: would cultivate this plant illegally and
get it to patients who needed it for
[SPEAKER_00]: profit or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like those people, they care took this
plant and brought it forward for us to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to use for business now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's the purpose of using business
to make this plant better, more
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable, more sustainably produced,
safer and to create sustainable jobs and
[SPEAKER_00]: tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think of essentially the cannabis
industry, what we've seen in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States in those six adult use markets so
far is that alcohol sales have gone down
[SPEAKER_00]: 13.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, is marijuana better
than alcohol?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, a lot of people have
fixed incomes and like only so much money
[SPEAKER_00]: for fun money a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have like, let's say make 2000
euros a month and you have 500 extra euros
[SPEAKER_00]: a month for like fun, for beer,
for parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once cannabis is legal and you can
buy joints and you can buy vaporizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your limited amount of capital,
you're going to be buying less alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've seen also like opiate use,
like one of the worst, like more people
[SPEAKER_00]: die like in the United States of opiate
deaths than like all of Vietnam casually
[SPEAKER_00]: combined annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like opiates, like pharmaceutical
narcotics, like very, very addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some states in order to actually have
like medicinal cannabis, like you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have opiates in your system or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you actually have cannabis in your
system, like you can't actually get your
[SPEAKER_00]: pain medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're almost forcing people to use
these opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an endemic that no one really
talks about, but we're seeing that opiate
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths are going down almost 10% in states
that have legal medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's 31 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I counted, I think the United
States has 50 states, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus minus, but yeah, like 50 states,
31 is over 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means half of the states in least
have a medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six have adult use, seven with
Massachusetts coming and then eight with
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington DC, is also like legal for
adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since there's this little thing called
the Harris amendment and the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: capitals right there, they wouldn't pay
for like the roads and schools essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: if they opened up adult use stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, there's going to be three more
states on ballot initiatives that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have adult use cannabis soon to
be 20% of the United States, 21 or older.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own companies and in parts of companies
that we now in like Las Vegas have 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was at one at 317 in the morning
and there were still like 25 people
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is an amazing plant,
but if you don't do the business right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the right capital,
you cannot scale and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really one of the things I'm
going to mention here where you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: like down the line as an investor,
like what are market sectors doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the companies that are scaling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones are really taking market
position?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's a new market and based on their
population density, disposable income,
[SPEAKER_00]: like locations or for a medical marijuana
program, which are very, very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: you must know what the qualifying
conditions are in a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: state or country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for an example, if they don't have pain
or PTSD as qualifying conditions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, that's almost 92% of all
medical cards that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means if a state only allows like
glaucoma, MS, cancer, AIDS, like I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have 8% of the potential clients and
clients, well patients, but then my
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are my clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: My clients are my revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: My revenue is my business and my business
serves patients and clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can only have 8% of that or in
some states like 0.2% of that population,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in Minnesota, only a few conditions,
New York, Florida, it's not going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: robust market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an investor, I found I cannot
invest into medical marijuana programs
[SPEAKER_00]: unless I have enough qualifying conditions
that will support the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I know long term the legislation is
going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've also found for all of you in
this room, if you're in this business,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're an advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a massive responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for this plant, for the plant that
like past generations like brought forward
[SPEAKER_00]: for us for tens of thousands of years,
breeding like hemp, hump, like that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Great Dane of the dog world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like poodles, you know,
like little itty bitty dogs, that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bred them for certain reasons,
just like apples or tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what would happen if you took a
bulldog and a shih tzu and like made a
[SPEAKER_00]: baby?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some bullshit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where like if you took a hemp
plant and like a really good cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that this one's way low THC,
this one's way high THC, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get something in the middle and then it's
no longer legally hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diversification of the genetics
pool, like Gregor Mendel stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: like back here, the genetics are so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to have a kid who's
Michael Jordan, but they're like four feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, you can buy him the best shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them in the best basketball
camps, but they're never going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make the best business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the best team, the best market,
but you have bad genetics equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be Michael Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've really liked to look at like what
have other companies done that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an investor, maybe 20% of the time
I'm interested in past companies because
[SPEAKER_00]: past companies in the U S probably didn't
structure correctly, have all these past
[SPEAKER_00]: liabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a company, you buy all the
baggage, like the assets, all the past
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, all the past lawsuits,
those then come and transfer to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that we're going to mention
that's so important like from the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: world is called like, I call it DD,
but like due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you do diligence on a market
that barely has any data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I own one of the data companies based
out of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Platts McGraw Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the price of corn today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it going to be tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does it cost to grow corn?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cost going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what we've seen with cannabis in
these states that allow multiple licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just like Germany's original 10 or
Arkansas's five, when you can have Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, California, Colorado,
Michigan, these states that have 500,
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand cultivation licenses,
there's lots of competition and
[SPEAKER_00]: competition is good in business,
but also competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on the downside of it,
it will crush you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's costing you $800 a pound to
produce indoors in like a 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a four acre greenhouse
producing cannabis for less than a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars a pound all in, compliantly that's
higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't call it organic in the United
States because that's a federal term
[SPEAKER_00]: that's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be a little careful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this moment that when you have
the opportunity to come in and make a new
[SPEAKER_00]: company and do everything right,
good lawyers, good consulting,
[SPEAKER_00]: good capital, like you have a strong shot
there, but you have to insulate yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: from that downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if you guys are going to
know this one, but if you do, you can call
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone familiar with like Kenny Loggins,
like Top Gun, Highway to the Danger Zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like my analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this industry, it's like this is a
fucking danger zone and there are patients
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering and there are horrible things
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the products that people are
buying and selling like are very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the cannabis that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the pesticides they're spraying on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 22 pounds of coal per gram of
cannabis indoors that it takes of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity to produce one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every single light, a thousand watt
light bulb, if it takes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Energy says about 2.2 pounds
of coal per hour to make one kilowatt of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every thousand watt light, five feet by
five feet is two pounds of coal an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours a day for the photo period,
you're like, wow, that's like almost 30
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of coal a day for one light for
like one plant, four plants, 12 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how big they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the environmental part is so huge on
this, but from a business standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's huge capital expenditures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your operational expenditures are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that's really unique about
this industry that this is the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the history of business that doing the
right thing, like environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: producing in greenhouses when you can,
not just doing hydroponic with salt-based
[SPEAKER_00]: derivatives or bad pesticides because you
designed your growing properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you actually make more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you pay your workers well,
you design your facilities well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you invest and you take the capital that
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this danger zone, like in the United
States, it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I do is federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But state by state, like we have this
thing called states rights, each state can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of make their own laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the states in the United
States have gone like this to the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for patients initially, every single
marketplace in the United States started
[SPEAKER_00]: as medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the six have seven, soon to be
eight, have transitioned then to adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: and still have medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And medical has like low taxes,
just normal sales tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then adult use has all of these excise
taxes, sometimes almost 40%, like 11% for
[SPEAKER_00]: the state, 20% for the city and the town,
all the little donations, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day, adult use,
you go to buy a joint, you're like $18.50
[SPEAKER_00]: or like $27, but then a medical joint
might be $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each state's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this danger zone that we're gonna talk
about, you know, Kenny Loggins,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, watch Top Gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll get the references there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in the United States,
we've got like Jeff Sessions, our angry
[SPEAKER_00]: little like troll or like Keebler elf they
call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we used to have this thing called the
Cole Memorandum that said if states follow
[SPEAKER_00]: eight specific rules, they can essentially
have a medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have this Omnibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, they brought Dana here from
California, one of our great Senator
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and Earl, another one from Oregon,
which thanks Oregon people, they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bill that prevents the federal government
from spending federal funds to prosecute
[SPEAKER_00]: state medical marijuana programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I as an investor or an operator,
I don't have a single sentence of
[SPEAKER_00]: protection for recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recreational marijuana will be legal
here in Germany someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give it five to 11, 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not a matter of like if this is
gonna happen, it's a matter of when.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's more and more medical
research, efficacy, and something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really unique to governments is tax
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like my expression here, and if you're
in the gubernatorial space I regards,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like tax revenue is heroin to a
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like people that get hooked on opiates
or like heroin, they will steal their
[SPEAKER_00]: mama's TV and pawn it to buy more drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do anything they can to protect
their tax revenue because that's their
[SPEAKER_00]: lifeblood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colorado, we've, of that $1.6
billion last year, we did half a billion
[SPEAKER_00]: with a B in new tax revenue in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: For new jobs, hands-on jobs, we have about
68,000 badge like licensed employees to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you think about all the plumbers,
electricians, carpenters, lawyers,
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants, marketers, branders,
on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Velocity of capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dollar in cannabis spent is $7.1 of
additional capital created.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest velocity as, you know,
capitalists we've actually ever seen and
[SPEAKER_00]: tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, like trying to navigate
this space, in order to get a license
[SPEAKER_00]: every single place, you have to have real
estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that real estate typically can't be
too close to churches, schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: parks, daycares, addiction centers,
all these weird requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be zoned correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it has to be industrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they say it has to be in this little
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a business park compared to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have real estate,
you don't have shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that to make everyone understand
that real estate is half of this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pay off real estate in about three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys normally pay off real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a mortgage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mortgage, the definition, is until death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you can pay off real estate in
three years, something's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're finding your real estate
and choosing that space, like that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: place you're going to plant your license
flag and be able to actually apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these license applications,
be it in Germany, be it in Denmark,
[SPEAKER_00]: be it in Jamaica, be it in LPs in Canada,
be it in the states, they're all different
[SPEAKER_00]: and have very specific requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're complex, convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's a lot of corruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the government will rescind and
take back all the licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that now in two states,
three countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the new states and governments
are getting a little bit more cautious,
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing there's this little thing called
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And litigation, like back in the day,
was like, now litigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to insulate and protect
yourself from that downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I say find good lawyers to
structure your contracts, structure your
[SPEAKER_00]: deals, and follow their guidance most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're a little too willy nilly
and like, oh, don't take risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to take risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't take risks, you're not
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And navigating this space, anything
outside of like having the right amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: money, having your right application,
having the right real estate, that's this
[SPEAKER_00]: one little place that's not the danger
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still the danger zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a country like Germany or Denmark or
Canada, when it's federally legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: the danger zone is not as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we've learned that real estate
is not growing cannabis or manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate is separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building, separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights, the fertigation, the tables,
the trays, the TVs, and the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: the counters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not growing selling marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you'll have a property management
company that buys all of those hard assets
[SPEAKER_00]: and insulates them in a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, good or bad,
we have this little thing from the Supreme
[SPEAKER_00]: Court called Citizens United.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pretty much means that like a GmbH or
an LLC or an APS, a company is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people in the United States have like
these things like these unalienable
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like freedom of speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why like companies can make massive
donations to political campaigns as an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also like able to like insulate
different people doing different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have one person, one entity,
one company that owns the real estate,
[SPEAKER_00]: owns the lights, does all the buildup,
the electricity, everything other than
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, nutrients, the paper for receipts in
a dispensary count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything other than the cannabis
itself or directly used to cultivate,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture, or sell it is then leased to
the company, the LLC that actually has the
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that company has a problem,
they can't seize my assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I charge very high lease
payments, very high rent, and suck a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of capital out of that company making tons
of money into a company that's not subject
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same taxes legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your corporate veil is critical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find good lawyers to do this, good
accountants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do this, you realize that 70%
of the money you need as an operator isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even cannabis money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in our world, banks,
institutional capital will not make those
[SPEAKER_00]: investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing these structures, even in
Germany, even in any country, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: know the rules to play the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to get into this space
and you want to get into Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get into Colombia,
you want to get into India, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules governing the place?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is their current policy laws and
ordinances?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long is it going to take for some
of those things to change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a significant business
interest there or would like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you take this little thing called a
lever out and actually apply force and
[SPEAKER_00]: leverage to actually make that program
legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a business owner,
remember I said this is not just
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, it's responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the nonprofit organizations in the
United States, drug policy alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana policy project, Americans for
Safe Access, great nonprofits that help to
[SPEAKER_00]: get medical marijuana legalized,
you have to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to donate because the reason that
you're here today is actually because
[SPEAKER_00]: those groups did their job and got more
and more legal, more and more businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got to stay out of the danger zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor guy the other day had a little
problem in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know who this is, you know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this funny show called Silicon
Valley on HBO and it's like about startup
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and like soon to be Facebook's
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this character and he has this
little incubator and we always say we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the unicorn, like investment,
this magical, mythical thing that like no
[SPEAKER_00]: one's seen, the Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as Multiverse Capital or Sequoia
Capital, I try to find unicorns and I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to find a baby unicorn in the forest that
no one's found yet and feed that unicorn
[SPEAKER_00]: the best food and like make it the best
unicorn in the world because out of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies, if you have something
that's like no one cares about a million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, but like you do start to care
when it gets to a billion or beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at Zuckerberg, like last
week all that's happening, 33 year old
[SPEAKER_00]: just sitting in front of like Senate House
committees defending something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much every single one of them use,
their grandkids use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you start a company,
you're thinking about exit and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know about exit strategy,
you don't need to have a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just I'm going to start a company
and do this for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it gets hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these pressures and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to sell your company?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get more investment
into the company?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be cleaning the toilets
every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I cleaned some toilets in an
office in Colorado last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I came in, there was a
meeting, there's a dirty toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a CEO, sometimes you do that,
but you don't want to do that forever and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you hire good people in scale
and eventually sell your business or your
[SPEAKER_00]: business goes public or you do an M&A like
a merger and acquisition, which even
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier we were mentioning how mergers and
acquisitions are kind of like M&A,
[SPEAKER_00]: like mixed martial arts fighting,
like those cage fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you do a merger acquisitions
like that, but we're always looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: the unicorn, but the problem in that
everyone thinks they're a unicorn and the
[SPEAKER_00]: realistic truth is 99% of them are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually 99.9% of them are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make an investment into a
company as an investor, this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That company has a 99% chance of failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, today or this month, I had four
companies that turned one turn five,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple more turn four, a couple more
turn three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun when you get past that
five year mark or a three year mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you'd have a significant investment
come in, but it's not just like money's
[SPEAKER_00]: flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in order to be a unicorn,
it takes the structuring unique
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive advantage in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the things I look at when I'm creating
a company or I'm evaluating like an
[SPEAKER_00]: investment opportunity, anything from
$20,000 to $25 million is the space that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've worked in for size and investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always thinking like, what's the
market risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what happens if the state or the
country takes away the licenses or the
[SPEAKER_00]: market changes and we can't make certain
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the product risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making vaporizers and you use
glycol or flavor additives or it has
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and it gets a recall,
the brand damage will crush you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what are the risks
associated with this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cannabis, drugged driving,
like there's all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, there was a really
unfortunate case of like a college student
[SPEAKER_00]: committed suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had eaten a lot of edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day in Colorado,
you could sell like a thousand milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate bar, like of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like California, like all these huge
things, these Kiva bars that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, when it's the first time
trying a product, it's our responsibility
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide them a quality experience
because I'm not selling products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling the experience that those
products are going to induce in my
[SPEAKER_00]: clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that experience needs to be enjoyable
from the moment they see my logo,
[SPEAKER_00]: walk into a store, like how they're
treated in the store, how they see our
[SPEAKER_00]: website, like that experience from how the
product is, how they feel the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have a responsibility to
your patients, to your clients,
[SPEAKER_00]: to create high quality products and not
have risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one is team risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, you can have the
best financials in the world, the best
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property, patents on all this
cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end of the day, I'm giving my money to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why like investors at the end
of the day, they're giving their money to
[SPEAKER_00]: us by doing due diligence to then invest
into the companies that we know that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your team is not strong,
if you're an individual and you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, you're not in risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not investible because it's not
protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a great idea, like you need to
bring in like a CFO financial person and
[SPEAKER_00]: an operational person, good legal,
good people to actually execute on that
[SPEAKER_00]: vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always analyze teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in this, how do you actually
become gravity and bring other people
[SPEAKER_00]: towards you?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a good cannabis grower,
like, you know, that idea like master
[SPEAKER_00]: grower doesn't mean master business
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're great at growing cannabis,
but you don't know business, you'd better
[SPEAKER_00]: find some business help because like
master grower, master fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single business that's been
cultivation that has had horrible failures
[SPEAKER_00]: were run by a master grower and God bless
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't maybe go to Wharton.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't go to Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have business classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand LLCs, deductions,
depreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not using banks,
which there are banks in the U S that bank
[SPEAKER_00]: for us, you have so much risk and
liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get good people as part of
your team is something that's always
[SPEAKER_00]: really critical to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so from a, as IS and then
like, I wanted to talk a little bit today
[SPEAKER_00]: about like anti anti fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm looking at investments or
market, something that's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different that I want you to think about
is, um, fragility, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: an IS and then like, if I were to take my
phone and pour water on it, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's robust, if it's strong
enough, like I could pour water on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's anti fragile, if I hit this
with a hammer and throw it down the
[SPEAKER_00]: stairs, it gets stronger and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the market, like I deal with a lot
with public companies and private
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and looking at like what wall
street traders did back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: or now even shorting companies,
knowing there's a bad company,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we do market regulation through
investment to if there's a bad company,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can short stocks, like borrow stocks,
short their stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know something's going to go bad,
it crushes those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you bet wrong, like you'll actually
get crushed and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, be very careful if you play in
that space, like I've had great days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then there's some days you're like,
I wish I didn't wake up this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the next day, if the news comes
out, then it's good again, but you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to maintain that pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to find a place to where it's
like you're anti fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the market changes, it doesn't crush
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have options against some of your
hedge bets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, 99% of companies fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And biologically, like E.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson, he said like 99.9% of all species
that have ever lived are extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we're kind of here in this like
present moment, like the dinosaurs,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than like when big meteor hit about
70 million years ago, like we got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: dinosaurs left, like birds and a few of
those, but most of them just died off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here like mammals, all these
things have evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a massive thing happens, how do you
know that you're not going to be affected?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an investment into one
company, and there's trouble, you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why like I invest into portfolio
companies, lots and lots of companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: pass our due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spread that out amongst them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I diversify risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to do due diligence on each
and every investment opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
the worst thing that you can lose is
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got one time, one life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for like giving me about 30,
40 minutes to like share some of my things
[SPEAKER_00]: with you with your life so you can do
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you don't want to waste your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is the only thing like we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the present, like a gift,
Christmas, like at the present moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you going to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this industry is like once in a
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dot com boom that happened is very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian companies with valuations of
$100, 250 to 250 X revenue is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you look at certain things,
there's good things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go public, you have a press release,
you make $100 million in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love a day I can just raise $100
million as a private fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like there are advantages to being
public, but there's downside too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be very, very insulated
from risk if you are going to have some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can see it's like on certain
curves, like when things are going up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're going down, like that's what
crushes companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you insulate from risk so that if
there is a bad day, it doesn't crush you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like your other companies do well,
or if it's bad for this company,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually good for your other
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why I like Nin is like he was an
investment banker and like stock trader
[SPEAKER_00]: for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went into philosophy and then
started to realize the philosophy of
[SPEAKER_00]: investing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really one of his best messages is
like on being anti fragile, like be anti
[SPEAKER_00]: fragile or die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're just one company,
you have to insulate yourself from all
[SPEAKER_00]: those risks from like your team quitting
on you from your product, like getting
[SPEAKER_00]: recalls or like causing problems or not
having enough capital or the market
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't go into all markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's good, why not go into a few
markets at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then if one fails, you're still
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we diversified out of the
United States four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, well, if the whole
federal government goes bad, I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide liquidity to my investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have more diverse markets
and there's more diverse opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant needs to be legal
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just at the end of the day,
this is a very sacred medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was homeschooled by a bot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just such a special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not ours like we're holding it
for future generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the businesses we're creating today
will be like the Pepsi's and the Coca
[SPEAKER_00]: Cola's of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everyone's going to get to be that
but everyone thinks they're going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really and I put all the puppies in
here just because some of some of my talks
[SPEAKER_00]: are down or so I just wanted to keep
everybody like happy like with pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: puppies.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've seen Shark Tank,
you've seen some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these little companies just
getting crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every day, I mean, probably a
week, I'm going through probably 20 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: investments a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe two to three of those move over
to a pile that I might look and then push
[SPEAKER_00]: to my investment committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's easy to see when you've had the
experience with hundreds of companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, what's good and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, it all comes
down to the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if the market's crap,
a good team can change a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to scale like what's that
exit?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to plan this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get liquidity for
your investors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to make money yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
it's not just about the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like the money is nice, but you got to
use the money to build the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And constantly like on this one,
just like the Indian philosophy of like
[SPEAKER_00]: keep every dollar in your company for 1000
days, you must keep doing that keep
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvesting reinvesting, this is not going
to slow down or stop anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want big impact, you want big
profits, don't suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one rule, like pretty much and the
number one rule with me and my investors
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, don't lose investors money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, see rule number one,
like that's the number one thing you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to like piss off investors
because they actually have backing and
[SPEAKER_00]: will come after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write good operating agreements like write
good contracts, very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about a little plant and
like just, you know, seeing the Denmark
[SPEAKER_00]: world is like you see a little plant and
then now it's turning into pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: products like everything that we know in
the United States that's medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational will merge into one thing
someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this other thing that's
called like pharmacy, like big pharma,
[SPEAKER_00]: like IP, like specific titration,
medical research, like body mass index to
[SPEAKER_00]: where this product does this almost every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value in those like I've diversified
into a lot of investments on that side,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be more and more and more
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually in the US, cannabis will
probably be under like the ATF,
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, tobacco, firearms, cannabis,
all the fun things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a surfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like skipped a meeting right
before my flight to go surfing because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some good swell in Malibu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live really close to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, this is a place called Ring
Cone and you see all those little dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this amazing point break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a wave's coming in, it's just
like everyone's trying to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to catch that really
fucking amazing once in a lifetime wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't catch it here on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't catch it on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 10 other guys paddling for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know where to position yourself
for when to catch it, how to paddle and
[SPEAKER_00]: then when to pop up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that analogy of like in investing,
there's lots of waves and some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can see it sometimes like that's
just going to be like a closeout and just
[SPEAKER_00]: crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times it's really big here and
you're like, if I catch it right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can ride it all the way to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all waves too, you got to know when to
exit and get off the wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of my favorite little Topanga
point, like you ride a wave too early,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets so shallow and then you like fall
and like break yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you got to know when to exit
the wave too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like at risk, you can't just get
knocked out with like a surfboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fins, like it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like how do you catch a wave?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you choose a company?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you choose an investment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes from like sitting on your
board and like watching out there or like
[SPEAKER_00]: us with our data companies and analysts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got homies up on the shore with like
magnifying glasses, like looking out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ocean, like, Hey, there's a good wave
coming in like 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone else sees the little ones close
to them and they like go for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sitting there waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not wasting my time on these crap
little waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm waiting for those good ones,
but I like to like catch a good one exit
[SPEAKER_00]: and more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with more and more investors,
we catch more and more waves and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from Colorado, that's where I
got into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love backcountry, like snow
snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously being a CEO now, I don't have
as much time, but it used to take me
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes five hours to skin and climb up
a whole mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking like a ski resort with
like the chairs, like I was a backcountry
[SPEAKER_00]: instructor, avalanche instructor,
mountain guide, and would take clients
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then for myself, like we would climb
these mountains and then just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh powder turns are I mean,
it's like better than sex, drugs and rock
[SPEAKER_00]: and roll combined, like better than
surfing even because it's like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: riding a whole mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Louie, Doug and I,
it's like when you get those first tracks,
[SPEAKER_00]: those good investments, it's great,
but you got to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really dangerous avalanche
conditions, I don't go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know I die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a company, you also know
you're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what are the days that are
good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do your research, do your homework,
do your due diligence, find good people,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at all of the other failures that
everyone's doing and realize like what not
[SPEAKER_00]: to do like and always be crushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about crushing like every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done this, you know, almost like
13, 14 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not stopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not about like do this for a
few more years and then like retire or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, go get a job selling cars
or something like this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in here and like you're not
90 and you're not like 18 or like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in this room, I think you
realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not about if you grow cannabis or
know anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do in your past business
life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a pharmacist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you an investor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a marketer?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you take those past industry skills
and like leverage it to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis needs marketing,
cannabis needs real estate, cannabis needs
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those things, compliance,
directives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a guy five years ago in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ran a trash company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Nick, how do I get into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I have all these producers that
have all of this like plant material and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to shred it with plant shredders
and kitty litter and soil and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: unrecognizable before they put it in the
garbage, a locked dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe come up with a company where
you have these little bins and like pick
[SPEAKER_00]: them up and like you do all the shredding
and just take away the risk and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have rotting plant material sitting
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's now doing like four or five
million dollars a year doing garbage for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry and just shredding
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's thinking about scaling that
and licensing that to other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's an idea for everything in the
space, but you have to like know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: execute on those because like everyone
wants to jump into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you got to look before you jump
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see tons of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, we're going to do this
and go for a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we're going to start a new
dispensary in downtown Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were tons of them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't get a 5,000 square foot
grow in Colorado anymore or Oregon anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: or California anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have to know what timing and
which market, just like which mountain to
[SPEAKER_00]: climb, which wave to catch, which company
to start and which ones just to like
[SPEAKER_00]: realize are more of a risk and a liability
than an actual asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we all want to jump and have fun
together and you always have that one
[SPEAKER_00]: friend or that one company that sucks and
like you like laugh and giggle at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we're all in this together and
it's such a big market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I hate other investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate other consulting companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate other data companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, a lot of my competitors, I actually buy
their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes a position for me is
like too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, who else am I going to go to
like piggyback and work together on
[SPEAKER_00]: projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whenever you look at a society that
had collaboration versus competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: they last three times longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing actually with matrilineal
societies, female societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never have to question who the mother
of a child is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes a lot more sense if you keep the
mother's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also last three times longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have intergenerational
connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're thinking about things
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some cultures, the men got to choose
if they got to go to war, but the women
[SPEAKER_00]: got to choose if they got to bring
weapons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little off topic there, but diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I've gotten 26 states so far,
11 countries where I've been active,
[SPEAKER_00]: still active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I talked to 17 countries
yesterday and some of them it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know your laws and program and
it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others it's like, there's not even
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others it's like, oh, you're one of those
four license holders in that country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what stage of this are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we design, we do every step of
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good teams, like you got to find those
good lawyers, those good investors,
[SPEAKER_00]: those good consultants to help you with
your part of the piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like if there's great partnership
potential, look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like build a company for yourself
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And learn from markets, like each
individual market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you see like all the different
dots where, you know, this is like within
[SPEAKER_00]: the last year I've been to every one of
those dots there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a couple of offices in the
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't talk about the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not like, is this going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually, you've kind of missed the
boat on a few markets already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are more and more markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States is small in population
compared to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't even, they gave me a laser
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about it to use it,
but I never did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can amuse a cat later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, I really appreciate the time
to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of this is challenging to
hear, but like when you fight the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: you lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this all comes from real world
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if any time or not,
but we'll be around all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you all the best of luck and success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, do this for the patients,
but do it with the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you can help more patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Easley, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Easley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always be crushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
