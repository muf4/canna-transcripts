[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so just a disclaimer before I start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an investment banker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a managing director of venture funds
and private equity funds in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just purely business consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what our other company does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a disclaimer side, always find
good lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good examples for those that know
cannabis, international regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: business, finance, and for accounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some of the best billion dollar
companies in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck up major things because they didn't
understand tax treaties, withholdings,
[SPEAKER_00]: implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is cannabis we're going to talk
about, but also know that the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: business structures are most likely going
to be the keys to success or failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also may offend your country or your
city or your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing personal, but just from what
we've seen in the industry for over 13
[SPEAKER_00]: years, you just kind of have to tell it
how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also swear sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apologies in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit about my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally from Wisconsin, small farm
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never thought I would go from farming in
Wisconsin to cannabis agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially after high school,
I was in the United States Air Force,
[SPEAKER_00]: got hurt, flipped a coin, went to Colorado
and started a small cannabis consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: company right when medical cannabis was
changing from cards on the wall to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something very important about
Colorado is we were the first program in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world that commercialized medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also the first place in the world
that legalized recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: better than anything Amsterdam ever could
talk about or Spanish clubs like 21 or
[SPEAKER_00]: older standardized products, tested taxes,
six plus billion dollars in revenue for a
[SPEAKER_00]: six million person state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Washington and California and
Oregon and Alaska and Nevada and now
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts and Maine, another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at nine states in D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like 10 places out of 50 with
recreational cannabis in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked in 30 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've won licenses in 24 states to like
start these businesses, medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely knew the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started international in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing LP work in Canada and then those
first German Tinders and then two of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 Danish licenses on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the U.S., we got a really good
understanding of what not to do state by
[SPEAKER_00]: state by state and then internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equally have learned what programs work,
what programs don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a good investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always looking at this from the main
focus of agriculture, business
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing and distribution and
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every company that talks about brands that
doesn't understand distribution in their
[SPEAKER_00]: state, in their country or how Aramax
might work with international
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why build a brand one if it sucks and your
product sucks and you have no way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it to market or like in California right
now, there's so many companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: paying for shelf space and have
distribution licenses and lock out the
[SPEAKER_00]: small producers from being able to get
their products to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's very different than like
Germany and having an import license,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharma distribution license, pharmacies
and actually having doctors with
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always remember the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: International is another and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quasi medical kind of adult international
is medical pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to always keep that in mind,
even though we all know that recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is going to be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere or in most places, it's like
when and not so much an if, but every
[SPEAKER_00]: single time in the United States,
there was a medical program that
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioned to recreational 100 percent
of the time medical licenses and companies
[SPEAKER_00]: had first right of refusal or preference
to get into those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're doing international
pharmaceutical and medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: development, also know if 100 percent of
the time in other places, this has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to rain true,
just like it did in Canada and similar
[SPEAKER_00]: with Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a global side, you know,
we started like that little kind of blue
[SPEAKER_00]: state in the middle there in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having done cannabis industry for 13
years and seeing like those new states or
[SPEAKER_00]: a new country, look at Germany's first
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're going to have licenses for
200 kilos a year each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like and then they realize they're like,
oh, shit, this was this crazy program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to mail stuff from bond partners
madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, we're going to take all
those back and do another program like
[SPEAKER_00]: every program is a guinea pig market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do we test for pesticides or what's
the tax rate that we have for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every program is a new example of what not
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as many I recognize, lots of good
companies here and new people starting
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know what not to do in these
other markets and don't repeat the same
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes of other past markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you see, it's starting in every
continent other than Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still like anyone who has a research
license in Antarctica, like we want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like seven continents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we're around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: With medical cannabis, but how it started
in California with compassionate care like
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996, how that's transitioned in the
United States to have 44 states in one way
[SPEAKER_00]: or another out of 50 have some sort of
cannabis program, 31 medical states.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like our government can't like go
after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about what we did in the
United States, some of the examples will
[SPEAKER_00]: go over for Canada and what's happening in
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very indicative of other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you look at, like after
prohibition in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: when alcohol was illegal and made legal,
what happened in those five, 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: after that moment happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pharmaceutical international,
like drug discovery, drug development,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge opportunity like tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not every single country is going to
be growing tobacco in a warehouse to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco in that country or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we grow things agriculturally,
we import, we export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the market's starting to allow
that and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem in the US, though,
like even being a veteran, loving my
[SPEAKER_00]: country, like what I do in America is
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every single thing we do is federally
illegal, aiding a bedding manufacturer of
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much a schedule one narcotic
heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go state by state, every single
state is almost like a new country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about like kind of the EU and
there's different little regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but we have no interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't grow cannabis in Colorado and
then ship that to another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always like, right now with all
the companies that you're hearing about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always based on the licenses in those
states where you have to have like local
[SPEAKER_00]: county control and then state control and
like Department of Health, Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture, new rules in each
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And internationally is the exact same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every country might have their own
policies, regulations, what can be
[SPEAKER_00]: imported, what can be sold, who can do it,
how many licenses there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And license number determines business
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about states like Colorado,
Washington, Oregon, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: unlimited licenses if you get municipal
approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado over a thousand cultivation
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, 1300.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think like Portugal, there's three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very different from a competition
basis of how much you can grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: what products, like our vaporizers are
allowed, our edibles allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states won't allow flour,
just oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states just flour and no edible
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states no beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states no refrigerated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to know the individual market
dynamics of a production country or state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have lots of licenses in
places like that, the price per pound or
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say like half a kilo, like a pound
was like $4,400 U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Colorado, that's around six,
seven, 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of licenses, greenhouses lowering the
cost of production, outdoor allowed,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it's still there, but the cost of
production, you have to know each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's costing you four times more to
grow a gram than let's say greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: compliantly, as the market drops,
there's a certain point that if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable, we said in 2010, if you're not
profitable at $500 a pound, like a market
[SPEAKER_00]: price, you're already going out of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the only time that some of these
states matter when you just have just a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation license or an extraction
license or both is when you're making that
[SPEAKER_00]: additional value add of like growing
cannabis, extracting oils, making products
[SPEAKER_00]: and making standardized brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, brands are a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them aren't that quality,
but it's really hard to brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say a certain type of apple compared
to like an applesauce company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this transition of standardizing
with brands, but brands in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada, very different than brands
internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brands internationally actually don't
matter when it comes to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does matter is quality and your
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you meet the quality standard and
you're the lowest price, you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: generic practical in the whole country,
especially if you have distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the examples from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: are very, very helpful, but they're also a
hindrance if you're trying to copy the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States model or the Canadian model
for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two are flawed programs in how they
operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with like Portuguese companies,
Swiss CBD companies, German companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Danish companies, it's starting to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where you are matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every license in every state is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cultivators in Alaska way up north
with greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their price per pound is like thirty five
hundred a pound still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like their cost of production is just
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the United States legalizes
medical, which will happen first,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we'll see some like international
policies kind of start to transform and
[SPEAKER_00]: like interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: When recreational happens in the United
States, all those grow houses built in
[SPEAKER_00]: downtown Las Vegas are going to be
obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you think like Las Vegas, like
partisan city, that county, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't allow any flower grown outside of
that county to be sold in Clark County
[SPEAKER_00]: originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you had to build a building in the
middle of the desert to grow a weed very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very expensively in a concrete building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that way, only if the state
doesn't allow greenhouse or outdoor and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just like plastic in red or like
plastic greenhouses, but like glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can do that for commercial
production, for control, it's the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a long term relevant company,
especially if you're doing oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're I mean, look at Tweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at some of these other companies like
when Canopy is considering exiting all of
[SPEAKER_00]: their production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason because there's some
changes happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think about all these new states,
all these new companies, all these new
[SPEAKER_00]: countries with policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons and tons of startup
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with over five hundred just
with our consulting company over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's lots of startup companies
in a startup industry, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: copious amounts of failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an investor, when I'm managing other
investors, capital, our own capital,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you choose where you invest your time
and money is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just think first, like cannabis is all
sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this new thing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business dynamics are more important than
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can train cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production, the extraction,
the distribution, the science,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not a good team, if it's in
the wrong market, if there's major product
[SPEAKER_00]: risk for like wrongful deaths and things
like that, like that's all liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about a company and
how you're going to scale that company to
[SPEAKER_00]: get like a return on your investment,
if there's those risk or it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: right team or the wrong market,
why even invest there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just like dot coms, like there
were so many that started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how many turned into Google?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many of the ride share programs
turned into Uber and their IPO aside from
[SPEAKER_00]: that little kind of thing that happened
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to actually make a
big, big company with value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's those early warning signs
or they don't have good business dynamics,
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, right now, even,
you know, let's say about a billion under
[SPEAKER_00]: management of like certain sorts of
projects, the amount of capital we've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted on garbage companies, well over 10
billion, not just in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at some countries like we'll get
into Denmark, for example, all the startup
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are those 11 that got licenses,
which we helped with two of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold one because it's like,
why do you want to produce in Denmark?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a 32 hour work week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their taxes are high as hell and it's cold
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than like that one part of the year,
not a good place to grow agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: production for like international export,
but it was the third country in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: that had a pilot program to allow export.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's value in being in a market
sometimes, but not maybe putting all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your positions and staying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you don't scale and change
and adapt, like the market changes every
[SPEAKER_00]: day, new operators, new countries,
new potential threats, UN, like Interpol,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all these different regulations
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not very, very agile,
you will get broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the difference from going to
start up like series a series B to like
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like a public exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're thinking about like normal
investing in this, if it's your time,
[SPEAKER_00]: your money or your company, cover your ass
for the normal basis, like think normal
[SPEAKER_00]: business cannabis aside and then
specialize the business model for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the business doesn't make sense,
it's not going to make anything just
[SPEAKER_00]: because cannabis might be three,
four thousand euros a kilo doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's going to be the case forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or back in the day, it was like when you
had a problem, you throw money at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have lots of competition and
the prices are coming down and standards
[SPEAKER_00]: are going up, there's this moment of
breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen hundreds and hundreds of
companies go out of business in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's more and more every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But focus on the normal business dynamics,
just like a normal investment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then understand the cannabis part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you just think cannabis will
carry you, it will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so like when I think about actually
like the risk of this, everything about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, like number one is we are a
compliance industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love like we are a compliance
industry through being compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the privilege of cultivating,
manufacturing and distributing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not compliant, if you don't
know the rules in that market or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start some like Swiss CBD company
and then you're going to you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be selling to Germany and you're going to
sell to the United States, like what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules you have to do to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you don't know what those rules
are and have good lawyers and actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: this correctly, you won't make any sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's no revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your your time is wasted,
your investors capital is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the normal risk for this, it's knowing
the rules and compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you focus on that, every company
that we've gotten to like a billion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: type valuation has always had compliance
at the forefront of everything over their
[SPEAKER_00]: logo, over their like wellness concept,
whatever special thing they might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's compliance first, just like a normal
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compliance, tax and legal, then what's
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not good on those basis,
we won't even go to the second page in a
[SPEAKER_00]: deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medical, when you think
internationally, we used medical in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States to get cannabis legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm on the board of directors for
Americans for Safe Access disabled
[SPEAKER_00]: veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was a patient in Colorado in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, everything is like medical
focus, but it wasn't medical in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doctors making prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a recommendation, but then
through that, we it allowed these medical
[SPEAKER_00]: programs to start to get medicine to
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But internationally, it's not just use
medical to get rec legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be legal, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very, very medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just beginning to understand so much
more of what we've kept around for
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of years for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have been willing to break the
law forever about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking cows are hilarious right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like childhood here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't have a medical approach
and what your focus is internationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there's like we'll talk about a
little bit about the International
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotics Control Board, kind of a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't want to be on their shit
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most companies are any country that's
legalized recreational cannabis is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: total shit list for Interpol International
Narcotics Control Board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be like Canada and Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God Mexico Supreme Court didn't go
forward with their one program and now the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical program first, but always start
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you focus based on the patients and
doctor education, that's how actually
[SPEAKER_00]: programs evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the main flaw with Germany,
which we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's obviously demand, like multi
trillion dollar velocity of capital
[SPEAKER_00]: industry happening illicitly as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a risk standpoint, it's like,
are people going to use this or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they already do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make it better and cheaper
and higher quality and understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So demand is only going to start to
skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest thing that we have to do
in any of your markets is doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not just saying like I took
this product and now my cancer is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cured my cancer like medical studies,
medical trials, like sort of continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical education.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you educate the doctors and you keep
this patient focused, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that work programs that don't
work like Macedonia or others that we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't focus on the medical patient
demand or doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, if you want to have an
international program, you must be
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant in your country for what you
want to do and for the countries that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're exporting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, for example, want to be a mass
producer in Sri Lanka, with some pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: program, but not actually allow medical
cannabis for people in Sri Lanka,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sri Lanka, you're not compliant with the U
.N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single Convention, like the Single
Convention, 1961 Psychotropic Substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: the international bedrock of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your doctrine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're actually in this industry and
the changes that we're going to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: that are happening with that are actually
the secret roadmap to how this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is going to unfold in the next
three to five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you're going to be buying
shares of like Amazon for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so it's like this next period is the
only time that matters in the startup
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the key secrets to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the World Health Organization for
the people that were at the U.N.
[SPEAKER_00]: in like November, December, it was just
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had this big report they worked on
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like they did their big
meeting in like the last couple of minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: like and the cannabis part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, yeah, we've reviewed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not comfortable releasing our
results right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they like drop the mic and left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, OK, what did that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've understood that they're actually
calling for like a rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the U.N.
[SPEAKER_00]: not adopting this in March, like we
thought might happen when this happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go from like every single country in
the single convention, like one hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and sixty eight from having the ability to
do these trade programs to mandatorily
[SPEAKER_00]: having to provide medical cannabis or
products to patients in their country if a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor writes a prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got offtake agreements with 14
countries, better cans got 19 currently
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone talks about their exclusives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to go from like 14 to 20 potential
clients, let's say to one hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: sixty eight mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think every single country in that
program is going to say, hey, let's start
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis production company or program
and regulate it and understand this or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be like, hey,
we should just buy pharmaceutical products
[SPEAKER_00]: from people who produce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not going to be from Canada
because they're breaking international
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the INCB, when they did their
report, they're always a year behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they call us the stoners and
slow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes them a year to publish the report
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 2018 report that's the current one now
pretty much says like who's naughty,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's nice, like Santa Claus list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at investments and
potential market risks, that's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: secret of like who is a good country to do
this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the secret from this report also is
that legalizing medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalizing for recreational purposes,
very big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That convention says you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moment that you legalize
recreational cannabis, you essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: void yourself from being a big
international player in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, currently, yeah, we've got Canada
doing some of that, but it's only because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were the only people that had enough
supply under even their GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crappy Canadian standards, no offense,
which Germany was allowing because they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have enough supply for their
patients from like Bedrikan, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Bedrikan is a whole nother story
that I mean, we don't have time for
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of move forward a little
bit quickly, like there's medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, there's recreational cannabis,
there's hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one species, like biology degrees,
like biological definition of a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know science quiz, the ability to
make sexually viable offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I take like this dog and make this
dog, that dog can make more dogs and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be half and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only difference between dogs,
just like we've done is we've bred them
[SPEAKER_00]: for specific needs over tens of thousands
of years from like we took a wolf and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like, this thing's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got like little itty bitty dogs
and Great Danes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is like our Great Dane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that we bred it that way
for like paper, fiber, like protein
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, but it wasn't like the one that
was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we bred this other type variety,
but it's still the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only definition of this or change
is just THC, which should be THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which like some countries are 0.2%,
0.3, 0.4, or 1% Switzerland, Iraq.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having that higher standard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really nice, but know that this
is a type of license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical cannabis is another type of
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational is another type, but the risk
profile recreational, huge risk profile
[SPEAKER_00]: medical here and then hemp much,
much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted one of the first time crops
legally in the United States in 2014 under
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time some of these growers
that had ever seen a cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growing outside and they're like,
why have we been growing this indoors for
[SPEAKER_00]: so many years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was fucking illegal and we had to
hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we weren't meant like to grow this
plant in warehouses under streetlights,
[SPEAKER_00]: which until Gavitas and like digital
bulbs, digital, it was streetlights we
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how I got into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My care provider, I saw how he was growing
plants in his basement, this medical plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that really helped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you're in, you're a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like dangerous pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where this industry,
when I say it's agriculture, this will get
[SPEAKER_00]: to three cents on the dollar, like corn or
soybeans or other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to like get that value out is
like, if you're growing corn and making
[SPEAKER_00]: corn syrup, like, and then like having
distribution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just a farmer alone without
like strategic partnerships, price is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to keep coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big outdoor plots are going to keep
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to think about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, yeah, bulldog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never take like hemp and breed it
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we do because we found so many
different cannabinoids in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of hemp, like I can get for CBA
CBG, for example, or CBN, like 60,000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 90,000 a kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for that, and everyone's talking
about CBD, which is great, but 95% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD industry internationally is completely
bogus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even some of the things in
Switzerland, no offense, like kind of are
[SPEAKER_00]: bogus too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some very bona fide
companies and a very important like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid out of hundred plus that we
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more than just CBD from hemp
that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long term this sector, like from hemp
creep and clothing and protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: like huge sector that people are barely
beginning to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too expensive in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had like a quarter billion lacking of
like D quarters or combines or how to like
[SPEAKER_00]: plant tons and tons of clones in a field
like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this this sector starts to change
hemp, not just from the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction standpoint, it's going to be
huge as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always go from one sector to invest
into the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need this in the bigger picture
for your investment portfolios.
[SPEAKER_00]: The piece with like Switzerland has been
so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at all these companies doing this
and then Spain freaked out, the UK freaked
[SPEAKER_00]: out like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to be novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food because like we had food products
before 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD is not 100 percent legal like
everyone thinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone just goes around thinking like
it's legal and they legalize it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and the farm bill 2014,
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can cross state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are semis being pulled over and people
put in jail for like hemp biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's not understanding and
people don't have high pressure liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography instruments to like test
like things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to do the
international CBD and hemp policy part,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have mentioned novel
foods, which I've got a slide on one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important things for you if
you're doing non psychoactive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have one of those 69
licenses in the world to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a you're in a world of hurt
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA is kind of like the gold seal for
at least like where an import market is
[SPEAKER_00]: for pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a pharmaceutical
product, you're anywhere from 10 to 11
[SPEAKER_00]: years from like idea to pharmacy shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, internationally,
you have the medical cannabis flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: then oil and then the compounding is
happening in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sell transdermal patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sell vape cartridges or nasal
sprays because those have to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: drug discovery and clinical trials and
product registrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a company doing like the
medical or the recreational side,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to think like long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to take more time than you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidex, Sativex, GW Pharmaceuticals years
and years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at their stock now for even
having one product with two point five
[SPEAKER_00]: percent two point five percent or two
point five milligrams, two point five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's five milligrams like of cannabinoids
in a dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty six thousand a year for that
product in the United States, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: complete bullshit because kids with
epilepsy shouldn't have to their parents
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have to pay such premiums on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these companies do get to bring
medicine to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the companies that are starting to
look at how to work towards getting drug
[SPEAKER_00]: approval in the US drug approval in other
countries first, where it's cheaper and
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa, Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's four or five that we work
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For drug discovery, that's the crown jewel
for exits for drug discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often do we find some new thing
that we can make pharmaceutical drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: change the world that have hardly any side
effects compared to what we typically use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you should be shooting for
from an international side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about this because we've
worked now in 19 countries, like with
[SPEAKER_00]: license work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this game, like if you played it as a
kid, it's always like you start and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: open and like you put your little pieces
around and you only get to do this once
[SPEAKER_00]: after you go around and all the little
places have their like then you just
[SPEAKER_00]: fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, new countries are opening
up new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where like where are you
planting your flag and how many flags can
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant at a time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be like Tilray trying to take
over the world or canopy thinking you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just raise cheap capital here and then
deploy it around the world while back
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're breaking international law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have something good,
it always takes the local team in the
[SPEAKER_00]: local market to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I see the big Canadian strategies
of going to take over the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always local problems and
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you have a product,
if you have a company, a team,
[SPEAKER_00]: a license in a unique place, what do you
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Find your right partnerships and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we look for, for an
investment basis, like that good team in a
[SPEAKER_00]: market with some sort of unique advantage
and they're hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we work all over the world to
find these.
[SPEAKER_00]: EU is kind of huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're not technically in it right
now in little province here, but the EU is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a crown jewel for what's going to be
required from like a standard standpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: from around the world with the amount of
companies and countries that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one that actually matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Germany is like setting standards
with the beef farm, but it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's pretty close, but like kind of
a fucking crazy program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to take a lot longer than
they think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for even how much is happening in the
EU, what's beautiful about the EU is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you are a country in the EU and you get a
drug product registered, you're the same
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian companies trying to make
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to every company,
every country, get approval, go through
[SPEAKER_00]: all this bullshit, all these testing,
all these inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time and sometimes it
doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You produce a product in the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which countries in the EU are actually
allowing production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live there now for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, that was the first tinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second tinder is a little bit better,
but still complete bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got Germany, which sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal, which is amazing, but almost
impossible to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to have some slides on
Cyprus and Malta, but like Greece is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that people talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem with Greece though, is that they,
that's I'm the unprofessional one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise I'm not going to take that call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece copied a lot of Israeli laws that
then made their standard deviation pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one problem with Greece and like my
parents live there, love it, have been
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece is in the EU, but it's like not
like a favorable position or viewed,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just kind of like, like Italy,
like corruption business, kind of some
[SPEAKER_00]: weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of companies and countries in
the EU are just concerned on working with
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece, cannabis companies and programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing we're seeing for companies
outside of it, like Macedonia with like
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal shipments from one place to
another to pull into then Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those things, once your company gets
bad credibility for something in their
[SPEAKER_00]: program, you're toxic because this is
about like international pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though Greece is in the EU,
if they make a couple changes to their
[SPEAKER_00]: program, it could be very, very bona fide,
but there's a reason I didn't go after
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like Takum and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went after those first licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate's good labor understood,
but also just like Columbia, which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get into, which has massive opportunities,
but 85, 90% of what will happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia is complete garbage as well,
because it's not compliant on an
[SPEAKER_00]: international basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So EU, by them actually saying like,
we're going to like change this,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of be a leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada thought they were, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States, obviously we're like
light years behind what could happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see major pharmaceutical
development of cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on testing standards and regulations
that then the intellectual property will
[SPEAKER_00]: be owned, brand license around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there's only a few companies,
the countries that actually allow this to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, that's where the focus needs to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only ones that do are hardest
hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or then you have like the Denmark side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a pilot program, very,
very short-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also have to think where you're
positioning, what you're using that
[SPEAKER_00]: position for, for the next step and not
just get like run over just like you did
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by, by rescheduling and the
reclassification of CBD, this set
[SPEAKER_00]: international policy, which is going to
change the game, which is allowing so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's going to be great out of
Switzerland, pure in some of the others to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there'll probably be six,
700 producers here that have no market or
[SPEAKER_00]: no opportunity because they're not
producing at a compliance standards level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of Swiss investments are going to
be complete garbage and waste of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of like smoking bad hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with bad CBD companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany's like our crown jewel speed up a
little bit to go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major problem though, with this program,
the doctor education piece, when you think
[SPEAKER_00]: of, they didn't even know kind of like
California, how many patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many products, but Germany for an
import market is the gold standard that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone wants for offtake agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's seven main key players there
that control that piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in with them, you're very,
very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the secret with the German program,
the first Tinder, which now is my model
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I meet the standard that they set and
I'm the lowest price, I win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So volume over margin every single day in
cannabis and be willing to have a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: margin in the beginning to just undercut
your competitors, to take the whole market
[SPEAKER_00]: share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not about a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about, are you the standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the lowest price?
[SPEAKER_00]: You win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather be the generic of Viagra
than Viagra any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because after like the first drugs come
out and like the advertising wears off,
[SPEAKER_00]: generic is where it all goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've seen though, is it's so low the
amount of prescriptions happening because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not enough doctors that understand
cannabis and they only allow smokable
[SPEAKER_00]: flour and oils that have to be compounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once Germany is allowing product
registrations, game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when like some of the new German
licenses for contract manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'll invest into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck investing into growing cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their vat is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their climate's not that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at Portugal, it's
probably still a 10th of the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both in the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a reason I have a 10
because there's a lot of sun in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at like all the bids, all the
things that happened, all the Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that like tried to partner their
over 100 million euros spent on that first
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinder process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second Tinder process is a joke upon a
joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I don't apply for a license with a
team in a market, there's a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did not apply for one of these
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of opportunity,
but it's not going to be a world leader
[SPEAKER_00]: for massive cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Innovation, technology, and drug
discovery, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland, love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I liked the joke earlier about
like Belgium, but I'm not going to say it
[SPEAKER_00]: about chocolate and child abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've seen with Switzerland with
this 1%, it's changed the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because outside of Switzerland,
how many hemp varieties are allowed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of Switzerland, like two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two varieties, like hemp
varieties, like the European Commission
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's like kind of classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with like Bedrikan
having five varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're curtailed on genetics,
you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding, the research and
development, like some of the tours I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do tomorrow, I just have to figure out
still sharing the profits, like how to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually export genetics legally based on
some of the R&D here, because it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible with what some of the Swiss
have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, five, 600 of those will not
protect that correctly and get these to
[SPEAKER_00]: the world market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're trying to do
compliance first, that'll be the key to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is you will have this hemp CBD
side, but your medical cannabis program is
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like know that by using this,
like lobby and push for the next position,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where the huge revenue
potential and the non-psychoactive CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: side, very, very good, but medical
cannabis, they're suffering patients here
[SPEAKER_00]: that need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this policy to kind of move forward
with the Swiss program.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was kind of amazing and like actually
the stances that they've had, Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wholeheartedly believe, I thought
Poland, Switzerland, Austria, from like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp side, Italy, kind of like the Greece
thing, like this is like one of the key
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in Europe and in the world for
like non-psychoactive CBD hemp and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation, the policies that'll happen,
there'll be some great investments here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but know that like 90 out of every hundred
can pure crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be very, very careful with
your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria, like their medical program,
complete garbage, hemp side looking very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very favorable with what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing in comparison though to what you
can do here in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strategic partnerships here with Swiss
companies doing this correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you saw some press releases in
public news this last week will be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very paramount for creating some huge
valuations, public and private in this
[SPEAKER_00]: next quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I, I'm not, I don't have that one
slide about the Eagle in the, but Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially great medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially get medicine to patients when
they legalized their medical program as a
[SPEAKER_00]: country in a G8.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what allowed the public markets to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so many fraudulent public companies
have hurt now cannabis and then like
[SPEAKER_00]: raising capital easily going and
scheduling around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada has hurt medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like worldwide, why is Tilray only making
23 million in revenue in a quarter when we
[SPEAKER_00]: have like California companies doing that
practically a month, but they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're Tilray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is like, so you have to look at some
of these public valuations and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening and what's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Canada being the first to do
this, it gave them major market position.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just like Bruce and others have seen,
we have to divest of certain positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to acquire and do major mergers
and acquisitions with this, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: happening fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as oversupply is happening in Canada,
there's like 700 new companies being built
[SPEAKER_00]: as we speak construction to grow more
cannabis in an already flooded market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Canada based on breaking international
law for legalizing rec irrigated to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one cares about that program very
much compared to Canada for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay is what's going to happen then by
them breaking international law in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: and other countries are not going to allow
their medical imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once there's enough certified compliance
supply from other producers, AKA Portugal
[SPEAKER_00]: or Denmark or some of these other
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Columbia with a non psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a very limited window where
they're taking over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to be able to buy their
supply in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be other supply and that'll all
be in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a price for a gram, what,
10 cents maybe someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that whole stock side,
very few of those are going to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't get into other markets
quickly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used it at first, but then they
entrenched too deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at all the companies that
are listed, and how many are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: delisted or when they're raising capital
in Canada to then invest into the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States or other programs or allowing
foreign nationals to invest into something
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal in the United States and
facilitating it as a public vehicle
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I know I want to have much more
time, but with Israel, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that got to list some very good
public companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now why do we have 40 new Israeli
companies listing in, in Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're all trying to do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Israeli exchange Tel Aviv exchange
pretty much said like we can't not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened in Canada to happen with our
medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like, like to make fun of
Tilray for a lot of reasons, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to think about this industry
and what we're able to do with these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and products like for changing
people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, this is like that kind of heart
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we only have so much time to do this
and there's a lot of shit heads and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of assholes using this very, very special
sacred plant to just pump and dump stock
[SPEAKER_00]: valuations to like buy Maseratis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've seen it, like raising capital
is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first couple of hundred million we
raised, I thought it would take forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now internationally, it seems like it's so
much easier because international
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical drug discovery,
you realize you've got one moment to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this and it takes a lot of capital and
raising capital is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone just lists, does some press
releases and thinks that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be able to then make
these different positions, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like Silicon Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Private companies, private investments,
scaling and positioning correctly will be
[SPEAKER_00]: more powerful than the public market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on this side and public does have an
advantage for a lot of our portfolios for
[SPEAKER_00]: their exits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always love those series a series B
positions early on in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just know if you do list and that
whole sector has a change, even if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a great company, you're pulled down with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why can't I get any shares to short
Tilray or why do I have to pay 25 to 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: carry just to get shares to borrow to
short them as they tied them all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they know that the revenue
evaluations are nowhere close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're investing into publics,
yeah, just put some money there,
[SPEAKER_00]: set it aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will make it, but most likely it has
to be private side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a whole bunch more to go through,
but we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, team Sergio Olga, a few others are
around, but thanks so much for letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: share a little insight into the
international markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
