[SPEAKER_07]: The science of cannabis extraction,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a science.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't just wash your hash or get some
tubes in a can of butane and try not to
[SPEAKER_07]: blow yourself up in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a better way to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's way more technical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead us in this, German YouTube
cannabis activist and pioneer and
[SPEAKER_07]: legendary, I don't even know how you say
legendary cannabis user in German,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm sure there's a word for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Michael Knott.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it was fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: So welcome everybody to our panel of the
science about the science of cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm very glad, I'm very proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: To present you five experts in cannabis
extraction from different companies,
[SPEAKER_08]: from different continents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me start to introduce,
I will introduce anybody when he answers
[SPEAKER_08]: his first question, so you don't have to
wait so long for our expertise.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my first question, my introduction is
to Mr. Nick Bruzianos, is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not so good at pronouncing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're in the cannabis business or in
the extraction business quite long.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2019, you founded Cannabreeze,
which is a quite successful B2B
[SPEAKER_08]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we all know, we're talking about,
on the ICBC, we're always talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: two different markets.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about the European market
and we're talking about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Canadian market, the overseas
market, how we call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to cannabis extraction,
what would you say, what are the basic
[SPEAKER_08]: difference, because you are experienced on
both sides of the Atlantic, so what would
[SPEAKER_08]: you say, which is what are the basic
difference between our two markets or the
[SPEAKER_08]: two markets?
[SPEAKER_05]: Regulation is more strict in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking care of safety factors of the
extraction methods are much stricter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also documentation and the key word here
is also EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are factors that they are not so
strong in the U.S., although in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and Canada, although of course they take
good care of safety, but at a different
[SPEAKER_05]: level that we would like to do it here in
the EU.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is my next question, goes to the
next expert who is also experienced on
[SPEAKER_08]: both continents.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Ruiz Juarez, you're working for your
CEO of Paralab, which is located in
[SPEAKER_08]: Portugal, and what would you say,
what are your experiences, Yuri,
[SPEAKER_08]: mostly because Portugal is part of the EU
and Portugal only can medical cannabis is
[SPEAKER_08]: legal, recreational is still illegal,
so what are your experience with
[SPEAKER_08]: especially European regulation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the European regulation,
actually, I think, comes for good because
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the United States,
and if we look, say, for reports from
[SPEAKER_03]: Bright Labs, I think from 2021,
30% of extracts had high contaminations of
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides, and so these are the ones that
are actually measured, so the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: send samples to be analyzed, that is,
I think, a small minority.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want to have a safe cannabis use,
it doesn't matter if it's medical or if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's recreational in Europe so that people
can consume knowing that they are taking a
[SPEAKER_03]: safe product, regulation is absolutely
necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all in in terms of the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when it comes to regulation,
we also have to talk about extraction
[SPEAKER_08]: technique because the better the
technique, the fewer the product is,
[SPEAKER_08]: George.
[SPEAKER_08]: We met this morning, and he's in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: and also in the European extraction
industry, and he introduced me a technique
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of, and I'm not too deep,
but at least I wrote a book about cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction, which is available here also
in German language, and I was really
[SPEAKER_08]: surprised about the way you do your
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's different, the way you do your
extraction from the standard extraction?
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk extraction, we always have to
honor Europe as where the extraction is
[SPEAKER_04]: originated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Claudius Colenicus in the Hundred Years
A.D.
[SPEAKER_04]: started extracting with ethanol and water,
and he documented that for over 150
[SPEAKER_04]: different herbs, and it's really,
to our days, Europe has been operating
[SPEAKER_04]: based on strict regulations, and
everything that we do into the extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: space, we try to make and improve this
extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been, after the simple methods of
extraction, liquefied gas extraction was
[SPEAKER_04]: added, which is very quick and clean
extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an extraction which improves the
purity of the extract regulated by pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I've developed is the next
generation of liquefied gas extraction
[SPEAKER_04]: that works, combines the advantages of all
current extractions, the ethanol,
[SPEAKER_04]: the butane, the hydrocarbons, the CO2,
and it's something that delivers a full
[SPEAKER_04]: power of the plant into ambient
conditions, preserving the pH and the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal values.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, in pure five extraction,
we've been working that in the last 10
[SPEAKER_04]: years in the cannabis industry,
and the last 20 years into the fragrance
[SPEAKER_04]: and flavor industry, improving that
extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, George.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonah, Jonah Barber, we know quite a long
time already.
[SPEAKER_08]: He comes from the consumer side of
cannabis, may I say so?
[SPEAKER_08]: You used to be consumer before you went
into the business?
[SPEAKER_06]: They say do what you love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did find a lot of early benefits from
that side.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what also drove me to get into the
industry was my passion, just believing in
[SPEAKER_06]: the therapeutic and benefits of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you built up MIX Labs in 2013
already, which means you're in the lab
[SPEAKER_08]: business and the extraction business,
you know the products for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you say the difference between
European extraction, which you're not,
[SPEAKER_08]: or what is most advanced?
[SPEAKER_08]: What does the consumer search in the
overseas market at the moment,
[SPEAKER_08]: and what does the consumer search here in
the European market?
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think the way I would look at it
is I see Europe where probably the US was
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe like 10 years ago is probably a
pretty good comparison to when we started
[SPEAKER_06]: in the analytical labs, which was really
interesting because being at an analytical
[SPEAKER_06]: lab, you're at the forefront of products.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see everything that's coming into the
lab, what's moving, what's popular.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember back in 2012 when we
started the lab, all we saw was flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then overnight we just started seeing
extracts just flood into the lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually it was very poor extracts to
be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, I so badly wanted to like them,
but I hated it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tasted like burnt popcorn and just
they're adding propylene glycol.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just there was heavy solvent still left in
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually very scary because there
was no solvent testing required at the
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you were seeing, so people were
doing QC testing, but they're still
[SPEAKER_06]: putting those products out in the market
for medicinal reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just very scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually what led us into getting into
the extraction side was based off test
[SPEAKER_06]: results.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where we started MRX,
which is now Decimal, which does
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to answer your question, so from that
side, it was very heavily flour in the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it very quickly kind of evolved
into extraction, which was a combination
[SPEAKER_06]: of vape pins at intervals, topicals,
creams.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we'll see that here
shortly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in Europe, I think what people
will see is it'll start slow, but then it
[SPEAKER_06]: ramps up really, really quick from that
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so just some of the advice I would
give people that are starting out is to
[SPEAKER_06]: plan for rapid expansion quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not trying to play catch up or
change a lot of your infrastructure or
[SPEAKER_06]: things like that as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plan for that now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also I'd say be versatile from that
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be very important to be
versatile to the market, especially when
[SPEAKER_06]: it gets to a recreational side when it
ultimately gets there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the market can be very finicky and
also change very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what might be popular one year might
be something completely different the next
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're in a position to essentially
be able to adapt quickly, you'll be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to grab a bigger market share a lot faster
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think you'll just really see the
products as it evolves really expand quite
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jonah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steve.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're also a long experience in the US
cannabis industry for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're working for Syfy or you founded
Syfy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're more from the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a German cannabis activist,
I always looked on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: But is there anything different on the
East Coast?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you use different techniques over there
or is there a different cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction culture?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because cannabis in New York is legal now,
I've heard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any difference or local
difference in extraction techniques?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny to say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a CEO of Manzana Extracts in New York
State and we're starting an operation
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see New York in a very similar phase
or stage to where Europe is right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it seems like most countries go
through these stages of early adoption and
[SPEAKER_09]: then ramping up efficiency.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to Jonah's point, I think the biggest
thing, one of the biggest things I see
[SPEAKER_09]: here that's very different both in New
York and here versus the West Coast is
[SPEAKER_09]: scale.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see people trying to process one or two
pounds at a time in the small scales,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is easy to do with rosin presses and
that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But eventually when prices drop,
and they will, you're going to need to
[SPEAKER_09]: scale up so efficiencies of scale take
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where the larger ethanol,
larger CO2, larger hydrocarbon machines
[SPEAKER_09]: become more potent.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that we're very focused on
are terpenes, not just the extraction of
[SPEAKER_09]: them, but the separation of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think as this market evolves,
there'll be a big need for extraction of
[SPEAKER_09]: extra terpene production and a lot of that
will come from hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rumor, just next question,
the rumor in Germany is terpenes extracted
[SPEAKER_08]: from hemp are too expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would say that terpenes are too
expensive to begin with because they're
[SPEAKER_09]: ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're difficult to capture in their
entirety.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're difficult to store in their
entirety and keep them unaltered.
[SPEAKER_09]: And most extraction methods, and I hope I
won't offend anybody on the panel by
[SPEAKER_09]: saying this, but very often techniques
like ethanol extraction can destroy those
[SPEAKER_09]: valuable terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: CO2 has the capacity to capture them at a
subcritical level, but most of us in the
[SPEAKER_09]: industry who extract would agree that the
propanes and butanes tend to be the best
[SPEAKER_09]: at capturing the full spectrum of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last thing I'll add to that is
that there are new technologies coming in
[SPEAKER_09]: play right now through membranes that
allow you to separate those terpenes from
[SPEAKER_09]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: And ultimately where this market ends up,
if you're really speaking about medical
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis, is to get pure constituents,
pure THC, pure CBD, and generally that
[SPEAKER_09]: involves some form of crystallization.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we take those terpenes out,
we can then move towards that
[SPEAKER_09]: crystallization and then reconstitute,
or as pharmacists call it, recompound to
[SPEAKER_09]: precise doses and then we can really start
to talk about medical products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me speak out a theory.
[SPEAKER_08]: The lower the boiling point of the solvent
is, the better the product is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody who wants can answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: George, you looked at me first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, I agree with that because
boiling point, now the most popular
[SPEAKER_04]: methods are separating components by
boiling points.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you have, let's say, I don't
know, at 80 and your first terpenes
[SPEAKER_04]: evaporating at 100, then you don't really
have a margin to separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to end up with a lot of
residual solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why going super critical on CO2 or
using aerosol or 134 or using butane where
[SPEAKER_04]: the boiling point is close to zero and you
have a full hundred degree of separation,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can really preserve those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important also not to destruct
and destroy these terpenes because some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the methods during heat and oxygen,
it oxidizes the terps and you lose more
[SPEAKER_04]: terps very often because they're the
smallest molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the size of terps actually,
it is known by the science that currently
[SPEAKER_04]: the terps, they enhance the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50%, like if they go into the body,
they activate the receptor 50% before the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid connects to the receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a recent study from Russo a few
months ago and that proves that preserving
[SPEAKER_04]: the full terpene profile of a plant as it
appears in the strain is going to increase
[SPEAKER_04]: bioavailability of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not looking for like water soluble or
anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: A plant by itself provides you the option
for better medical treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So preserving the terpenes in a full
profile is very important for the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal values of the plant by itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to add to that, and I'll start by
saying there's no one perfect extraction
[SPEAKER_06]: method or one extraction method that's
better than another.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all depends on what someone wants to
make.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we're talking about terpene
preservation and things like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what's really unique and exciting
to be able to introduce to Europe that's
[SPEAKER_06]: been doing in the US is from a hydrocarbon
extraction standpoint, is being able to
[SPEAKER_06]: run fresh frozen and run it and get like
the highest terpene content in doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's some groups here we're
talking about too, which also changes the
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation side because no one's been
looking at doing that over here as well
[SPEAKER_06]: too to how to properly, you know,
store fresh frozen, get ready for the
[SPEAKER_06]: extractors because there hasn't been an
opportunity yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my opinion, that's one of the best
ways to get the highest terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are a new kidding block that is
still CO2, but CO2 under pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the cryogenic temperatures between
zero and minus 20, here you can also work
[SPEAKER_03]: with freshly frozen flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can even tune if you use small amounts
of co-solvent like ethanol and other class
[SPEAKER_03]: two solvents that are allowed for medical
and pharmaceutical applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you can tune even for the type of
terpenes, so mon, odd, d, or tri-terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: and save them with efficiencies of over
90%.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the advantage to other butane or so
on because when you are using butane,
[SPEAKER_03]: you always keep these gases at service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have to go to vacuum,
applications of vacuum treatment in vacuum
[SPEAKER_03]: ovens to the gas to take the hydrocarbon
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But both terpenes are also volatile,
so you are also losing in these process
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are extracting using these CO2,
cryo-CO2 method of once you bring to
[SPEAKER_03]: ambient temperature, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end, the efficiencies in terms
of capturing terpenes is higher,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you also can tune these.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, this same technique can
extract with efficiencies over 90% the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, by tuning the plurality of
our solvent that is mixed between the
[SPEAKER_03]: liquid CO2 and the ethanol or other class
two solvents, you are very selective to
[SPEAKER_03]: what you are aiming to extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be THC, it can be CBD, or it can be
a flavonoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best proof and fantastic thing
about this new technology is that it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't matter if you are extracting from
really bad starting material like shredded
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass from hemp, flowers and leaves
together with 2, 3%, or if you have hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: with 5, 6%, or if you have a 10% flower or
a 15 potency flower, 20 or 25,
[SPEAKER_03]: your extracts will be always over 80%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you are simply extracting what you
want, cannabinoids, leaving most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other unwanted components behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on this action for 35 years in
CO2, typically supercritical applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: This technique can run in a supercritical
typical system, but modified to have in
[SPEAKER_03]: these conditions, and this is unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually in supercritical extraction,
you don't get quality and speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want high quality, so if you are a
pure extract, you have to go slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Low pressures, low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you don't get quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: With this technique, for the same
extractor vessel, you are increasing 3 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 5 times the throughput, but keeping an
extremely high quality extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really groundbreaking,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that works on CO2 extraction for
over 35 years is a very big step forward
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen over these 35 years because CO2
in these years didn't change much,
[SPEAKER_03]: so this was a big improvement that I
highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to CO2 extraction,
you need a lot of equipment, let me say it
[SPEAKER_08]: easily, or in an easy way.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Germany, we'll have cannabis clubs very
soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of extractions,
but there are not a lot of solvent
[SPEAKER_08]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even water hash, though water is not a
solvent, is considered a solvent
extractor.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you recommend them,
Nick?
[SPEAKER_08]: The German cannabis clubs, probably some
are sitting here and listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: With regards to water extraction?
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have a cannabis club, you produce
cannabis for 500 people, and you want to
[SPEAKER_08]: make extraction, but you're not allowed to
do solvent extraction, and you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: allowed to do water hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you recommend the German club?
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot do solvent, and you cannot do
water extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess you can press it?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can press it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything which is mechanical.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, water extraction is mechanical
extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, but because we don't have experts
who are in response of the law,
[SPEAKER_08]: they consider water extraction as a
solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people from the cannabis industry try
to explain, try to lobby that water hash
[SPEAKER_08]: is not a solvent extractor, it's
non-solvent, but they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's considered mechanical separation,
in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also because it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not allowed on a private level
because it's dangerous, for example in
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado, and they just didn't understand
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of lawyers made it, but there were
not too many cannabis experts when it came
[SPEAKER_08]: to the law, so that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess there are not many options
left.
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2, I guess it's out of the picture as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are we left with?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vapor static.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to extract for 500 people
every month, and actually you can make
[SPEAKER_08]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vapor static could be a solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's a way of extracting with no
solvents, with using heat and evaporating
[SPEAKER_05]: the oils out of the plants, and then
collecting them again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that could be, but then again,
you need very big systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the small size of the social clubs,
it becomes very narrow, the options.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're talking about small amounts with
small systems, I guess making kif and
[SPEAKER_05]: pressing it should be a way that is
mechanical purely, and it can work for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on a level, anybody else can answer,
please, on a level where you make it for
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 people, would you agree to say that's
not economical at all if you cannot do
[SPEAKER_08]: solvent extraction?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree to that because when you use
sifting, you only rely on the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there is much more potency inside of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use probably 30% of the entire
cannabinoids into the plant, and any
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanical extraction is not selective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the quality of the extract,
it kind of may vary a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I completely understand their decision
of trying to put the water into the
[SPEAKER_04]: solvent because once they say water is
legal then, or good for solventless,
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately two other matters are gonna
get in, that the steam extraction,
[SPEAKER_04]: steam distillation, and superheated water
extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Superheated water extraction is a special
type of extraction which also we produce
[SPEAKER_04]: that can make water to behave as an
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you really can get a very good extract
out of that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they have this concern when they
try to classify harsh bubble extraction,
[SPEAKER_04]: but still sifting and pressing,
or pressing even without sifting,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then you're gonna end up with some
chlorophylls and some other things that
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't really know, that you don't
really want into, they will influence the
[SPEAKER_04]: taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting because water,
steam extraction, I wrote my book four
[SPEAKER_08]: years ago, and I announced in the last
chapter that steam extraction is the
[SPEAKER_08]: future, but there was no steam extraction
at that time.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you say about steam extraction?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is very, very interesting in
my eyes because it's under hot steam,
[SPEAKER_08]: under pressure, and there are no solvents
at all, it's just water.
[SPEAKER_08]: So did you hear about it?
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you say about steam extraction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Steam extraction, I know, applications
only for the pins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we don't care for how the flower
stays after, and if the pins is the only
[SPEAKER_03]: main compound we want to extract,
steam distillation is absolutely the best
[SPEAKER_03]: technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: The efficiencies for the pins is high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised when I heard saying that
it's expensive to extract the pins from
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, because steam distillation is a
quite low-cost extraction technique,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's extremely efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried this with hemp and the results
were fantastic, and I was comparing with
[SPEAKER_03]: all techniques discussed today here
without any exception, and steam
[SPEAKER_03]: distillation for the pins got the best
results period by far.
[SPEAKER_03]: The efficiencies were huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is one new kid on the block also
there, not commercially available,
[SPEAKER_03]: still in development, but coming soon,
that may resolve the German problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: microwave extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's already using it now for the pins,
and is commercially available,
[SPEAKER_03]: patented by an Italian company,
but with very good results, expensive
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment, but is coming now a solution
for cannabinoid extraction, also based on
[SPEAKER_03]: microwave.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you maybe explain to me and to the
audience, in a few words, how microwave
[SPEAKER_08]: extraction works?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, microwave is just a type of wave in
a certain spectrum zone of the radio
[SPEAKER_03]: frequency spectrum that, as you all know,
we have microwave ovens at home that has
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity to warm any material we put
inside the oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is that if you tune for certain
frequencies, microwave, you are making
[SPEAKER_03]: vibrating, for instance, only the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how the terpenes are extracted and
being volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by eating just the terpenes in the
flour, they vaporize, and then they are
[SPEAKER_03]: easily extracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how it's working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, with cannabinoids having been also
volatile, having higher boiling points,
[SPEAKER_03]: that task is not so simple, but there have
been advances on past years, and very soon
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be here equipment that will be
able to extract cannabinoids using
[SPEAKER_03]: microwaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not in market now because there
has been an effort to make this equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: GMP compliant for pharmaceutical
applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, I think it will be difficult to
get to that level, but for recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: adult use, the technology at its present
state, it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can be a next big thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting, because when I started
growing wheat in 1996, you were always
[SPEAKER_08]: tempted, maybe, to put the wheat in the
microwave after you harvested it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there was a rule, never do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: A good grower does not put his wheat in
the microwave.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I always learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear about microwave extraction,
or is that a topic in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know using microwaves for other things,
when it comes to processing and things
[SPEAKER_06]: like that and drying, but no, not for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an American technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an American company.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some technologies of the
microwave, but they also destruct very
[SPEAKER_04]: badly some long chain molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it needs to be perfected for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to just point up front,
which is that water is the quintessential
[SPEAKER_09]: universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is absolutely a solvent in that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: To address the issue earlier, I think that
a club could take dry ice, if it was
[SPEAKER_09]: practical, and tumble it, and get much
more efficacy and potency in tumbling,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then press that keif.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to the point of microwave,
I believe, it's my understanding that in
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada, it's being used with some success
in a CGMP environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for drying.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_03]: For drying, not for extraction yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a couple companies now that
are offering an extraction phase for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a cannabinoid extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew about the Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew about the Americans, not the
Canadians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good news.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also another thing called hollow
core technology extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, ultimately with all
extraction methods, as Joan has pointed
[SPEAKER_09]: out, there's a yin and a yang to all of
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the needle you have to thread is the
fine line between capex and opex.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one point that no one's brought up
yet that's going to be critical,
[SPEAKER_09]: not now, but when the market matures,
is the cost per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where certain methods will
start to win over others.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I would never debate that CO2
doesn't have some fantastic qualities to
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when those cost factors start to weigh
in, sometimes other methods will prove
[SPEAKER_09]: less costly.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not talk about the most popular or
the most spread extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about the extraction technique,
which is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: German pharmacies mostly extract with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the U.S., I mean, the advanced
technology companies in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_08]: do they still use alcohol, or is that,
so to speak, something you did 10 years
[SPEAKER_08]: ago?
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is alcohol is almost too
effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: It grabs so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so your downstream post-purification
needs to be even more robust.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'd agree with Steve on that,
where we see a lot of ethanol use is
[SPEAKER_06]: primarily built for, like, people that
want to go to bulk distillate or
[SPEAKER_06]: isolations, usually when we sell ethanol
systems from a volume standpoint.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're more focused on very high
terpene profile types, you're typically
[SPEAKER_06]: going to use a different, such as
hydrocarbon or CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And does anybody or any one of the
gentlemen see future in THC steam
[SPEAKER_08]: distillation under pressure?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think this will be like the future
of extraction, or this will never work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam distillation probably not going to
work for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too large molecule for evaporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs different parameters,
like to push into different temperatures
[SPEAKER_04]: in order to get it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we develop a special method,
which is super, some people call it
[SPEAKER_04]: supercritical, but it's really superheated
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's also under pressure with airless
environment, and when the water is put in
[SPEAKER_04]: that environment, it behaves like you can
tune it really, like 80% alcohol or 90%
[SPEAKER_04]: alcohol or 20% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really works into the full range of
CO2 as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you, George.
[SPEAKER_09]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_09]: The one challenge I would say,
it was brought up earlier, is there's more
[SPEAKER_09]: than one product that's being made in a
concentrate, and the question is what's
[SPEAKER_09]: the end product?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to an edible?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to a vape cart?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to something that might be
dabbleable?
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are very few solvents that can
span all of those product categories.
[SPEAKER_09]: That really is the linchpin of it all,
is being able to make all products at a
[SPEAKER_09]: low cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, and I think we are
quite late, but I think that one or two
[SPEAKER_08]: questions are possible if there are any
questions from the audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's one question from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope some cannabis clubs want to extract
soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not so experienced.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to have questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for the panel, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I don't butcher this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned a hollow tube extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, could you say something about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it came from the Bakken oil fields.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a way to separate the oil from the
sand, and it's proved to be expensive,
[SPEAKER_09]: but again, you're threading the needle of
cost, and it is extremely expensive on the
[SPEAKER_09]: capex side, buying it upfront,
and that's been the biggest barrier to
[SPEAKER_09]: that particular technology.
How does it work?
[SPEAKER_09]: We would need another 15 minutes,
and I'd need a board to draw on to explain
[SPEAKER_09]: it, but it's essentially almost a
microfiltration technology.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it in that way.
All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question would be, so the most
efficient way for those cannabis clubs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany would be this truck and ice
tumbling and pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be the best idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knocking heads, like here?
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be an easy and fast way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If especially you have all these
limitations, and until these limitations
[SPEAKER_05]: are gone, I guess it can be a good way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only consider the hash product as
byproduct of extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every way to make hash, either by direct
press or through sifting or through
[SPEAKER_04]: ultrasound even, it's going to be
sufficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, efficiency is not going to
be there, but at least it's the first
[SPEAKER_04]: step.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: That rule is going to evolve, it's going
to be changed, and it depends on how
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is going to start in the first
few months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe all the clubs are going to write a
proper response to the ruling,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's going to be voted in September
or in the fall with some changes,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for now, that unfortunately is the
only simple way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I expect here, I must admit,
Germany is quite good at engineering,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think one club will invent or build
a mega Rosenpress, five meters by five
[SPEAKER_08]: meters, where they can put half of the
harvest on.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I expect from the German
clubs here, please build a mega
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosenpress, because that's, in my eyes,
the only way to do it on a commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: I built a Rosenpress in Washington state,
it could press two kilos at a time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good Boeing engineers, whether that's good
or bad, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the one point I would like to make
about all hashes and Rosens is that if you
[SPEAKER_09]: were a gold miner, and there was a quarter
of an ounce of gold in your rock,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're only getting half, about half of it
out, and the only way to get that other
[SPEAKER_09]: half out is to use some type of solvent,
and when we pressed those Rosens,
[SPEAKER_09]: we would take the bags we pressed it,
all the biomass, we'd even scrape the
[SPEAKER_09]: plates, and we'd rerun that in a BHO,
or an ethanol process, to get the other
[SPEAKER_09]: half of the gold out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic, are there closing statements or
arguments you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: One question especially now for the German
social clubs, what do you think about,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you use tricypher pressing,
to do a separation, electric separation
[SPEAKER_02]: before?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like an interesting experiment,
let me know how it works out for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean really, I have to say, this entire
industry is one big R&D project,
[SPEAKER_09]: and none of us have all the answers here,
so seriously, let us know how that works
[SPEAKER_09]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The electrical, like what they call in the
moment, the static sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, can you repeat?
[SPEAKER_02]: The technique they call in the moment is
static sifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Static sifting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a hydrostatic extraction?
[SPEAKER_09]: That has benefits, but much like with
steam distillation, which again is very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very effective, we find you lose what we
call your high notes, and your low notes,
[SPEAKER_09]: and your terpenes, so you get more of a
blended terpene, you're gonna lose those
[SPEAKER_09]: sensations of a particular strain,
and you may also do what we call
[SPEAKER_09]: isomerized chemicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually in Washington State invented a
chemical called THC, TBDT, I believe was
[SPEAKER_09]: the chemical, and it was caused by too
much heat.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're changing the chemicals whenever
you're using heat, and that's the
[SPEAKER_09]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you for your expertise,
and especially for the German clubs who
[SPEAKER_08]: listen very well, because when it comes to
extraction, we have to learn a lot from
[SPEAKER_08]: all the guys from overseas, and from
Portugal, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it again, Michael Knope,
and the rest of the panelists.
