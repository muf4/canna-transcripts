[SPEAKER_00]: So, hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'd like to thank Alex and the ICBC
for this award.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think of it as a lifetime
achievement award, more as a tenaciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: award.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be an inspiration to
everyone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just last long enough, eventually
they'll call you an elder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't happened to me yet,
but I think that it will at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anyway, I worked long and hard on this
because I didn't want to do a Donald
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my entire views of the entire world
and the situation and it is dire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, more of my philosophy is one
of a great 20th century baseball player,
[SPEAKER_00]: Satchel Page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not recognized a lot because he
spent most of his time in the black
[SPEAKER_00]: leagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did say, somebody said he could
turn off the light and get under the
[SPEAKER_00]: covers before the light went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did say, don't look back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be gaining on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you start looking back,
it gets scary about some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you did in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd never do those things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Carlos Castaneda, who was a writer
about spirituality, had a character in his
[SPEAKER_00]: books by the name of Don Juan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Don Juan was this Indian shaman from
the Southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had all these psychedelics and
these different phytochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that he had this ally plant
that he would smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I read that book,
eventually I smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too eventually, but I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that, I don't know if that
was exactly his ally, but I realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana was my ally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized later on something that,
you know, the difference between marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: and politicians is that good marijuana
never tell a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think that the reason why I like
marijuana so much was described by Aldous
[SPEAKER_00]: Huxley when he talked about psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that, you know, we develop the
brain, the mind and our brain as a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it filters out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn what to filter out and how to
filter it out, depending on what society
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have sort of boxed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said that psychedelics alter the
brain's ability to be a filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these thoughts that would be boxed
in and wouldn't come into consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't fit the mold,
start shooting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's certainly what marijuana does
to me, and I'm sure to most people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just give you one example of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that Obama, when he first became
president, had marijuana deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, which people used to laugh at
when I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when physicians started saying
it, they took it more seriously for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, with marijuana deficiency
syndrome, he was not able to make wise
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why he was taken over the coals
by the banking industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he had only been able to smoke
marijuana and look at things from both the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight, with a straight mind and
somewhat altered mind that would allow him
[SPEAKER_00]: to be creative, we wouldn't have gone
through the wrenching thing that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the people who were wearing
pinstripes would be wearing horizontals
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if marijuana teaches you to think
outside the box, then thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said they agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I consider that a vast majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start thinking outside the box,
then you're going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say marijuana is an agent or
catalyst of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've been annoying people who
work with me at Quick Trading with some
[SPEAKER_00]: songs from the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm neither going to sing them nor
play them for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them was the Mothers of
Inventions song called Trouble Coming
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at that on YouTube and
with some of the videos, the song is 50
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could have been taking place this
summer on the streets, except that most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the videos show people rioting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it's cops rioting,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a second was Donovan's Season of
the Witch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say the second is really The Fug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Kill for Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that song from 50 years ago,
they say, if you don't kill them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Russians will.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want America to play second
fiddle, kill for peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isn't that what's going on right now,
50 years later?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different countries, same war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third was, and this is more
applicable directly to what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: now and why people are here, it's
Donovan's Season of the Witch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that, he has one line, beatniks out
to make it rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hippies, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, recognize yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why I got into marijuana is
because I hate war.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marijuana is an agent of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have not only Americans,
but the whole world has to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to get out of the war on
ourselves and the war on environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two things are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to do it is to change
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laws don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a change of consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marijuana helps you get out of that
box so you can actually see reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I wrote this marijuana users
bill of rights, which you can just go on
[SPEAKER_00]: Google and Google that in and it will come
right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those is that, and ultimately
that the questions or that bill of rights
[SPEAKER_00]: brings to mind something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, if it's a question of freedom
or profit, what do you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I would say many of the people who
are now in marijuana have chosen profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care about freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, freedom is, I'm in, let's close
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really think that that's a
really good policy for society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a stupid policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a policy that ultimately
brings illegality and illicit activities
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you can't get in the door,
you're still going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you going to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do it outside the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate the term organized crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand it and as I've seen it,
marijuana outside of the system is
[SPEAKER_00]: disorganized crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally disorganized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they want to talk about organized
crime and heroin or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Oxycontin with the cartels that are
making all these opioids, fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but leave marijuana out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please, please, when people say,
well, we're protecting society from
[SPEAKER_00]: organized crime and all that, that's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're protecting society from people
like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think is that, you know,
profit's really great, but I'd rather have
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a choice of profit or freedom,
I'll take freedom every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, only the people who really
believe that, who are willing to fight for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they're the only people who have
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to belong to the Yippies,
Youth International Party, and we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, when freedom is outlawed,
only outlaws will be free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, there are different,
like people are saying, well, Prop 64
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizes marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you have under an ounce,
if you're one of the chosen few who gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: license, then marijuana is legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have over an ounce,
if you want to grow plants in a county
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't allow plant growing,
if you want to sell to your friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not within the system,
then marijuana isn't legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Prop 64 is a farce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as people keep saying that
Prop 64 has to pass or else marijuana will
[SPEAKER_00]: be set back, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not sacrifice the people of
California for other people's ambition.
[SPEAKER_00]: 64 is just, when you read it, when you
actually read it, it's total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be totally legal in one county,
step over the line, you're illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fractionalizes California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a terrible law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worst part of it is it keeps the
cops in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants cops in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody here wants cops in their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd rather have civil regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you better start telling the people
who are voting or who are campaigning for
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 what you think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you want cops in your system
and taking your money, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing that Assad knows, don't feed
your enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why he's had that siege at Aleppo
all this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying I'm pro him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Prop 64 and the Oregon Initiative,
both of them feed the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you believe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeding your enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't going to, I promise not to
talk about 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, I think that marijuana
is an agent of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we really need this agent
of change because, you know, we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at war with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't only mean the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean people are at war with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were at war with their mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: They drill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pierce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tear it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break its skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put, they fill it with concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They toxify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we live that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eton Musk and a couple of others are
going to go try and find another planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't, you know, there's a
difference between Columbus coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: America and us going to, into space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference is, he had air to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he got here, when he got to the
new world, there was food to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and there was intercourse
back and forth between, between the
[SPEAKER_00]: continents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, when you go out into space,
it's a one way journey and you better take
[SPEAKER_00]: everything with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we forgot a piano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anybody take the Dylan tape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually as bad as 64 is, the one thing
that it will do is get more marijuana to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that what,
just what I was saying is that marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: is an agent of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being an agent of change, I think that
these laws or any laws that stop the free
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the United States, I don't think
they're going to be able to sell any
[SPEAKER_00]: quality marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I, I don't mean a regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean that, you know, anybody
should be able to sell any quality
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana just like they can food.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm, I'm talking about a regulated
market that protects a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but anybody should be able to get
into it and anybody should be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody should be able to buy and
anybody should be able to sell as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a license and the zoning and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state shouldn't be able to say,
I like you, but I don't like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be able to say, oh,
we have enough licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you let all the stores that want to
open, open, and you know that most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to close, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going to have their life
dreams dashed of owning a store,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the state doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the market doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the market does it, it's okay for
that to happen for the market to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that store, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not okay for the state to do that to
people because we're all equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should all have equal opportunity and
it shouldn't be who got here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not taking any more applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's cockamamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cockamamie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the other thing that I have to say
about that is that, you know, you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody says you have to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is farming is
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very risky business and
there's, you know, environmental things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, of course, when you have a
great crop, the price goes down because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody says farmers have to make a
profit, but everybody should be allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they want to farm, everybody should
be allowed to farm as long as they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: proper farming land or proper area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody disagree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Brendan Kennedy said the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's, anybody who's read
Marijuana Grower's Handbook, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody here has, if you haven't,
you should immediately go out and pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: a copy and read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in it, there's a, there's a page about
the tomato model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with tomatoes, there are large
tomato growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are small tomato growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are international companies,
national companies, regional companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: local farms, and neighbor sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's doing okay with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it could be like that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not opposed to giant corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that we should allow all
corporations and all people to do whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they want in marijuana, as long as they're
following the rules and doing it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rules should allow them to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody disagree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what we have to fight for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're not getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of the laws do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the state legislators who are so
in favor of capitalism, except when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in California, no
profit-making dispensaries are allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No profit-making dispensaries,
but it's such a capitalist state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine if they had said,
okay, no computers are so important to
[SPEAKER_00]: society that we shouldn't allow any of
these companies to make a profit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think how far advanced, much further
advanced, we would have been with
[SPEAKER_00]: computers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we would have been up to 128,
not billion, but millions, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think that marijuana has to become
totally civil, and we have to get the cops
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it, and we have to get the
legislators out of it, to the extent that
[SPEAKER_00]: they allow a free market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, we also have to
make sure that people have the ability and
[SPEAKER_00]: the right to use marijuana as they like,
so that we can change society and become a
[SPEAKER_00]: more loving group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal, in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ed, for all your service,
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more.
Thank you.
