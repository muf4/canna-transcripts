[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I have two special guests that have
already been on the show before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Uncle Rick, Mr. Richard DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you guys for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Steve, as you guys probably know,
he's the founder of Harborside,
[SPEAKER_02]: last prisoner project.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been on a bunch of documentaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one project after the next,
you've done a lot over the last 40 years
[SPEAKER_02]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've also done a lot over the last
40 years for the plant in other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here and an honor to
be here with Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I think it's more like 50 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 years for this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I sold my first bag of wheat when
I was 13 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 65 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember the wheat, the specific
strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it was just Mexican wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican brick wheat, that was basically
all that was available then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought a nickel bag that I rolled it
into six joints and sold each joint for a
[SPEAKER_01]: buck and did that a few times and
eventually started buying ounces and that
[SPEAKER_01]: led to greater things over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to Harborside.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Harborside eventually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty wild, long, strange trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long, strange trip and a
wonderful one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and then Rick, you did 32 years
plus you did another five year stint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, I did 32 calendar straight in
Waxman Security Prison, state of Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you were over a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Non-violent charge over marijuana only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the worst part, you didn't get caught
for doing it, you got stitched off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, they never put their hands on me
with products.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all a premeditated deal by the
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to go after you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 32 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then when I met your son,
this is in 2000, I think 11, and your son,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's your biggest advocate and said,
my father's going to get out of prison
[SPEAKER_02]: soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, him and my nephew Kenneth and
my daughter Ashley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time I heard of you
was in 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally came home in 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took much more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my children and my nephew,
which I call my son too, they were at it
[SPEAKER_03]: for 17 plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as soon as last prisoners project
got involved, it wasn't eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was home, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It went pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so rapid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't know if I was ready,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've been able to enjoy cannabis
quite a bit, and you have your own
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis brand, Delicioso.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our own brand in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with Truleaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in 130 stores in the state of
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's so unbelievable that I'm
actually selling at legal in the state
[SPEAKER_03]: that put me away for 98.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's what's pretty wild about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't have no beef about it or
any, you know, they don't even,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to get clemency since
I've been home or a pardon or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and because it's state, you can't
get a presidential.
[SPEAKER_03]: The president can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be, it's got to be Ron
DeSantis to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whoever replaces him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whoever replaces him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not big on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's not big on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not big on cannabis in a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could expect DeSantis to,
to probably attack cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so Steve, how did you guys first
meet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you guys have known each other for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when I met you, you were talking
about Richard and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was through Rick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was, it was, um, uh,
I think, uh, I was late to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was like 2012 or 2013,
something like that, that I actually got
[SPEAKER_01]: an Instagram account up and it was
somewhere in those first, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: year or two after I had an Instagram
account that Rick reached out to me and
[SPEAKER_01]: told me the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, uh, even before we started
last prisoner project that I think we
[SPEAKER_01]: started having that conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, for me, it was around 2017
that I really started thinking about last
[SPEAKER_01]: prisoner project in a serious way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we just passed adult use cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016, but not a single person got released
from prison as a result of passing that
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I felt like the next step was,
was actually doing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, from the beginning,
uh, Richard was on the list of prisoners
[SPEAKER_01]: that I cared about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause I remember, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm 10 years behind Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like the big glamorous airplane
flying boat captain and weed smuggler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was bringing in these huge loads of
amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like this, you know,
young dealer who was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving 50 pound lots and a hundred pound
lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was lucky, I, you know,
I could catch something on an offload
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, from a big smuggler,
but that was kind of like my role model
[SPEAKER_01]: and who I wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remembered so well when the federal
government started going after all the big
[SPEAKER_01]: smugglers and laying down these Rico
charges and these, you know, 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, 40, 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: 98 year sentences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and it was then that we really
knew that like the war was on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what year was that roughly?
[SPEAKER_01]: The time I remember that beginning is when
Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980,
[SPEAKER_01]: he appointed George HW Bush, the drug czar
of the South Florida task force.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they were the first people to put
us military AWACS up in the air to start
[SPEAKER_01]: patrolling the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so what they did is they,
in that time, there was a bunch of really
[SPEAKER_01]: great Colombian weed that was coming in
just phenomenal weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was coming in, in these great big boat
loads of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could like go 12 miles outside of
the, the coastal waterway in Florida and
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little cabin cruiser.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would just be like six or seven
ships there that you could buy weed off
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was really quite incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for a while, um, Bush went in and
targeted the big slow moving wheat chips
[SPEAKER_01]: and that allowed all of his Cuban buddies
who had, you know, operated with them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Bay of pigs and other, you know,
a fascist kind of undercover operations to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in as much Coke as they wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the beginning of the crack
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when they started putting
away people like Richard for decades.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Richard, you got a lot of good stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been able to hang out with you for
the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've, I've heard some amazing stories
that I wasn't able to get on the show the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time, but yeah, um, stories about
hanging out with the grateful dead stories
[SPEAKER_02]: about partying in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we got some of those on,
but let's talk a little bit about some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the smuggling that you've done and some of
the good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always a good time smuggling as
long as you got home and everybody was
[SPEAKER_03]: safe and no one got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: That made it a good time, you know,
as far as the, the business part of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would, that was a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it, cause I met so many people,
I met so many people and so many
[SPEAKER_03]: characters through, through my,
through my years of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the closest call of a load
that actually did make it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean, you mean like a close call?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one that almost didn't make it,
but it made it the first deal I ever did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Jamaica on a diving deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be, that's what I told
my dad only, you know, because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: tell my father what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, you know, this guy's got a boat
and my father knew who the guy was and he
[SPEAKER_03]: wants me to go and take care of the engine
on the boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I wound up, you know,
going and down and doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first year that was in like
1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, in 1970, you could drive a
boat right up to the back of the house and
[SPEAKER_03]: unload and no one even suspected anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, on the three bridges,
you know, at three bridges around the
[SPEAKER_03]: corners, you know, and we unloaded it
right at my friend's backyard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the canals and laying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a regular, full loaded there and
popping them actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember like, you know, going to
those houses, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and like picking up a
hundred lots from these houses that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be right on the canals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in those days, just bring the
boats right, right into the backyard of
[SPEAKER_01]: the houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the canals.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had, we had a rope going,
one rope going down, tying the bells
[SPEAKER_03]: inside of, inside of sale bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the weed tucked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we didn't want to really make it
look crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody did see it and we just keep
on pulling them up and they'd put them in
[SPEAKER_03]: the garage and then a truck would back in
the van and showed a van up and the van
[SPEAKER_03]: would drive away and another van would
come in, fill the van up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another van would drive away and one would
go, you know, they would all go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything would get weighed at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it would go into, into cars and
then it would go on the auto train or go
[SPEAKER_03]: up to New York or wherever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: New York and Chicago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then you started out in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ended up in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a plantation in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a little bit, coffee house or coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffee plantation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened was me and my brother were
driving around with them one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we got involved actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we stopped in a 7-Eleven on Sample
Road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I seen the car trader and on the front
page of the car trader had a house for
[SPEAKER_03]: sale, a coffee plantation for sale in
Columbia with beautiful two story house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I asked, I bought the magazine and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Asked the girl behind the counter if she
could please sell me a roll of quarters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went outside and my brother said,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, we're going to buy this house in
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fucking thought I was crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six days later, we had the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't even have passports when I
took the paper off the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, what we did was we went and bought
tickets to go to Columbia without
[SPEAKER_03]: passports because you do it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought two tickets for Columbia and we
went to the passport office.
[SPEAKER_03]: We left the airport, went to the passport
office and said to the passport office,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen, one of, one of our family
members died in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get down there right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had our passports in two hours and 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't happen like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get out when I came out from prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Took me 26 days to get my passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people it's taken a year and a
half, two years to get passports now,
[SPEAKER_01]: even people without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Permanent issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys remember a time, and this is
before my time where you used to walk
[SPEAKER_02]: through and there was no airport security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you an interesting story
about the, one of my earliest arrests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time when you could just get
on an airplane with weed or, or cash and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go from point A to point B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was working out of New York,
bringing loads from New York down to DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was working for one particular
character who has actually been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: news recently, but I'm not going to name
his name, um, who, um, desperately needed
[SPEAKER_01]: the $26,000 that I owed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like so desperately that he couldn't wait
for me to take the train the next morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to fly there on the last flight out
from Washington, DC to New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I stick the cash in it,
in a briefcase, cause that's all you had
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrapped it up in like a little satin
sheet or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to the airport and there's this
machine at the gate that I'd never seen
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a metal detector and they had this
sign up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, this is this new machine to
protect metal detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, if you, you know,
you are not any under obligation to
[SPEAKER_01]: consent to a search.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put your bag in here and it,
and it alerts, you can either choose to
[SPEAKER_01]: take your bag and leave the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we can search it and you can board the
plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stupidly allowed the bag to go
through the, the, the detector.
[SPEAKER_01]: It alerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, and they did not give me the
option of leaving the airport,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they arrested me and they seized all
of the cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that was, uh, that my first
federal conviction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually my first and only federal
conviction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had Rick who, uh, was loading
the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many pounds per load would you guys
take typically?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in the, in the beginning and then
at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning, um, I guess the first
load I did was, um, 450 in the C plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said something to my brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Hey, listen, we, we should
definitely get our own transportation
[SPEAKER_03]: because we were having problems with the,
we did like, two or three deals with,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, with, uh, with the sea planes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy, um, he stepped, he stepped to
my friend when we weren't around and he
[SPEAKER_03]: said, Hey, listen, I don't want,
you know, I don't want to work with these
[SPEAKER_03]: guys and, and, uh, I want to do something
with just me, you know, me and you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy says, no, no, we can't do
nothing with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't ever even, you can't ever work
for the leases again for trying to sell
[SPEAKER_03]: behind their back.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, this is my Colombian buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this guy was like with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the end of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was two or three people to try
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you take them from New York,
you bring them down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You showed them the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they go down there by themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think they can, they think they can
repeat it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they got some cash, but I don't
know if you know, Colombian people are
[SPEAKER_03]: very loyal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very loyal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once they hook, hook with somebody and
they see that you're a family type of
[SPEAKER_03]: person and you're, you're about making
money and making sure that everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way that they're leaving you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the years I've had my experiences
with that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end I was bringing,
you know, like 22,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd load on a DC six, DC four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, you know, like two half tractor
trailers forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We load the trailers with, uh,
you know, half weed and half plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The back part of the trailer would be
loaded with plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Front part of the trailer would be loaded
with weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 10 tons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually like 10,000 pounds in the front
of both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were just like, you know,
these incredible like modern day pirate
[SPEAKER_01]: heroes, man, who were like making it
through all the radar, beating the code.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast guard, beating the U S army,
um, uh, and doing these incredible,
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weed was just, you know,
it was extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was buying probably some of the
weed that Richard smuggled into New York
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was, uh, I paid $350 a pound for
it, which was $200 a pound more than I was
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for Mexican weed at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was this just extraordinarily
light gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say gold, it was like the gold
and the logo on your cap, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with these dark, dark seeds in it and
just a terpene profile, this piney,
[SPEAKER_01]: joyous, amazing terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just some of the very best weed
that I've ever, ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I haven't experienced true
Colombian gold ever in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked Colombian genetics,
Santa Marta gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some really amazing stuff down
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the effect is always really
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've smoked the genetics to the
claim that they're the real Santa Marta
[SPEAKER_01]: gold, but I smoked the real Santa Marta
gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, maybe those genetics are the
same, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a method of harvesting and a
method of curing that has unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: been lost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they dried it and the way they
cured it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a very important part of the deal
with the gold too on how you dried it and
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sadly has been, has been lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's going to take some
enterprising, uh, creative, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: young people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they're already working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've met some of them in Columbia who
are working to figure out how to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that type of cannabis back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was done once, it can be done
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, re what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reland racing the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reland racing the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geoclimatizing the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geoclimatizing the world, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that concept of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just so, so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to go back to the roots,
you know, where we came from and add
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we shouldn't be afraid of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, especially with cannabis,
the problem with, uh, what's going on now
[SPEAKER_02]: is we're bottlenecking all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like gelato, it's very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows gelato, but, uh,
we get these guys crossing a gelato with
[SPEAKER_02]: the gelato and they're genetically,
they're almost identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you're doing is actually
taking away from the genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking away from the vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we need to incorporate and not be
afraid to incorporate other things that
[SPEAKER_02]: might not be popular for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen to the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant is incredible because you can
put her anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a few generations, she will
acclimatize herself to that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: micro climate and start producing more
optimal expressions of, of, of that
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic underlying genetic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way that is much more rapid and
efficient than most other plants around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant herself is calling upon us to
plant her in different places,
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what happens and to honor and
respect each of those varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, one of the things we always
tried to do at Harborside was to create an
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing role for the small grower and,
and particularly for sun grown growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, one of the things that's
still being worked on in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think should be a feature of the
cannabis industry globally is
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachians, just like you have
Appalachians of origin for wine and for
[SPEAKER_01]: some types of cheese and other
agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that for cannabis and Appalachians
of origin that, you know, require the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds to be actually grown in the soil and
underneath the sun of that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: micro climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter what the genetics
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something and grow it in one place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go sometimes as, as little as five
miles and get a completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go a thousand miles and you
wouldn't even recognize it as the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, and that's the beauty of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's all these
environmental variables add to not only
[SPEAKER_02]: the story, but the amazing qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very, you can get these unique
expressions and some stuff is meant to be
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in the islands and some stuff is
meant to be grown coastal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, I big on exploring what
should be grown where, and with all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different genetic lines, being able to go
test out in these places and see what does
[SPEAKER_02]: better in what place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that's the beauty
of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the islands, like the
Hawaiian islands, they would rather,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants would rather grow on the ground
than inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, inside grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see one net.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see one inside grow all the time
I was there and I seen three different
[SPEAKER_03]: grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's be clear about why we
started growing weed indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started growing weed indoors because
the government started sending helicopters
[SPEAKER_01]: and found our outdoor farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't because we thought we were going
to grow much better weed in North.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that was contrary to the hippie
ethic of doing things as naturally as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we possibly could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the actual real reality is that you
will never, no matter what light is
[SPEAKER_01]: created, be able to get the kind of
fullness of terpene expression that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get under the sun from an artificial
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, uh, that, that,
that we were right then, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that moving forward, this is why
Appalachians are so important,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That once we really do go through this
process of re land racing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and, and geo climatizing,
geo climatizing strains for the ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: micro climates, and then protecting them
with Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the most desirable
weed, not some weed that was grown in a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room that you could grow that exact
same weed with that exact same expression
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Optimizing those environments with,
yeah, optimizing the cannabis for those
[SPEAKER_02]: environments and finding out what works
the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and exploring those,
you know, those, those, uh, those paths
[SPEAKER_02]: with different genetics and really see
what performs best in what region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there, there, and there's,
there's a lot of mystery there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of mystery to be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's, it's amazing because
all the genetics we're working with came
[SPEAKER_02]: from six things, you know, the six,
six regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically everything that we have that
we're smoking today, the modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much came from these six plants or
six regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I would imagine that there are parts of
this globe, uh, that have, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been very difficult to get to
because of civil conflict and other
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons where there are still other basic
building block varieties of cannabis yet
[SPEAKER_01]: to be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Infinite fun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother nature was so wise and generous
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different possible
combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: and flavonoids that it's just this
treasure chest that we are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up and playing with both from a
spiritual point of view and a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical point of view for as long
as I could imagine in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me how cannabis benefited your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It paid my bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to grow my, my name,
Delicioso on my corporation, I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredibly fast now, because I think
people are realizing the people to put the
[SPEAKER_03]: work in before was just, you know,
you could come with money and do it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we do, we set the groundwork and
we, we, we made sure that when we did it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it was going to stay around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't, we didn't do it just for the
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it forever and I'll be doing this
till I die.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you were meant to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was meant to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, cowboys were meant to be
gunslingers and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I w I was meant to be a smuggler.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was, it was, it was part of my
bloodline that my grandfather was a
[SPEAKER_03]: bootlegger.
[SPEAKER_03]: My father worked for my grandfather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look down to generation to
generation, someone in my father's family
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to be not legitimate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, that happened to be me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, I'd been doing this since I was
like, I guess, 14, you know, it was 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 14 years old and, and I was in the
business big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I was 18, four years later,
I was, you know, driving like brand new
[SPEAKER_03]: cars and, you know, beautiful apartments
and no one knew where I was so on the
[SPEAKER_03]: cover, they were like, how is this guy got
two motorcycles, you know, a Harley and a
[SPEAKER_03]: Triumph, you know, brand new, you know,
it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was, it was like, it was like,
it just a smooth, you know, it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could give someone a million dollars
worth of weed and shake their hand and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, man, I'll see you in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have to give me anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just drop by drop off like 18,000 pounds
and 18,000 pounds would be over a million.
[SPEAKER_03]: A million probably, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would just shake their hand and that
was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, it's like, you know, you can't do
that no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're with, with people that you
grew up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said yesterday, I'm with my
friends that I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only people that I could really trust
is the people that I grew up with and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some great people like I met now,
like Steve and people like you that I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't, you know, they know, they know that
they know I ain't saying anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If a cop grabs me and tells me,
yeah, you know, you're going to get 80
[SPEAKER_03]: years, but I'm going to give you two if
you're just telling me about the guy down
[SPEAKER_03]: the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell them, Hey man, you go talk to the
guy down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't talk to me about him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way everybody's getting in
trouble now is they just give up people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they don't know what they're,
what they're involved in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I always sat my guys down before
we did a deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you know, I'm going to go do this
deal now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are going to make, you know,
you're going to unload the plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all going to make 25 brand for half
hour work or 50 grand for half hour work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a consequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get caught, you're going to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously a lot of people don't do
that, especially people from South
[SPEAKER_03]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, after spending the first 30 years
of my cannabis career in the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: market, where, you know, routinely
millions and millions of dollars traded on
[SPEAKER_01]: a handshake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, occasionally things went
sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: People went bad on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually it was rare that people went
into a deal with you like that with the
[SPEAKER_01]: intention of ripping you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was usually because something happened
to them and there was a cascade of
[SPEAKER_01]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really shocked when I started
sitting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing mainstream business and actually
having written contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, those guys are the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see, I thought that the contract was
actually this attempt to come to a mutual
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement where everybody would understand
what the terms were.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be very clear with each other so
that you would avoid conflict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I learned that there's this whole
cadre of mainstream business that writes
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts deliberately so that they can
set you up to be screwed a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: later down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use the most obfuscating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confusing, unclear kind of language as
they possibly can and then rely on the
[SPEAKER_01]: courts to enforce some kind of unfair
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, I was shocked that
people would choose to spend their lives
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you could do business
honestly with people and shake their hands
[SPEAKER_01]: and write good about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you going to spend your time
writing up all of these bullshit contracts
[SPEAKER_01]: designed to cheat people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, nowadays you want to work with
people that you could do a handshake with.
[SPEAKER_02]: A handshake deal and you need a contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like because it's just it's there's a
lot of bad actors out there and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: bad people, you know, and it's people that
are in it for the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when it was more dangerous and
there was more consequences on the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: side, there was a different crowd of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to have some balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't about how good is your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, OK, we're going to commit to
doing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if you got money, you could pay to
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pay to play sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't realize the importance of
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another issue with the industry
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you guys both understand
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve and Harborside had some amazing
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that have seen the
Harborside of today, it's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: Harborside that I grew up knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Harborside I grew up knowing was the
place that set the standard for clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanted good clones, Harborside had
the best clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the best quality.
Darkheart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, Darkheart had the best clones,
you know, and Harborside, they sold
[SPEAKER_02]: Darkheart clones, but you would take them
and they were picture perfect clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: they had perfect roots and you guys would
reject tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember going to Harborside and
it's like if you wanted flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had all different tiers of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the top shelf back in the day,
you wanted some Chem 91, some Sage and
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanted some good top shelf flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was available there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff was better on average than
you could find in most dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_02]: California today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most results flow out of intention,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And our intention was to create a temple
for cannabis and a community space for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we found ourselves in this
very fortunate place in California where
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, you know, still a gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't fully legal by law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big corporations didn't want to
come in and we had this breathing room and
[SPEAKER_01]: we created this really amazing system,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody made intergenerational wealth or
not very many people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody in that system from 1996
until 2018 was taking care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers could afford to buy the land they
were growing on and send their kids to
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients could come into dispensaries and
get the very best weed in the world at
[SPEAKER_01]: really affordable prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who worked in dispensaries had the
best jobs that they'd ever had in their
[SPEAKER_01]: lives, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was well taken care of in that
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was counties in the Emerald
Triangle that their whole economy was
[SPEAKER_02]: based on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the whole economy, all of it,
everything, you know, if you lived up
[SPEAKER_02]: there, if you didn't participate,
your spouse, your neighbor, the kids you
[SPEAKER_02]: went to school with, their parents did,
I mean, it was such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that's kind of changed,
unfortunately, because a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: people were the ones that helped build the
industry as it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, guys like Richard, we got the
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think I've done my part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been around since the 90s
and very passionate about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, and it's a group effort
from so many people in so many directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we were at dinner last
night talking about how tough times are
[SPEAKER_02]: and how, you know, for me, it's all about
being grateful for where we're at and what
[SPEAKER_02]: we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you start getting too caught up on
the bad part, you forget how, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're living in a time that weed is,
marijuana is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, yeah, it's pretty much legal,
federally, whatever, but you can go on the
[SPEAKER_02]: joint, you can smoke a joint on the street
and they're not going to give you shit for
[SPEAKER_02]: it too often.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get locked up over a
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's this incredible, in my opinion,
spiritual revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're undergoing now where literally
hundreds of millions of people all around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world have been called into
conversations with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of those conversations,
we have learned the same lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of those lessons, we've built a
common value system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So wherever we are in the world,
we value creativity over conformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We value individual freedom over
submission to authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: We value nature over industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We value peace over war.
[SPEAKER_01]: We value love over hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that every living creature and
every inanimate object made by nature has
[SPEAKER_01]: a place and a purpose in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever language we speak, whatever race
we are, whatever religion we follow around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, plant people follow that same
path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's this incredible time where we
now have the opportunity to introduce
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about it, it's like,
we've all been called, we've all been
[SPEAKER_01]: called by the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's she want us to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you listen, the plant will tell
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant will put you in the right direction
if you listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the reason that governments and
religions are so terribly terrified of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we engage with that
conversation with cannabis, it is a direct
[SPEAKER_01]: conduit to mother nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a direct conduit to the divine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the messages that we receive from
mother nature, from the divine carry a
[SPEAKER_01]: greater authority than any manmade
authority will ever have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why authoritarians have always
been so hostile towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've been in Hawaii lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about Hawaiian weed a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it over in Hawaii?
[SPEAKER_03]: My son lives in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he moved to Hawaii, I said to him,
well, how do you like it?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, dad, I moved from the swamp to
paradise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I've been to Hawaii a few
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent some time there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived there for about six, seven months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never did any time in Maui, but this
time I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted to make sure that I seen
most of the great things that it offers
[SPEAKER_03]: the island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, I mean, I went fishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We caught like over 500 pounds of
yellowtail tuna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we went hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a Angus cow, 300 pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could have got a 1500 pound if
we wanted to, but we only had a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time to clean it because I had
to come to California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were, and I met this great
guy, Patrick, that's got a farm there,
[SPEAKER_03]: which he met him like a semi-accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost that they met each other and
the people that worked for him and the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that took us hunting and Patrick
took us fishing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite an experience Hawaii this
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a whole new deal for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you said you saw some sour diesel
there, that was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottom of the leafs were purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I lifted the leaf up, I said,
holy cow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I want some of this right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, you know, it won't be ready
for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wound up getting a few things from him
before I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jason Harris, he's over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what happened was I'm there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm talking to my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, Hey, that Maui Waui
is... So I said, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring something back for you guys,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So interesting enough, I got Maui Waui
when I was in my teens, probably 16 years
[SPEAKER_02]: old or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got this Maui Waui that came in and
it was velvety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lime green and it was velvety,
like spongy, velvety, but it was part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it definitely would lift you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effect is what I remember the
most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really remember how it tasted,
but I remember the way it looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was like... Remember how super
sticky it was?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really remember the spell though,
but I do remember the way it made me feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was super, super uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was strong, but uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it's a happy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very first, um, what we called then
Sinsemea, the very first domestically
[SPEAKER_01]: grown weed that was good, as opposed to
what we used to call gronies or homegrown,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was really, really badly grown weed
in the beginning, um, was in 1974 in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York city when I bought a pound of Maui
Waui for $1,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it was like this incredible
sticker shock, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, I was used to paying 300 or
350 for the Colombians.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like $1,200 for a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't care how good this weed
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paying $1,200 a pound for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the pound was put in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I did end up buying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York has always been infamous for the
expensive town prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's playing a role in what's
happening in New York right now and the
[SPEAKER_01]: difficulty of, uh, of getting a workable
legal system in New York, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause New York has always been the place
where if you had a load of really good
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, you take it to New York,
cause you're going to get top dollar and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to turn it fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, always good in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no place that you could move
weed like you, like you could in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consequently, New Yorkers got used to
having the best weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it was a competitive
environment, they ended up paying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, high prices, but not ridiculous
prices where it became very particular
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that whole network that was
developed to serve those consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is now the legacy market in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got a bunch of, um,
MSOs who really don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis who are now trying to compete
with that network with weed that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's not going too well for them
so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most of your weed was moved in New
York, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some in Miami, some other place,
but New York was the... I didn't sell any
[SPEAKER_03]: weed in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: None in Florida?
[SPEAKER_03]: None.
[SPEAKER_02]: All in New York?
[SPEAKER_03]: They either went to New York or Chicago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to sell weed in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to sell the whole load for 250 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you took 18,000 pounds,
you pay 250.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, if you're a kid that grew up
with me, which the guy that used to take
[SPEAKER_03]: the big load, he grew up with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if say like, like my next door
neighbor wanted 250, I'd give him,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give him 250 pounds for $250 a pound
just because, you know, or one of my
[SPEAKER_03]: friends that might've been a fireman or a
cop in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give them 250 a pound, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then, so your price was what,
a hundred?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're, you're doubling it,
you're 2.5X or what was your cost?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe 30 bucks a pound or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, it was like $8 a pound or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, cause we had to just figure,
we had to figure the guy, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to plant to the guy that's watching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we figured it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't, we just figured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's going to cost to grow this
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to cost us 20 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That fields 30,000 pound field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it deep and long, you know,
I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when, when you break it down,
if you're getting 30,000 pounds and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: only paying 20 grand, what are you
actually paying for each pound?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You, if you break it down all the way,
it's like, it was peanuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like pennies on a dollar type of
thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay more money to, to bribe the people
they need to bribe to get the load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it used to cost me 30 grand just
to get out to the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be driving along and there'd be a,
there'd be an army stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I jump out of the truck with a shoe box
for 500 pesos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I say, Wahaka what comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the first thing that comes to mind
for you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the, it's the most indigenous
state in Mexico and.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, that was the best, the best
smoke to come out of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wahaka was the best ever smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part was I had the connection
when I was 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wise guys in New York had the
connection and my friend knew the wise
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go over to the Manhattan beach hotel
and I'd buy pounds of a Hawkin for 20
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks a piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: In New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in the early sixties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But 20 bucks a piece, but I had to buy a
whole suitcase, you know, like 20 of them
[SPEAKER_03]: or 30 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had that connection back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it was, and, and you know,
we would sell them for like, 150.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was paying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I got a pound of Mexican in Washington,
DC for 120 bucks, I was thrilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was paid 150, I was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to pay 160 or 165, I was kind of
not so happy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I mean, the people that I would sell
to 250, like my friend, he would double
[SPEAKER_03]: his money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was a Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would, he would double his money.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd buy it for 250 a pound and he'd sell
it for 500.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I dropped a few ounces for three here
and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he tried me on the twigs and the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Oh yeah, I'd like 80 pounds of
seeds and twigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, well, knock it off the bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did they do the brickweed?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did I brick it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you brick it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two book presses that I bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought in New York, put on an airplane
and sent down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Book presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Book presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, I would do like, they were this
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the two regular Colombian bells
were like that and about that high,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were that long, about that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess about, yeah, about that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was 20 pounds pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I wrapped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrapped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd be wrapped in a brown paper with a
little plastic around them and it'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: stacked into the burlap bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be like perfectly,
you know, the burlap size.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Mexico, we used to, we had built boxes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the size that we wanted the bales to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd use auto jacks and put the
jacks in and then we use hydraulic jacks
[SPEAKER_01]: to press the, the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then do the, and then do the
wrapping and the price of the weed but
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that, or at least, you know,
I would take the same weed and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: press it in three different levels of
pressing and they would end up selling it
[SPEAKER_01]: at three different prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the pillow press was just like
barely compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds were still really, really nice,
but took up a lot of space in the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the price was higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could like compress it down
and get it to like half of that size,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could just smash the shit out of it
and get it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the, that was the problem
with the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you got Jamaican, it was never
pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was loose in the bow, you know,
it was bow stuffed with by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a bell like this big was like 40,
45 pounds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the quality of the Jamaican stuff was
really good or no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really said Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had to rate the different
regions, how would you rate the top?
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian being the top?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai would be the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thai would be the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then depending on the era, Jamaican or
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning, there was a time when
there was good Jamaican that was better
[SPEAKER_01]: than most of the Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, the Mexicans got much
better at growing good weed while the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican is kind of stagnated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jamaicans have improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have improved, but still most people
I know who go to Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could bring their own weed with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: De-oriental people in Jamaica are the ones
that got the weed up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got the quality to weed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly Chinese people growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing about Jamaica is it's,
you know, usually thought of as just this
[SPEAKER_01]: black nation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it actually, you know, has all
different kinds of cultural strains from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them have dabbled in cannabis
here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, all around the world,
the quality of cannabis is increasing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the knowledge is more freely
available now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, there are, you know,
there's lots of Jamaican farmers who would
[SPEAKER_01]: love to be visited by some good American
growers and have some lessons and put them
[SPEAKER_01]: to good use.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really interesting time
globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me jump back to the Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's talk about the Crippie a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your experience with the
Crippie?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even know if it's the same
thing we're talking about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Columbia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a region in Columbia where most
of the, where there's a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial weed production that's still
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a village called Toribio,
which is one of the centers of that
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Crippie basically is Dutch high breed
Indica's, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That were brought into a jungle
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they never would have naturally
adapted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a 12-12 environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, in order to get the buds to
flower, they're vegged under light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you turn off the light to get
them to start flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they lose about half of half to two
thirds to bud rot before they're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to cure it, because the
conditions in the jungle there are so
[SPEAKER_01]: humid, in order to cure it, they put it in
these ovens, these gas fired ovens,
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually basically cook the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this weed is shipped to Paraguay,
Uruguay, Brazil, and other markets in
[SPEAKER_01]: Latin America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So amongst my Colombian connoisseur,
cannabis friends, Crippie is a derogatory
[SPEAKER_01]: term, not a complimentary term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, they say fire now
or whatever the terms are for the hype,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hype stuff in the hype weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Crippie, to my knowledge from Mango
and from Craig Coffee from High Times that
[SPEAKER_02]: have both been on the show was,
that was the good stuff in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your experience with the
Crippie?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never could put a handle on it,
where to get it or find it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, there was never abundance
amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I know Chris,
you know, Chris the sunshine, sunshine,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, he's a real big Crippie guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's like, says like he started
Crippie, but we know that he didn't start
[SPEAKER_03]: Crippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he has, you know, his quality in
Crippie with true leaf is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, I never, I never could get
a handle on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wanted to, I wanted to,
you know, try to get my hands on like 50,
[SPEAKER_03]: a hundred pounds at a time of this stuff,
but I never seen it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never heard about Crippie until I went
to Columbia in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I'm talking about in the
seventies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you could light up a J and you
could smell it a block away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like it was so strong when you
rolled it in a room, you had to have the
[SPEAKER_03]: windows open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I saw plenty of weed like that,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was so serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like burnt tires.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been a pleasure having you.
