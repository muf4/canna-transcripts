[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, our special guest is Nick from Girl
World AG, founder of Canna Cribs,
[SPEAKER_01]: serial entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about doing this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm part of Girl World as an ambassador.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done amazing stuff with Girl World.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known about you since Canna Cribs.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Autumn did some Canna Cribs
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a host over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how we met originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe at MJ Biz a few years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of my favorite parts about
this industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all kind of meet each other,
you know, one person or even at MJ Biz at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just run into each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a tight knit group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: MJ Biz is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year was a really great MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it wasn't as well attended
maybe as some of the previous ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody that was there was serious
about doing business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like there was a focus on the
business side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a lot of window shoppers or
tire kickers because you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were people serious about doing
consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had a lot of great meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't just let's go to Vegas and
have fun, which that's I've had good times
[SPEAKER_01]: with that as well at MJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it was a lot more serious and the
quality of the people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got my start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016 at MJ Biz before when I was just
launching Growers Network, I think maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: we had launched that month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like around November at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to last year, so 2023,
they split the halls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all post harvest and more of
the bigger hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Cultivation was a smaller hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some people kind of got lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people thought it was just that one
hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, where's my favorite
lighting brand or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I definitely saw a drop off in
kind of foot traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with everything going on, I really do
hope that this year it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I don't know if I told you
this, but we have a massive community
[SPEAKER_00]: activation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're going to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to be doing some
podcast episodes with some big names
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been talking about doing a
dinner party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm just excited for Vegas this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've built this, you know,
we is in me part of this bigger network of
[SPEAKER_01]: people and yourself included.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this really amazing group of people,
hardworking individuals that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in their own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys have been a platform for
myself on our show and through social
[SPEAKER_01]: media, connecting me with guys like
Horizon Light Lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like one of many examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kana, Horizon Light Lift, Beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just came on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I would never have thought about
calling them up and asking them to come on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you offered this amazing platform,
which I've really benefited from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've mutually benefited from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just great because we have this
community of great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can I can just start shooting
off names like Sergio, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Matt from Terra International,
you know, these these great guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so many more just like
them that all have similar goals and see
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry through a similar lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, community is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first company I started
Growers Network, it was about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was community for people growing at
home and Grow World, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little bit more global as a community
and a little bit more on the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But same ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the right people in a safe
environment online and with Sergio's help
[SPEAKER_00]: in person with Connect events and just
step out of their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bring them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide a format and also help each other
monetize.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of my biggest challenges in
starting, you know, kind of going back
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016, 2017 in Canada Cribs days was
finding sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many years later, once I left and
started Grow World, I wanted to have
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like an agency right where we could
represent podcasts and Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: influencers and even garden tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we work with Justin and Jeremy
at Growing Exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just bringing different people
together and helping them do business
[SPEAKER_00]: together is what we specialize in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, highlighting what they do best,
which is so great, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you get your start in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pretty amazing journey you've
been on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm 31 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started at the age of 23 and I'm going
to bring you way, way, way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to the University of
Arizona I had all these bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurial endeavors pre-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you get in, you never get
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a bunch of companies in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a entrepreneurship ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about junior, sophomore, junior year,
I entered into this place called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pirate Mansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost like a commune of crazy
people like myself that wanted to work
[SPEAKER_00]: until 3, 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe not go to the bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually build something with our
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had about 18 entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Sunday we would have an open house.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would come kind of pitch their
company and get feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I was like 19-ish,
20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was modeled actually after a place
not too far away from here called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainbow Mansion in San Francisco,
where Facebook, Google, all these big tech
[SPEAKER_00]: would send their like kind of first year
freshmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally heard about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved into this house and that's
where I met my last business partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate Lipton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was just starting Growers House at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was finishing school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had worked at a drone company,
again, like the furthest away from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were building fleet management software
for drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that kind of went got to a place
where I'm like, yeah, I don't really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to drop out and move to Silicon Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather just stay, finish school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, it was around my senior
year now, and I was roommates with Nate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nate was building up Growers House,
this e-commerce website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's not familiar, they have
everything under the sun for your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an online hydro store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking about building a
community for the people that shopped at
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers House.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really the early beginnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, we talked about it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the turning point for me is I met
his father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his father was like a 70 year old
serial entrepreneur from Brooklyn,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like super strong character.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's Paulie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had built up this massive kind of
e-commerce before e-commerce was a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: type company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I was finishing
up during my senior year and I was best
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with Nate, met his dad and I was
like, I think he can mentor me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can learn a lot from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually decided to stay in Tucson,
build GrowersNetwork.org from the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: up within kind of as like a sister company
to Growers House because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about a year into that, James,
I started Canicribbs as a way to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic, like internally as a way to drive
traffic to Growers House and Growers
[SPEAKER_00]: Network, externally, of course,
to educate, show all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: technology and ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canicribbs is a special show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of really set the bar for what
could be done within the realm of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: using social media, using that platform,
highlighting growers and the garden tours
[SPEAKER_01]: were amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you built it up and sold it,
which is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 2021, mind you, we had some
partners in the business that were with
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulie for 2021, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind of getting 74, 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was kind of his time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate and myself were, I was like 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Nate was like 31 at the time,
my age now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as a group, we thought it
would be the right time around 2020 to
[SPEAKER_00]: start looking at bringing on some outside
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, to provide a liquidity event for
some of the partners that maybe wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: cash in their chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two, to really accelerate the
growth of our business lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time we had Grower's House,
Grower's Network, Canicribbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of like the content and
community that drove the commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was symbiotic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So around 2021 was the time that we
brought on two outside private equity
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, I mean, honestly, I go back to
age because I'm so blessed to have learned
[SPEAKER_00]: these lessons early on and have gone
through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some entrepreneurs go their whole
life going to a sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're way too young to have done
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't have wanted to change
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I kind of have, you know,
everything in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have really strong partnerships all
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, my entire film crew came with
me to Grow World.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually created a new show where we
get to travel around the world and show
[SPEAKER_00]: off the different cannabis communities
that are kind of pushing that envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you went to one of my favorite
countries, Colombia, recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to have a couple
podcasts to dive into all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we specifically went to Bogota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to the city and then just north,
like Nemocon or Tocancipa area,
[SPEAKER_00]: like five hours north of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filmed FolioMed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filmed Tarkus, which is an extraction
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one of the top extraction labs
in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clever Leafs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this massive facility and then
Plena Global.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a really good spectrum of the
different types of growers out in that
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, one of the biggest things that
I think we learned as an entire film crew
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we are kind of showing the world
is that Colombia doesn't have a domestic
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even just on the drive over here,
I spotted like two or three dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Colombia, it's 100 percent for
export.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was fascinating to me because you
walk downtown and everyone's smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's having a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different like tolerance zones,
as they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even some kind of like Spanish
social club vibes going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to one of them to film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of passionate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of people that are super
passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was at MJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke at MJ Biz in Colombia a few years
back and I've toured over there at Earth's
[SPEAKER_01]: Healing and some other places in Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had really good experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an amazing experience when I was
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a really welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they really welcome Californians
and people from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're just super passionate about
the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, you know, it's amazing
seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of it reminds me of the
early days of Prop 250.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that a lot, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of see ourselves as gringos up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost like time travelers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going down there and letting them
know like, hey, this is what the future is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also flip roses moved from California
down to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were in the rose producing region
of Colombia and all the surrounding farms
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to one called Folio Med was
one of the largest rose growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they shared a lot of employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shared cultivation styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a big takeaway for me,
James, was that potentially we're pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: bullish on this, but the future of
Colombian cannabis will be consumed right
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those growers out there that I
just spent the last seven, eight years
[SPEAKER_00]: filming through canner cribs and deep
roots with autumn, a lot of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, should be asking the big question
about what's next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to differentiate us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we were talking about this
earlier and I've been chatting with Sergio
[SPEAKER_00]: the past couple of days a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe the future of the American
market, genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I do what I do, because I
believe the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so many different
revenue streams within the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but genetics and even within genetics,
there's different revenue streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's licensing, you know,
there's nursery, there's the nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: model, there's the seed, tissue culture
can be under the same category.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is going to come down to that's
going to separate one person from the next
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be genetics and the quality of
genetics that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you staying on top of the trends
or are you going to fall behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: trends?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited about the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of people that are
very pessimistic, but I think we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting times, you know, and there's
so many different directions the market
[SPEAKER_01]: can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in a very unstable market and
I'm really looking forward to once we
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting a grasp on the stable
market, where the direction of the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics are going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: After Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one last note on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the GrowWorld platform,
we are allowing any member qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world to sample the menu from
these Colombian facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like as of right now, you can go sign
up for flour, different oils, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a qualified country that
can legally import and sell, you can test
[SPEAKER_00]: the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one of the reasons why we
created the GrowWorld Tour was to show off
[SPEAKER_00]: our members facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I was going with this is
upcoming, we have the Sacramento Tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flew in for this podcast and the
Sacramento Tour coming up in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to film the best of the best
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this is our almost like a
bittersweet farewell.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the American market from a filming
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, a lot of our crew still lives
here, but we're really looking at what's
[SPEAKER_00]: that global story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to Portugal in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're going to film the
iconic Spannabis event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you'll be out there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll do a dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a dinner again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do some amazing dinners and you'll get
to meet my amazing friends from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's in town for Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say all, but the majority of my
friends come in from all over the world to
[SPEAKER_01]: come hang out for a week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be out there for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be my first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be over my birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best events, if not the
best event of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I heard Germany is now
popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to hit Mary Jane too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going there in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing Vegas in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing Spannabis in kind of March,
February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're doing Germany in June with
Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're literally hitting the,
we're filming the three biggest markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and trade shows in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and they're all just going to keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed Germany this year and I'm sad
that I did, but I did it because I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on my facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm doing here, I think
supersedes everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this has to fall in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the genetics is first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I love Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to get seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to do an event with Sergio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a connect event out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do another one next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live stream that through Grow World.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was some really cool people that
showed up to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just can't speak highly enough
about Sergio and what he's done for the
[SPEAKER_01]: connect community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of us is being part of the
connect community, which I think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's able to highlight people in a way
that, you know, you get to see the good
[SPEAKER_01]: and the best, you know, within the
lighting industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the light, and then you can do
like, you're able to debate it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how he's able to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have competition,
but it's not really competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only in competition with ourselves
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of these guys will argue
that, but I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're talking market share,
they might argue it, but I feel like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only in competition with myself trying
to make better genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I do circles around genetics
and it points back to genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a breeding book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my resume, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you read that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know about me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go buy my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, we do tissue culture here,
but that's, that's basically so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: have clean genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we offer tissue culture services
through my partner, Justin at Apical
[SPEAKER_01]: Biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a value added service for the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, if you want us to bank your
genetics, you want us to clean and bank
[SPEAKER_01]: your genetics, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to breed with your genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we need to clean them first because
I want everything pest and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things are so important moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything, you know, and,
and being able to maintain the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: your genetics over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people are missing
that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are missing the step in
the phenohunting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not doing it at a big enough scale,
not testing it in enough environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then that's one of those things like,
what are you breeding for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what's the purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a solutions based?
[SPEAKER_01]: company or are you just breeding to breed
to make money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what differentiates the best
guys out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do similar things as myself in the sense
that they're looking for specific
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions to problems that we have in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I see the problems with pests and
pathogens and also genetics moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're crossing a whole bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do about 300 out-crosses a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within those 300 out-crosses,
we select a handful of those and offer
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the market, but we're constantly
testing and testing and testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also not just testing the plants,
but testing those plants in different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, testing them with different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the stuff that gets me excited
about coming to work every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wasn't able to do this, I would
probably do something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have a background in culinary
arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for Charles Schwab in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a whole bunch of different
things in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the thing that gets me the
most excited, you know, and, and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're on the forefront of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: All our friends are on the forefront of
the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, and it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, seeing guys like Kevin and Tim
over at Favin, you know, and what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at the R&D that they're doing,
and it gets me excited about doing R&D,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it's like talking to those
guys over in SAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, they're pushing the boundaries
on what you can do with R&D and really
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, they think of things
similar to how I do is where I'm not ever
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a, you know, some people
think it's a shitty thing that I'm never
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what I'm never happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always feel like even my book,
I'm like, I did a good job on my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a lot of time and energy,
but it could still be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything, if you look at it from
that lens where you don't settle for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you have, you look at ways you
can improve it to make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you become successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I preach to my team more than they'd
like to hear Kaizen, the Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophy of just constant
self-improvement, 1% better, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a genetic version of your book,
an event for Sergio, something that we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: an episode we're filming, just,
there's always room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that at the top, it's
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom, it's competition,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am extremely grateful that we've
made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the top of this market and we're
able to work with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter if there's two
growers side by side competing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: same market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're collaborating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trading genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trading, you know, cultivation
methodologies, new tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're jumping up on a panel at Connect
and sharing their findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when we work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see guys in Humboldt doing it like,
Huckleberry Hill Farms and Ridgeline,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they could be competent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could consider themselves
competition, but they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're creating genetics together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That community is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pushing forward, you know,
on the genetics, on the terroir,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the breeding side and doing it in their
environment up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a big fan of the whole Emerald
Triangle and what people are doing up
[SPEAKER_01]: there and how I can elevate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like being able to
collaborate with them, being able to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a Californian and as someone who has
respect for where this plant came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a lot of credit that
those guys should be getting for what they
[SPEAKER_01]: did in the legacy market, evolving into
what they're doing in the current market.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, each country we go
to to film, we kind of have a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaways to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why we're here right now is to tell
the epicenter, where it all started,
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture, the movement, the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way still comes from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say genetics are created
in a lot of places that are good now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the epicenter, there's a huge
concentration, especially this Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_01]: this part of the center of California,
because, you know, people call us Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, but we're still kind of in the
middle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But between LA and Seattle, I mean,
the West Coast, West Coast, best coast for
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are looking at everything that
we do and wanting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they don't even care what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want, you know, you see that in
Europe a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want the California weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not even grown in
California, but they want the California
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Colombia, one of the largest
facilities we went to tour Cleverleaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: they threw out, you know, this great
spread of their menu of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proudest genetics that they had
were from Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even one of their head growers had a
James Loud sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I texted you that photo on his phone that
they just picked up from Spannabis at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're at the epicenter up here and
the rest of the world wants to grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: our menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we are the ones with the Kobe
beef and every restaurant in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to serve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we should embrace that,
but never forget how to monetize it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all those legacy homies,
we need to help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's so important that we're
constantly looking for improvement because
[SPEAKER_01]: the market will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be ready for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be ready for what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple candy gas will not last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you purple candy gas will not
last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like candy and I like gas and I like
these, these dessert strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're going to be around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're ever going to
completely go away, but they're not always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market fluctuates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and there's so many different
things that we can chase, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is all like, what are we talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, commercially produced flour or
boutique flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many different things
and I breed for all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to go in several different
directions and we have this huge library
[SPEAKER_01]: of genetics to work with, but it's kind of
like a big paint brush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So paint brush with all these colors and
now we can take all those colors and we
[SPEAKER_01]: can blend them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using software and data to do
it, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were walking me through the facility
earlier and showing me how you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: every harvest and every crop be able to
see that Delta and chase those
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and data collection is so huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people ignore the fact
that they should be collecting a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collect over 50 points of data per
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and not only that, now we're
sending genetic out, we're sending tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture or plants out in the form of
clones out to different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're getting different data
depending on the climate, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on specific cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can start really developing
trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Big Ag has been doing this for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of big companies that are
doing this that aren't even talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, we're one of the
little guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the little guys out there,
but I feel like we're doing it at a really
[SPEAKER_01]: high level and we try to do it at a higher
level every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we constantly are trying to improve
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's guys like Fave and Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's guys like Terra International.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at our friends over there with
United Nutrients and Kaia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I R&D everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not married to any one nutrient or
any light or any one thing because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly trying to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do A-B testing against everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to you guys, you've made it
possible to take it to the next level
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've really, because of the
connections that I have through Girl
[SPEAKER_01]: World, I've been able to get more stuff to
R&D and really been able to explain why I
[SPEAKER_01]: do it and get people on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizon Lifts, they're the perfect
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally believe in their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think David over there and Rod,
they're great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just needs to get out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People need to start seeing what I'm doing
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sell genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people see that James is selling
genetics and this is how you optimize your
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dial in your levels, your PAR using a
Light Lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, especially if you're, you know,
HPS is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also dial in your temperatures and
other things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like HPS Flower, but that's kind of
going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm still going to collect the data
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, when we're talking about the
Light Lift and where you can increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD, lowering it down, or you can
basically lower your lights down and turn
[SPEAKER_01]: down the percentage of intensity,
which isn't always recommended,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've found it to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some people that they're hating
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, you're not going to get
the spectrum right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting really good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our motto, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is try before you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire Grow World platform,
which is free for commercial growers
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere around the world to join in less
than five minutes, is to try before you
[SPEAKER_00]: buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like how you started in your garage
and now you're running massive facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, craft facilities run
products side by side, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you just mentioned, you have four of
our brands in your facility today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizon Lift, Kaya, Kana, United,
Grow Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you have a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have like seven or eight Grow World
vendors in your facility today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like supporting Grow World for one
thing, but I also like the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even Beanstalk, which I probably
won't use in my facility here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having my cultivation partners try
Beanstalk and see if it works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm part of a bigger network.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't do cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't sell any flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not part of my model at all,
but I want to empower the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have cultivation partners that grow our
genetics out and I want to empower them to
[SPEAKER_01]: get better results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you know, I can't do all the pheno
hunting myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to rely on other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much bigger than one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always will like partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care how many times I get burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned over time to trust,
but verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's so huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust, but verify with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And partners is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've gone through partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had bad partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had great partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out life actually with cannabis
with growing in my garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out with the best partnership
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I, you know, and I grew pot
before I grew when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew in closets and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I started going to the garage,
I partnered with one of my best friends
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was what set me up for the future
and believing in partnerships and they
[SPEAKER_01]: could work because we had such a good
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there was honesty,
there was trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was able to move the flower for a good
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to put the work in and the time
in, and it was like, we balanced each
[SPEAKER_01]: other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good partnership right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that you don't want a partner
that's exactly like you or someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to be you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They either want to be you or you want to
be them or you want to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you want someone that's a balance
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a beautiful thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then they're like filling in the
gaps that you couldn't fill in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like my partner now with the,
with the logo, you know, and also he has
[SPEAKER_01]: the mindset to put me back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get focused like, Oh,
we should be doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this will make more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, no, we need to stick to the
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shiny object syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of friends that, well,
I call it the barracuda syndrome,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shiny object in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always chasing that next shiny
object before they finished one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're onto the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people can be successful with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have blinders on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need, you know, and like, I can have
these other things in the peripheral.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a nursery, but all this stuff goes
back to the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, I'm a genetics
company and I want to have genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: separate myself from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want better quality genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for stuff that works in a
good commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has to be that commercial
application to the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But also stuff that checks all the boxes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be different for different
environments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different environments, different
climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are specifically for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of people that I saw
auto flower that they grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a handful or the guys online that
might buy them, you know, buy the 10 pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that auto flower market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I sell 50,000 seeds to somebody
or 75,000 or a hundred thousand seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are not putting them indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going out in the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so collecting data and learning,
okay, this doesn't work really well here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to breed something that
works better in places that get cold or
[SPEAKER_01]: places that get extremely hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the extremes that really kind of
throw it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the future,
let's say like of the James Lao genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, do you see yourself walking in
similar steps of like a Syngenta or some
[SPEAKER_00]: behemoth genetics company?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I think that there will be a
day where we partner with another company,
[SPEAKER_01]: an MSO or with a bigger company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we may sell someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally okay with selling our,
you know, cause it's my brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has my name on it, but it has to be the
right person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to do right by the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is my legacy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 47 years old, so I'm a little bit
older than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've really been thinking a lot about
legacy and like, you're going to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you hit 40, you'll be like,
especially you, because you've done so
[SPEAKER_01]: much, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've already done so much as
somebody who's 30 years old that by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time you hit 40, you're way ahead of the
people that are hitting 40 with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be in the mindset of
somebody that's probably much older,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like, what do I leave behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the world that has my stamp on it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at generations too,
like my breeding book and these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that I set the bar for generations
ahead of me, you know, for 50 or a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: years, because in a hundred years,
no one's going to really remember most of
[SPEAKER_01]: our names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the, the Franklin's and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the guy, well, no, but even the
guys creating podcasts, now we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: platform, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That we have these can of crib shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the James log podcast and maybe
they won't know me necessarily,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe there'll be something in one of
these podcasts that resonates with people
[SPEAKER_01]: and that will be remembered forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and we're part of this
greater thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether it's can of cribs or
whether it's grow world or your new show,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're part of this thing that's so much
bigger than ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the new form of telling
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a hundred years from now,
500 years from, I don't know about 500
[SPEAKER_01]: years from now, cause who knows,
but definitely a hundred years from now or
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 years from now, there will be people
that will want to look back and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened in this time in the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need, you know, we want to,
we want to investigate why they were
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking the way they were thinking and
why it was so fucked up as part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cause it, in certain ways it's
pretty fucked up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be a great way for somebody to
go, okay, well this dude spent 32 years in
[SPEAKER_01]: prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's pull up all the data on this
guy, you know, uncle Rick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of my good friends and he's,
he's super important to the bigger story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he spent 32 calendar years in
prison over a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even have evidence,
real evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all circumstantial and he spent 32
years, you know, and I think 37 years
[SPEAKER_01]: total in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys like Luke's Garmazzo,
why did he go to prison?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he, he had a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said F the feds or whatever,
you know, but like, I think these things
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to, people will be curious about
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, because things are going
to change and the things always changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think things get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get worse throughout history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then with environmental
changes, who knows what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I look at things through the
lens, at least with filming and podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: of, are you telling the past, present or
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire canner crib show was the
present, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a time capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone just downloads it, started to
finish all of those episodes and just put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a time capsule, threw it in the
vault and a hundred years from now watch
[SPEAKER_00]: those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really quick snapshot of an
American growers perspective from 2015 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2025, you know, just like a 10 year run
right there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think, and, and for the new
Grow World show, we're really telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal is to just get just kind of
a, a scratching of the surface of how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing it today, but really get
into their minds of where they're heading.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can start to make actual
predictions of what these markets are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look like, because I don't know
about you, James, but everyone's making
[SPEAKER_00]: projections of when is the U S going to
legalize?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when is this going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: When is that going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually want to throw some numbers at
the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to people that are actually
doing it in these different different
[SPEAKER_00]: places and work backwards into an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's dive into some of that right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think as far as federal
legalization, how many more years do we
[SPEAKER_01]: have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a specific question
that we need to answer a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I mean, backing into that,
um, we'll, we'll kick things off with
[SPEAKER_00]: projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, everyone used to say five,
10 years, five, 10 years, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, honestly, I really do think five years
and, and hear me out with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are, uh, a couple of months away
from an election in the United States of
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, I mean, not to, you know,
get political here, but I think for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next four and a half years, it's safe to
say there's not going to be any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think whoever's coming in after
that, as the pendulum swings, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm, I'm pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a gambler, but I'm pretty
confident in that next term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we sure as hell better have more
progress than we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I see sometimes, you know,
we were just talking about burner,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cookies burner, just getting kicked
off Instagram as of yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see us making some forward progress over
here, but then other areas we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of pushed back some, um, for just
being who we are, you know, being in this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I mean, federal predictions
for the USA, I'm thinking, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum, um, globally, I mean,
we have Germany catching on fire right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can sync up on calendars and you
can make it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want to go film the top of the top
in the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have our farms, uh,
more or less selected for Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a couple of clubs, um,
in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I see Spain almost regressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some stuff going on out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I see that market regressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Germany really taking over the
European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I think it's going to be
another 10 years, believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for Columbia to actually have a
domestic market and start to take over
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with Columbia, we have to look
at what's going to happen with the
[SPEAKER_01]: countries around Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they all go legal, then that might be,
if Brazil goes, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Brazil goes wreck, it's going to change
the landscape forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone in South America in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, but especially in South
America, it's like, they're the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: country in South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they go wreck, uh, everyone's going
to want to fall suit, including Mexico,
[SPEAKER_01]: which Mexico is kind of on the fence right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he goes a little bit to the,
you know, a little to the left,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you, they make a little bit of
forward progress and then they take a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of steps back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but, but then the Caribbean is
they're embracing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Jamaica is recreational right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of, you know,
there are other recreational islands and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there are a lot of medical islands,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinidad is decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, Puerto Rico is tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's technically us too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that I would like to live
in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, I was just saying,
I was just thinking, sorry, that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: move there, um, at least half the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are you familiar with act 20 act 21
with the IRS?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think I, you know,
I like that you're close to everything
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I like the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like being down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Marlon, he's going to be in
Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he'll be down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going on down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about Costa Rica too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like going and visiting him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had friends that live down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, South America is exciting to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like going to South America,
but also I got to explore Asia a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited about Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been there before?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I have a lot of friends that are
from Asia and you know, it'd be the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's no time like the
present, but I'm so focused on this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we will be going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have genetics that are being grown in
Thailand as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you working with, uh, Arion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like your OG best friends right there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's doing amazing stuff down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and it's, it's hard cause I
look at him and he is so happy when you
[SPEAKER_01]: see someone so happy, uh, him and Yola
that are down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are so happy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really contagious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I need to go there because
you know, he's lost weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in super good shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's smiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, okay, so Thailand is going
well, just from his demeanor, just from
[SPEAKER_01]: his demeanor and you keep opening more
shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, it's great seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love seeing his success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love seeing when my friends are
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no better feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like one thing when I'm
successful, but seeing all my friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun when you win together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing winning by yourself,
but it's one thing, a whole nother thing
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're winning with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, I don't like going
out to eat by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's never been right there with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I go out with my friends,
it's always, there's always some memorable
[SPEAKER_01]: thing about going out to eat with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all about chasing experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, and there's so many different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even go to the same restaurant
twice or three times or 10 times and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: different experience every time you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Thailand, I don't know about you,
but that is one of my favorite cuisines in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing up in the Bay, we got amazing
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we have some really, really good
Thai food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnamese food, some of the best,
especially Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have to go to Vietnamese after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's lots of lots of good
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have great sushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love sushi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note to producer, don't schedule podcasts
when we're hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything's running through the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haiko has been messaging me to go film
their newest facility, the new strain
[SPEAKER_00]: hunters facility out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to do an entire Thai tour,
kind of anchored around that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go film a couple other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I'm going this year in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haiko's amazing guy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really good person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing I respect the most
about Ariane is like, they're a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've learned a lot about work culture
from Ariane and from greenhouse seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: how they operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just their inner circle of guys,
but the people that work at the coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like family to me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been friends with them for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just that work culture where you feel
like you're a part of something bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can make people feel like
that, you're going to keep them for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like they feel like it's
their home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want people that work with me to
feel like that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you get bigger and bigger and
bigger, it becomes harder and harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain that work culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're a small group of five people,
it's one thing, but when you have 50
[SPEAKER_01]: employees and for them to feel like family
and to fight like family is okay too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're that big, you know,
or whatever size, but like that goes along
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a point where a lot of
companies go in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get so big, it becomes Google or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a whole different thing
where it's like, you don't know everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes corporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it happen with Baganitas where they
went slowly went corporate, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: really like Tony McGee and Jeremy Marshall
and my friends, Jimmy, they worked there
[SPEAKER_01]: and my friend Ron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so much respect for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, also work culture over
there, like how they did it and how they
[SPEAKER_01]: kept it, like they kept it real for so
long until they got sold to Heineken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're more of a corporation,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But even still, they're not like a regular
corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I went there and it was Google
and they got guys riding skateboards down
[SPEAKER_01]: the hall, everybody loved working there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to have 420 parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are very Kana-centric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a company, you know, they had Hi-Fi
hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a beer that had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys have really pushed the
limits, but it's great when you see work
[SPEAKER_01]: culture like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at scale, whether it's greenhouse,
what they're doing or with the Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aspire to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I was originally creating
Kana Cribs, it was after Strain Hunters
[SPEAKER_00]: and Marijuana Mania and growing exposed as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just starting at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, like I watched Branko,
Rest in Peace and Ariane and Heiko and
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched their episodes over and over and
over again because I was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is my favorite show in the world,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there wasn't really anything on the US
that was missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what I aspired to be is Strain
Hunters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no one's done it quite the same
since Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, there's been other good
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got your Kana Cribs,
which is its own thing for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You set the bar for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like the new version of Cribs,
but with all these decked out grow rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: that had, you know, and I think a lot of
people have never seen, they wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity to actually go into a grow
room like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I love about Kana Cribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still don't, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we were sitting across a table
similar to this in Seattle at a KanaCon,
[SPEAKER_00]: eating one of the best salmon I ever had
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting across from Graham Farrar at
Glasshouse Farms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kelly and Ash and a couple of their
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were explaining to us,
oh, we have another investor too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to get some more
people on the show to get those people on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they weren't sure where these
people want to come visit our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a pain for them to just do
this tour over and over and over again and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that comes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was part of the initial
opportunity and filming our pilot episode
[SPEAKER_00]: at the OG Glasshouse Farms, because we
went back and filmed their newer facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the OG Farm and Carpentaria,
we filmed that episode for them to show to
[SPEAKER_00]: potential investors so they didn't have to
keep opening their doors every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mix that with a little bit,
that was our foot in the door,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you mix that with the inspiration of
Strain Hunters and Burner had,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, like three episodes of Marijuana
Mania or maybe a couple at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, I fucking love these
shows and I want to have my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of how Canna Cribs
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the production value is really high
with Canna Cribs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys put a lot of effort into making
it look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Sikorski, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been my producer and director since
day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did every single Canna Cribs,
every single Deep Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I started this new channel,
this new show, The Grow World Tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: he came along and we have an awesome crew
underneath him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But big shout out to him, as well as our
lead editor, Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been with me since college.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was editing my videos when I was doing
hackathons and entrepreneurship events on
[SPEAKER_00]: campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we brought him along as our
videographer and editor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been similar to those guys with
Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with these guys since day one,
almost 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been here since the beginning,
since episode number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and I feel like it's great
having that and growing and the growing
[SPEAKER_01]: pains and all that stuff, learning those
things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're still constantly
improving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's there's just something to be
said with working with the same person for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to know that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a marriage of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has to be good understanding and
good communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, I mean, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get to really create a body of
work, which is like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating a body of work together
where you can almost move in a rapid way
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't have to ask the other
person what they're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of my favorite parts in
working with Jason and my crew is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when we start filming in a
couple of days here for the NorCal tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than our call sheet with the time I
need to like wake up and be on set.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're doing they're running the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just show up and talk with amazing
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the easiest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the crew, they are the unsung heroes
that, you know, really bring this all to
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not be here without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all this, it just takes so much
more than one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm blessed to have the team that I
have on the growing side on the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book was a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like I get all the credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get all the credit for the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look in there, I mean,
even on the cover, it has Reggie Gadino's
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote the forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also helped edit the book, challenged
me when I was writing to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things I said to where I could be more
specific about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really was able to tease some
information out of me on you mean this or
[SPEAKER_01]: do you mean that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had my editor and we had
photographers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had so many people that, you know,
we had someone we had a couple of people
[SPEAKER_01]: doing layout.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had graphic design.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have photographers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had multiple photographers and same
thing with, you know, the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had multiple, you know, guys that
have worked with me over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my team now is just solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivation team is badass.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys I couldn't do without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be so screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because I can't do it all
myself, but they have learned,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I train these guys from the
ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these guys have learned how to do
it my way or, you know, it's it's now
[SPEAKER_01]: become our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Following SOPs and dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just smiling it in and a team
effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like commiserating with these people
with these people when it's tough and
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrating when we're winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are all parts of having a
successful business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going around the world over the next
couple of years, I want you to come with
[SPEAKER_00]: us, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to bring Ryan, bring the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Ryan loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he loves traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he loves traveling and festivals,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will make the festival wherever we
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that that's the future ahead of us,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, you know, like I said,
Spain, Portugal, Germany, Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really modeling this show after Parts
Unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like AB had friends come in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Parts Unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anthony Bourdain is one of my biggest
heroes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, I want to be the hybrid of
both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do a cooking show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted a cooking show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Anthony Bourdain, how he traveled the
world and got to experience food and
[SPEAKER_01]: shared the world from his lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to do that with what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's partially like my
version of Joe Rogan is this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love Joe Rogan, how he he questions
his guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets amazing, diverse guests like
yourself that have their contribution to a
[SPEAKER_01]: much bigger thing, which is the cannabis
industry for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just a lot of times I smile like
when I really start thinking about what I
[SPEAKER_01]: get to do for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're living a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so proud of all my friends
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to be here to be doing what
I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's so many other
things that could have happened along the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that would have prevented me from
being here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like we've overcome all these
obstacles to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're so fortunate to have been born
at the time we were born and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so trippy to think back in the past
of just one one footstep to the left or
[SPEAKER_00]: the right or one person or this or that
just one little tweak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And butterfly effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people ask, you know, like,
oh, if you would go back and change this
[SPEAKER_00]: or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love where I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a combination of a lot of bad
decisions as well as good decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't have one without the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've done some stupid shit in my
life and I've made a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've learned a lot from my
mistakes, you know, mistakes from from
[SPEAKER_01]: childhood on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made tens of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my big takeaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's made me become a
better person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's made me know myself a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it just keeps getting
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get more perspective as you get
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one takeaway that, you know,
in the last seven years since I turned 40,
[SPEAKER_01]: the big takeaway was like, oh,
I just keep learning more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I learned how much I how I actually
know way less than I thought I did about
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when my early 20s, I thought I
knew everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a know it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew enough to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was I think I'm doing in your 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my 20s, you know, I was growing weed,
selling weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also I always was told that I needed
to have another job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I had a your paper and
mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to have a I had to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't go to prison for tax
evasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to live a certain lifestyle,
you had to back that up with a paper job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't one of those dudes who was all in
on one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I worked at Charles Schwab for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for a company called Solutions
Plus and Bank of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in testing and so basically
network engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in software distribution,
security, all kinds of stuff for these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from that to getting laid off
around 9-11.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had the most amazing time working
with computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got flown all around the United States
during Y2K and got to test and record
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned a lot about data collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was a personal trainer,
learned more about data collection,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I'm getting back in shape
now, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go in another shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but yeah, data collection is so key
with everything in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wish I had had a diary from the
time I was a kid and filled that thing out
[SPEAKER_01]: religiously, because there's a lot of
important stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, I was a chef in culinary
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was growing, you know,
in the 90s, I was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing the whole time, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always had plants, different scales,
garages.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends wanted to go into a big
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we parted ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like 50 lights is a little too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the right decision in hindsight?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because he got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he got his his place got raided and all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never got raided for my grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had eight lighters in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had 10 lighters at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, 10 years ago, I was
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2018, I had several spots,
small warehouses, garages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had I had five different places I was
growing and doing seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a little bit of flower cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even that was like around 2018,
it was like hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so I was a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the president of San Francisco
Chef's Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked at Michelin Star restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked as a line cook, worked as an
apprentice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I apprentice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some really cool chefs and
learned a lot about stuff that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: do and also stuff on what not to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you watch other people and
sometimes the takeaway is I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be a fuck up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people go both directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen chefs that are amazing and
they're alcoholics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have like their their functional,
their functional, extremely functional
[SPEAKER_01]: alcoholics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can drink so much and high performing
alcoholics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd never wanted to be that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew for sure that that was one thing I
never wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I worked at country clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always been one of those guys who
if I'm not enjoying life, I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking figure out how to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like when you get to a certain
point in your life, if things are falling
[SPEAKER_01]: into place, you know, you're on the right
path.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not, maybe you need to
reevaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about the stars aligning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're on the right path,
you almost like don't have to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you're a magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the right things and the right people
to align.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's talk about genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you first started smoking,
what were you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take it back to Arlington,
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was probably what's like seventh,
eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even remember exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sour diesel or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do remember I had two older
brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found one of their stashes,
started getting curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Started smoking with my best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember vividly one of the first times
I smoked and smoked, didn't get high at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the first times I actually
did get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was we were sitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was me and my two best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were sitting on this bridge overlooking
the Stillaglamish River in Arlington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to longboard through the
streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like super late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like one of the most
magical experiences where you can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: like go back to your normal life as a
little kid after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I started consuming too young,
but it really did shape my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad's been a hippie my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he really, you know, he traveled the
world younger than myself and got to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience the hash of Morocco and down in
Colombia and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of grew up listening to those
tales a little bit and somewhat following
[SPEAKER_00]: in those footsteps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have cultivation partners there and
House of Cultivar, a big brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love House of Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my boys in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my friends in Squam, Kana
Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of friends up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle is just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the summer is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the summer, not the winter unless
you're shredding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in three months of amazing weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up on the mountain at Mount Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I broke my first bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely love the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get a little cold up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually left.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents moved me down to Tucson,
Arizona when I was about 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right around that time, actually,
Washington was going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking was kind of looked down upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have been doing it to the
outside, to the teachers and the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I left, it was kind of like,
well, there's actually a business here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during college and finishing out
high school in Tucson, it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: became accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of interesting how I was
right there at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the scene in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always been so passionate about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I bet it was like such culture
shock going into Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that was a party town,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was weed in Arizona for sure,
especially on Arizona State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in Tucson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to high school for three years,
finished out down there, and then I went
[SPEAKER_00]: to the University of Arizona in Tucson,
but ASU as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everyone had the same weed and it
was different, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Party schools, lots of party schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to probably one of the most epic
party schools in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say during my freshman or
sophomore year, I moved into this spot
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the largest outdoor pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think it was in Arizona at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could imagine every single person
was at that pool partying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like one of those massive Vegas
pools, but you're in college and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having massive house parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my school background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started some businesses, but yeah,
I did like to party a little bit.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's hard not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like living in that
environment because I didn't do the dorm
[SPEAKER_00]: route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went into houses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, starting businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of in the nightlife and stuff
before I got into tech and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just always around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually helped start a hookah lounge in
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only place like open till like
four or five a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: with my homies from Yemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a whole other kind of cultural
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met so many people in college from all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the hookah lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that that model, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend has a hookah lounge in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do the belly dancing with the hookah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Marrakesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marrakesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known the guy since I was a little
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I bought my first car from his
uncle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1994, maybe five, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subaru XT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's badass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went over 100 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subaru.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I drove that thing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I like I like smoking hookah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big tobacco guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I don't like tobacco in the form
of a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really smoke spliffs, although I
will hit a spliff or a blunt if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not my go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd really nicotine gum and smoke that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's another interesting story
about nicotine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll save that for later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, even the blunt rappers,
it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the hookah and cigars, I feel like
those are kind of special and I reserve
[SPEAKER_01]: those for special occasions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still smoke hookah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sitting around the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tribal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my first friends from Yemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like 18, 19 around that time in
Tucson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they introduced me to their world,
their culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we took off our shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drank tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we would bring out the hookah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still friends with them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, James, when I was in college,
I left the hookah lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting involved in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told my friend, I was like,
yo, Zach, you should get a license in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the state's going wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a big fucking deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, like I talked
with my father and family and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick to kind of like the
smoke shops and the hookah lounge,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's called me, texted me, hey,
when are you back in town?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually looking to buy a license,
a dispensary license in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of that full circle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a crazy place too right now with
licensing over there and the bodegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just wild, wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wild, wild west on the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really what New York is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's telling me stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he flew out there and he's like,
he's like, Nico, I'm not coming home to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tucson until I get my license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, like make sure you're, you're talking
to the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to connect them to a couple of
people I know out there, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like a massive market
opportunity, but the bodegas and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, influx right now of stores
getting kicked out and new ones popping
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some mutual friends in Arizona,
small world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very incestuous, this whole industry,
but Miles Sandowski and Earth Healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with Earth Healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them grow from, you know,
the startup side of it to really just
[SPEAKER_01]: kicking ass and taking names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's what they're doing at
scale, like the scale they're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're working in Columbia as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working in Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to see their facilities down there,
but they're just great people and we
[SPEAKER_01]: mutually know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miles and his wife, Stephanie,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tucson's a really small town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Grower's House was the only and the
biggest place to get your cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Miles would always stop by the
warehouse as well as the house for pool
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just absolutely great people,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was their first grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they really struck gold with him,
Vicky and the Pucci family, because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: kick ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he- He struck gold with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but they have such a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody plays a key role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that play key roles at that
company are just so important and they do
[SPEAKER_01]: such a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Eddie doing his extraction over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, I love working with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Miles, he's the one out of all the
people on this planet that changed my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: about Grodan and Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely did 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: 180 degree turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were off Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very anti.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I used the, I use Rockwell
cubes for plugs, but I was anti Rockwell
[SPEAKER_01]: for anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it was because I was
uneducated.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's dialed it in on a whole nother
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like when we did some
phenohunting together, popped some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed and then went through phenotypes
and he's really good at making the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: express, but the quality was bar none some
of the best Rockwell I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for commercial application,
it is the Lamborghini, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like, cause you can dial it in so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we both work with Grodan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge Grodan fan now for specific
uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we use Grodan
exclusively in the nursery for our moms
[SPEAKER_01]: and for our clones, you know, and I do
Grodan with some of the phenohunting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most of the phenohunting that we're
doing is with Coco, but I have no problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with people growing in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that as far as if you want
something consistent, it is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys at Grodan love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and I'm a huge fan of the people
that work at the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's hard to not like
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you meet the people at the company,
it's like those people don't work there
[SPEAKER_01]: for just a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work there cause they believe in the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like so many other people that
we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Miles bring it back to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, 2018, he was, I remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the OG testers of the
GrowSense model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he actually brought me to his facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably still could find a video of it
when he was just popping those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed me how it all works on his phone
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who the tester of the new
GrowSense model is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Autumn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working on the new GrowSense model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Grodan sent me out the new sensors that
just came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, there wasn't a lot of
direction with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really liked their sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the control that you have
and the accuracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really well-made and really
well thought through product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I use Agrotech and I use
Grodan and I use the sensors for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always comparing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of redundancies in the
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm constantly like, okay, well,
what did the humidity say from this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this and this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, two of them are the same and one of
them is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I getting this result?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it because the sensor is wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the placement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it this, this, this or this?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge list that we go down and we
do that all over the place because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to dial in the results that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's data-driven gardening,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what sets you apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's doing it, but everybody
should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not talking about home growers
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to grow for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking commercial at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can still grow data-driven at home
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what level do you want to take
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you have to commit?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money do you have to commit?
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things, you know, play a huge
role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how much money do you have for R
&D?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's another one that like,
it costs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, you learn a lot
about not just the products, but about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and how do you like to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's 10 different ways to skin
a cat, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's the best and most easiest way
for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the most cost-effective that still
gives you the same quality product?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm really looking for at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the best product possible for the
least amount of money, whether it's with
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, whether it's with nutrients,
whether across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it has to be the best product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of growers out there,
James, still paying the green tax,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we talk about at
Grow World quite a bit is we do have 12 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 nutrient brands that you can try at all
different price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with lights, same with media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a pretty impressive roster
of the top brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the one that works the best for your
facility at a price point that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brands that are out there today
that have, you know, kind of been around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, but have been charging those
higher rates, I think the market's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to force them to either lower your price
to what it should be or go out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them, they have such a
reputation and they've been doing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long that they have the trust and
people that will never switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charge whatever you can charge because
you're only able to charge what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if people are paying that,
that's what you're worth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people spend $1,800 on an ounce
of NorCal Nemo Skittles for one ounce,
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,800.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're worth whatever someone will pay
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the market will bear,
whatever people are willing to pay,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what you can charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may need to try to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's a happy medium to where
you can charge less and still make a good
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you charge that because your demand
is so high that if you charge less,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just going to blow through it
because you create only a small amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting seeing what
these people charge across the board and
[SPEAKER_01]: why they charge it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always trying to look like,
why do they charge so much for this light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they really thinking that they're
going to be able to sell this for that
[SPEAKER_01]: much more?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are selling it for that,
why are they selling it for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they get better results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to give me better results if
I pay $500 more per fixture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why GrowWorld exists is we are
platforming those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to provide a grow journal of
how that Kaya Cocoa Core worked versus XYZ
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our vision, is help growers learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help them become a better version of
themselves because then they can go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the manufacturers and say, hey,
this performed better at a lower cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm switching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you will never find me talking
trash about another brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not trash any of the companies that I
test their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't like it, that's between me and
maybe the company if they ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not between me and the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to downplay or pick sides
with stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give people honest
feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that about what we do where we
can help growers by empowering them with
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have a product I don't like,
I'm not going to tell people I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of GrowWorld is you have
all these GrowWorld ambassadors like
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing real-time testing on all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to collect data from all these
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is I'm not in
competition with a single other
[SPEAKER_01]: ambassador.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think the other ambassadors
feel like we're in competition either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaboration at the top, competition at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I enjoy seeing the videos that these
guys are creating and also learning more
[SPEAKER_01]: about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk pretty regularly to some of the
other ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always talking about how good
products are or what things could be done
[SPEAKER_01]: to improve the products that we already
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing this trial with Kaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the Kaya Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the CharCore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're Cocoa by Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Cocoa by Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all three on GrowWorld.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all three on GrowWorld.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very used to the CharCore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the CharCore 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one I know exactly how it performs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the bar for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Kana is the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Kaya, and I'm using Kaya right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a whole room as you saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm super excited because I see how
well the plants are performing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, well, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'll like all three for
different reasons, or maybe I'll get some
[SPEAKER_01]: more results for all three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know CharCore works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm super excited to see two other
brands that perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, Kaya is performing equal to the
CharCore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for these manufacturers out there as
well, I think it's super important that
[SPEAKER_00]: they listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they should have a forum to be able
to ask you, how are the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Powerhouse a couple of days ago
with Serge and Kevin Crouch and those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally right when I walked in,
there's like this little fabric lining
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the Kaya compressed block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, hey, what if we pull
that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if instead we have some modification?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got on the phone with Harish at
Kaya Cococore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like already on the phone with
India making the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already calculating how it would be
manufactured.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the feedback loop we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the board, lighting, substrate,
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and direct contact with the
consumers that are using the product that
[SPEAKER_01]: want to give you feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's one thing, people buy your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're uneducated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's another thing when you have a
real grower, the real cultivator getting
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's able to give you real honest
feedback on how you can make your product
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your marketing or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Beanstalk, they have killer
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their product, we had them on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked to Mother's Magnolia from
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They swear by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited to try their flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're a really well-known brand
up in that Eugene area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to see Sergio starting to require
at connect events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a brand wants to booth there,
like a substrate, like a Kaya,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to bring a grower that uses
their product and booth right next to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This most recent connect event I went to a
couple of nights ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like 30 booths there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 brands and 15 flower brands that rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Gavita Lai or those GH Nudes or
United, Kaya, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be more transparency around
that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consumer should extend all the way
down to them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go into a restaurant and grass-fed meat
is called out on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus whatever, GMO, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be great if even down
to the dispensary level, we had some
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency around, well, this was an
organically grown product versus synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: or this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a future that would
make us a better consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all for organics and I'm all for
synthetics, but I'm also for transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do love salts just as much as I love
organic in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love some organic, good organic
flower, flora and flame and organics in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also love my SF Cannaweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love my house of cultivar weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's something for everybody and
good cultivators grow good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, I think there's not
just one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's so much good cannabis out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know the right people, but as far
as, as a whole, it's only a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to our future market,
10, 20 years from now, it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: California weed just grown in Berlin,
Melbourne, Medellin.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our weed will be all around the world,
but it's going to be grown with the
[SPEAKER_00]: products they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my vision, and we can talk about this
more on your podcast, but my vision for
[SPEAKER_01]: the future is that we will have
geoclimatized varieties grown outdoor or
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that country will be known for this,
this and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to be part of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be that guy who was like,
I'm going to St. Vincent to gift them
[SPEAKER_01]: banana crosses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That I made their economy revolved around
bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had such a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gifting the country, the minister
of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gifting him in this awesome box,
20 banana crosses that I made for the
[SPEAKER_01]: island to give to the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they could grow those in an outdoor
setting and export them all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people could be like, I got that
banana stream from St. Vincent and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they don't know that it was
from me, I still did something that was
[SPEAKER_01]: like past moving it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think when we can move the
plant forward, when we can empower people
[SPEAKER_01]: to do right by the plant and you know,
it can provide them with a lifestyle and
[SPEAKER_01]: them with money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's what it's all
about at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of my friend, Cameron
Bravman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the host of Deep Roots season one,
pre-Garrett, pre-autumn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes around the world and builds
world-class facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently went to South Africa and he
shared these photos with me and they
[SPEAKER_00]: literally, from the facility that they
built, were able to afford once it was
[SPEAKER_00]: under production, a school, a football or
soccer field, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A market for the different goods to be
sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invested right back into the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings me back to Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally what they do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when he was in the Congo,
they basically did a lot of good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helped change the law too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spent a lot of money trying to change
the laws there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, a lot of this stuff,
people don't even realize the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: time and energy that goes into this stuff
that sometimes you don't get credit for,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it changes, but it's the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the effort that we all put forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think within life, there's a lot of
things you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can live to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can live to make the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's a balance of the two
that makes your life complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see there's this quote that in order for
Bill Gates to be like the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: philanthropist in the world in his latter
half of his career, he had to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: ruthless businessman in his first part of
his career, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I completely agree with
that, but I get it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to amass a great wealth,
you can't do that from just being a
[SPEAKER_00]: philanthropist, but in order to have the
impact of billions and potentially tens of
[SPEAKER_00]: billions of dollars given to causes you
care about, that part is somewhat an
[SPEAKER_00]: asterisk next to Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to give back and make that
impact, you have to find that wealth
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere and you're going to have to earn
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think there's ways to give
back that don't cost as much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's the little things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's about awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're giving back in the form of
awareness and education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love giving back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel good when I can make
people more aware of something or empower
[SPEAKER_01]: them to grow better flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because I think just talking
about the plant, we're doing good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, you know, because I think the
stigma was so it was cannabis was so bad
[SPEAKER_01]: for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've kind of pushed that agenda
and now we're normalizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's create a better product for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for
young entrepreneurs or people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: young with entrepreneurial mindset,
they're interested in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find someone that have that has walked the
path that you're looking to go down,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has accomplished something that
you're looking to accomplish in your own
[SPEAKER_00]: career and be a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Email them, call them, show up at their
work or whatever respectfully and ask them
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring you under their wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost don't believe in being self-made.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I really do believe the
coaches and the teachers and the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But past that point, you know,
once you're done with that part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: life, find a good mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find someone to kind of show you the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have several mentors, actually ones
right down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATN at Berkeley Patient Group has been
mentoring me for five plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's another friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you guys knew each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great guy and I've known BPG for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to vent there back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get an hour of his time each month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his only agreement when we first
started five years ago is that I pay it
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just find someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great mentor, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never met him in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This trip, I get to meet him for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should interview him.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I need to interview him as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to interview him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a Grow World podcast with ATN
because he doesn't do a lot of public
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does speak really well, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves the plant, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's another one that's really moved it
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely intellectual, OG, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely blessed that he said yes to
mentor me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had other mentors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the fastest advice or
sorry, the fastest way for you to go from
[SPEAKER_00]: just figuring it out to, okay,
now you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe your mentor can even connect you
to some people and teach you some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you said that because in the
last couple of shows, I've been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about how I feel that culinary arts is
very much like the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the best ways, I mean,
I'm not a huge fan of culinary school,
[SPEAKER_01]: although I do like Oakster Dam and kind of
what they bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a big fan of culinary school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the best way is to go get your
hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work in a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get a mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Become an apprentice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work as a dishwasher and learn your skills
and work your way up and have somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: take you under their wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you have somebody that
believes in you, if you're a hard worker
[SPEAKER_01]: and you do way beyond what's expected,
you will find somebody that will take you
[SPEAKER_01]: under their wing because those people
aren't easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you find them, you don't want to
let go of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to educate them and make them
even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just your overall mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of learning, I think we've talked
a lot about that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't beat yourself up, you know,
just and don't compare yourself to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be one percent better than yourself
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the Japanese, they have much
smaller increments of weights in their gym
[SPEAKER_01]: than we have over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that whole mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is gradual improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need to put on another 45
pound plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 45 basis points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if people are looking to find out more
about you or want to know about the
[SPEAKER_01]: platform, where should they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growworld.com for all of our growers and
vendors that want to join the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free for growers and for vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all sorts of options on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Growworldag or Nick underscore
Moran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to doing some events
and tours with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think the Growworld platform is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys will see me more and more on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look for our collaboration
posts, I've already done a bunch with you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to doing this again.
