[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today our special guest is Sergio
Picasso from Cultivated and the Kinect
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today, Sergio?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some great events going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kinected community and the Kinected
events are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a modern and fresh version of
what other people have tried to do in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it works really well with the
community, especially in the state we're
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets everybody together once a month,
and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to have a safe place for
networking and leveling each other up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education is something that we all want to
try to find good information from,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sources is hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, that's the cool thing,
that the people that participate in these
[SPEAKER_00]: panel discussions on whatever topic it
might be, they're giving us a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just continue to grow that educational
bank is really giving us a proper platform
[SPEAKER_00]: to really start leveling each other up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the food is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a food guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love good food, and you've always had
good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've had a bunch of different
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had shawarma the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had artisanal pizza.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had smash burgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, we definitely have a good
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's something to look forward to
every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into a little bit about your
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about the first time you started
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I was in middle school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time that I thought I smoked,
one of the homies actually brought oregano
[SPEAKER_00]: to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let's just say that was not a
fun first time experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he definitely didn't make it
back into the circle for those in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the homies' dads had a club card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was always coming to the Oakland
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always had a good stash of Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tangy, so like real citrus forward
turf profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the early on days, I was getting
some great flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really kind of what got me
into it was finding that we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being an athlete in middle school,
that kind of led into high school being
[SPEAKER_00]: the athlete plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to smoke for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a great way to get a zip and
continue to hold back that eighth and just
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so back then, what were your favorite
genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 was probably the one that really
resonates with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, the other homies plugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a bunch of really nice sticky
weed coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really know what the genetics
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just knew that it was super sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either chronic or it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had green and brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chronic was definitely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what area was this in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in the East Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was born in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in the East Bay in a town called
Danville.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was blessed to live in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an affluent area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used to live in Alamo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Alamo is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue ribbon school districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shout out to my parents, because they
both came from Mexico, first generation
[SPEAKER_00]: immigrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really didn't have much growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were living in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad was a garbage man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came to this country with nothing
and started from the bottom at a garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: company and eventually got promoted to be
a supervisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was able to get us out of San Jose
and moved into Danville in 1989.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Danville is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can't speak highly enough about
Danville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up 15 miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 miles away north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flower was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started smoking like 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the flower back then, there was
good flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there was bad flower too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, really some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being in the Bay Area, we had the
widest variety of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the white widows come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw the train wrecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of the DJ shorts, blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the old schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of stuff was created in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a lot of the European stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had real skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never called it roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big topic of debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Bay Area cat piss was the real
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall ever getting a chance to
try the cat piss back in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of debate around,
well, is it just some sort of a profile
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened when it was sitting in the
trunk and something happened along the
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's an aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to call a genetic cat piss
and say, I was the one that created cat
piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like sometimes flower,
in breeding, you come across stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: smells ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people relate the smell of ammonia to
urine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we get cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've heard about people talking
about cat piss back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a little documentary this year
on cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a lot of origin
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have some great stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And verified stories that are verified
from other people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just reconnected with some of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: That knew a lot more about the origins of
the cat piss that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I believe there's different cat
pisses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's just one ring to
rule them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of smiegels out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bay Area, high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you play in high school?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was wrestling and football.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once season ended, the other one
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was captain of both my teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really instilled a lot of
leadership qualities in me at an early
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was one of the things that
I really enjoyed was people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just really being able to inspire and
motivate has transitioned into my
[SPEAKER_00]: professional career path along all the
different industries that I've worked in,
[SPEAKER_00]: from culinary to mortgages to commercial
trucking to hospitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all the way in cannabis and
genetics and all of these different things
[SPEAKER_00]: have led up to some skill sets that I
never would have required if I hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tasted a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people watching the show know
I'm a chef or the ones that don't now they
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have some culinary history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into that real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, right out of high school,
I knew that I wanted to go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: culinary program here at DVC in Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing up in a Mexican household,
we were always cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was always helping my parents prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always helping understand what's
going on in the kitchen because I love to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, there was no Food Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Emerald Lagasse and Yanican Cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to be that next Emerald
Lagasse, just really having fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: whipping up cool flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have much growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mom was always encouraging us to get
creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have anything to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, open up the fridge and she'll whip
up this bad ass meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was always like, OK, how can we
start to mesh different flavor profiles?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right out of the gate, it's not like I
was a bad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasn't inspired by school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was part of the reason
why I wanted to jump right into culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: was because I had this aspiration to have
my own cooking show and just really get
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's fast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the program for about a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped somebody open a restaurant that
was actually a graduate from the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw firsthand how opening a
restaurant was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not what I wanted to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that wasn't the life that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of respect for restaurateurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're 19, 20 years old,
and live in that kind of a lifestyle,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really opened my eyes to what I
didn't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned all these awesome skill sets
along the way with knife skills and how
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of a brunoise cut will be able to
actually elaborate on your palate as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to a julienne or these different
type of cuts of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how important it is to cut your
vegetables on the same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uniformity is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like the power of the people in
the restaurant industry can very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: translate into agriculture or cannabis and
vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both industries of passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be driven by passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're not going to be able to
make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the culinary arts,
it's a young man's career, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: working long hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you can do that forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some friends that are chefs that
have been chefs forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lifestyle too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be passionate for what you're
doing every single day and just being
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realized that I was unhappy at
certain parts of that career path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it opened my eyes to what,
again, just tasting things that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't want to go back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did walk away from that with
food safety certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where clean behaviors and clean
practices have really applied into the
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was really, it was a
cultural set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding there's definitely
practices within a nursery environment
[SPEAKER_00]: where you don't want to cross-contaminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viroid is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogenic pressure is a reality and what
we have to deal with today in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going through a room and
defoliating, going plant to plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever was on your hands, you just
contaminated that next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already talked about vector
transmission and making sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: clean your tools properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: ISO does not clean and sterilize your
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stabilizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stabilizes the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RNA versus DNA, you got to properly
sanitize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2% VirCon, 15, 20% bleach, 30 to 60
seconds, scrub and agitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're operating at scale,
what are these practices that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing with your team?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a set of shears per table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have hand washing stations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you require a team to change gloves
before they defolate from table to table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just things that you should really be
cognizant of because it's all about the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's all about culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work culture and people, you know,
SOPs are a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get people to actually follow
those people, the pieces of paper to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, you know, implement everything
that you're talking about and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way to really do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's funny because the
kitchen is a great place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have SOPs in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do, but they don't call them SOPs
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been using these things for
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at DVC, I used to judge some of the
cooking competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the president of the San Francisco
chef's association in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, so I did a lot of that stuff
and we judge over at DVC and then they had
[SPEAKER_01]: like the gingerbread houses and I'm a big
gingerbread house guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made some huge, you know,
six foot tall gingerbread houses and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, the culinary industry
was great because again, I learned a
[SPEAKER_00]: different appreciation for flavor
profiling with food and wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that kind of like led into my
passion for genetics and how combining
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of flavors and, you know,
finding unique combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, that was a very instrumental
part of my foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that moved into mortgages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a we had a mortgage broker that
was always coming into the restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we chopped it up while I
was making his sandwich or his panini or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yo, you should probably,
you know, I'd like for you to come by my
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're personable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want extra?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want pesto sauce on this today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just kind of, you know,
it was one of those things where I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize, like, what was mortgages?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand what he was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went by.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yo, I want you to hop on the
phones from, you know, five p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to seven p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cold call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what am I saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just asking people if
they're looking to refinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the mind map of,
OK, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are you refinancing for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want I want a lower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, that's the next set of
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe the other question was,
well, I want to debt consolidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, next set of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that, you know,
solution selling was a thing until I went
[SPEAKER_00]: through and understood how you can offer
solutions without selling something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole value proposition based
selling or consultative approach was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I really appreciated
because what I learned in cold calling was
[SPEAKER_00]: some will, some won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what next?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're still saving money with a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how you evolved into a
solutions based company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a firm believer of being solutions
based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you don't need to sell a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come up with a solution,
you're not, you know, you showcase what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing and what you do best and let
your product speak for itself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's you know, that was a great
learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for mortgages, I went into
the commercial truck industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, after the crash there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously there was a lot of
change happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was I fortunately was
able to sell my house at the time and walk
[SPEAKER_00]: away without going upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I was in a very I was in a
blessed situation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my parents are foundational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had so much support from them along
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when they retired and like,
you know, mid 2000s right around there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they they pulled some cash out
of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lived in in Danville.
[SPEAKER_00]: They moved up to Plumas Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assumed their mortgage, right,
because I was generating income as a loan
[SPEAKER_00]: officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I qualified to take on that
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, you know, 22 years old with
a mortgage in Danville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was I learned a lot at that
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and that eight hundred and fifty
thousand dollar house is probably worth
[SPEAKER_01]: about two point five million easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and that was the scary part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, man, you know, the market
like I was about to go upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, somebody gave us,
you know, that break even point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we accepted it, walked away,
started from nothing at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I moved up to northern
California, or I'm sorry, to Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my brother was an executive
with a company called International Truck
[SPEAKER_00]: and Engine Corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was like, you know, there's an
opportunity up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd basically be in like an assistant to
the, you know, the regional director.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, sure, what does it even mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I didn't I didn't go to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do I didn't get my degree in
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more about finding opportunities
that came my way based on who I was and
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, putting off good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, that led me to this
particular role, which was really like an
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I learned how specing out
commercial trucks with the chassis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies and the engine and the transmission
and all these different things that go
[SPEAKER_00]: into specific requiremented, you know,
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: State of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Vaughn Safeway, like that was like our
two major accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to understand how these RFP
processes come through and we have to spec
[SPEAKER_00]: out a specific model of a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was some pretty intense engineering
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, I get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all computer based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I was a gamer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a kid growing up the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Sega Genesis was something that,
you know, I invested a lot of time into
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what was your favorite game
on Sega Genesis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Sonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, as I got a little bit
older, I went into like Mortal Kombat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that was the that was a cool
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I picked up some skill sets along the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that opportunity actually
brought me here to work at a dealership
[SPEAKER_00]: offering solutions at scale was another
skill set that I just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really started recognizing that I really
enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you branch off into the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the after the commercial trucking
industry, I had an opportunity to join a
[SPEAKER_00]: team in the hospitality space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being like a territory manager,
you know, working in the Bay Area again,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was a recommendation from one of
my brother's friends that he went to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, went to school with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, I think you should
check out this role.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'd be really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, you know, account management
walking into hotels, seeing what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they sold and basically,
you know, just consolidated all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I was in that role, I learned a
lot about, you know, organization and time
[SPEAKER_00]: management, because being able to manage
one hundred and fifty accounts in the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: Area, you got to be very strategic with
your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So utilizing technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was this that was the
youngest territory manager in the company
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a team of like a hundred different
TMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was like 24 at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so coming into, you know, the role,
all the other sales reps in that company
[SPEAKER_00]: were probably average, you know,
30 to 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that that allowed me to
kind of shine and show what I did with my
[SPEAKER_00]: organizational skill sets using
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the one thing that really
wasn't being emphasized to be efficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led to me beginning promoted very
quickly to a district manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was on a ride along in northern
California, you know, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cruising down the street on the 80 and,
you know, I see a billboard for
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're advertising,
but up on the billboard and my reps like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I probably shouldn't tell you
this, but, you know, my husband's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that conversation led to an
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That introduction led to me investing into
that organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a Prop 215 nursery up in,
you know, West Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, let's just say that the you
know, there was a plan to get into the 64
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I first got like introduced
to the industry at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wasn't I wasn't flipping packs
or anything in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more of, you know, I was I was
selling to smoke for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was never really my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to claim I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just that wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I saw the genetics aspect of what
they were doing, I'm like, cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, at the time, like the only
visibility I saw to nursery were like
[SPEAKER_00]: those YouTube videos that Kevin Jodry put
up from Wonderland, you know, and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that was pretty badass, you know,
for Kevin to like walk us through and
[SPEAKER_00]: showcase what they were doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out, Kevin, like truly inspired
me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he got the skittles cut spread out
all over from Wonderland nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, that was my first
introduction into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that that project didn't go
where it was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I saw I learned a lot from
that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very costly experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I utilized that and said, you know
what, I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do this the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's here's the vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have an indoor, clean nursery
with verified, trusted cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with the breeders and really
making sure that they're that the
[SPEAKER_00]: attribution piece was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, shot had basically just
started looking around to see if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: any opportunities out there for a,
you know, for a building with a CUP.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing like there is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you can you can just Google,
you know, building with a conditional use
[SPEAKER_00]: permit so you can actually cultivate and
say nothing like that existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was pre 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this was this was like end of middle
of 2017 right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like medical about to go wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it's going wreck, but it was still
I mean, it's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we had an opportunity from,
you know, somebody we knew, knew another
[SPEAKER_00]: person that had a building that was
offering a lease on a suite within a
[SPEAKER_00]: building with the CUP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we checked it out and,
you know, we ended up going through with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of skipped over like the whole
aspect of, you know, we didn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believed in what we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sold my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was living in Walnut Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I sold my house and, you know,
basically funded the build out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I started cultivated with
four other partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we each brought our own unique skill
sets, you know, to build out the facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: to operate the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we we learned everything
from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from, you know, from the build out
phase, like that was that was a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the did it take you twice as
long and was it twice as expensive as you
[SPEAKER_00]: originally thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say we paid the cannabis tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Performa invoice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know what the hell Performa
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, I taught myself all these things
along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so building out a, you know,
a Performa to understand what budgeting
[SPEAKER_00]: was and like, OK, well, I've got this much
capital to deploy in that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, of course, it was like 50
percent less than what I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by the time that the project was
actually done, I had invested everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I liquidated my 401K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I even sold my car because we were to
that point of like, you know, the build
[SPEAKER_00]: out was so dragged on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this was the part of like,
you know, going through the Sacramento
[SPEAKER_00]: building division like bless their heart
because they want to know they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what it is that we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was it was there was a
massive delay in like the communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've gotten a lot better,
you know, understanding what we what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: as operators and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, it was the build out process
was going way too long and we were paying
[SPEAKER_00]: rent the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just hemorrhaging funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough county to do work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, I think they've
changed a lot in the last six years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's definitely to break into that
area is tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The power company there is no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much different than other parts in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we we fortunately were able
to get, you know, get all the sign off and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember Christmas Eve on January,
I'm sorry, December of twenty nineteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had we had gotten our
inspection finalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already had plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I wanted to give a shout out
to Dan at Node Labs because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this this post from Kevin Jojeri
that he was at the Emerald Cup with Node
[SPEAKER_00]: and tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the hell's tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really where the idea of
having this trusted, healthy, clean
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery with verified cuts was was formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just hit Dan up on a DM and he
responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, shit, like this is this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just we really developed a
relationship from there and just explained
[SPEAKER_00]: to him, like, look, man, we want to we
want we don't want to get into the TC
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to be a propagation nursery,
a trusted start for people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just doing it the right way and just,
you know, emphasizing relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just a transactional
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're part of your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're an extension of your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, you know, we brought in all
of our genetics from TC, so Gen Zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were selling first gen cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was that's how Cultivated
was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the the real special part
was like we did this all ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: like me and my partners and my mom and
dad, like my mom and dad were so
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive, like they didn't want to get
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were there helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, you know, my dad was there on
Christmas Eve cutting clones, our very
[SPEAKER_00]: first batch of clones on Christmas Eve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will never forget that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've gone all in, you know,
they didn't they didn't like harass me or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like going and doing something you've
never done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just literally liquidated your entire
life savings into something that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've never done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just hella supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, like they were the ones
that were sitting on that prop table
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting, you know, propping thousands of
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the very get go, like my parents
were were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grinding with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there came to a point where
like we were really getting scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to hire employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I'm like, guys, you have to get
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like legally, you need to get paid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my parents were our first employees of
Cultivated Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the familia came into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and they've been super
foundational in everything that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't be more grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they still working with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents are retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've they put in their time
and, you know, fortunately Cultivated is
[SPEAKER_00]: on a on a good pathway right now and
really stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me about some of the genetic you
guys have that you're excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: James, I would love to say that we had a
more diverse profile of a library,
[SPEAKER_00]: but got to give the market what they want
as candies, you know, from a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, like purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we've we've had a very
diverse library, like really cool flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: from compound, from Midwest, best from
full moon genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've got some great genetics that
we've ran through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as I've been connected
with, you know, the commercial cultivators
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bulk space and a lot of the
wholesale buyers, I've got to I've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of the demand and what the
requests are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not fighting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's commercial right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulk candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was in culinary school,
I was told the best market marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy is give the baby what the baby
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the baby being all of our customers
and whatever they want, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they want purple candy gas right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be like that forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think gas is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sour is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think interesting genetics beyond the
purple candy gas are making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PIF, you know, we're going to get some
hazes coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, sure, this stuff takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's ebbs and flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're just in the purple
candy gas phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been through other phases
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, too, shall pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're leaning into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been working with the Good
Greens candy collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Joe and Phil from Good Greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we're we're we're taking
candy and just giving it a twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we're finding a lot of great,
great keepers coming out of there with
[SPEAKER_00]: very low intersex traits, by the way,
because when you start going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: population of, you know, a lot of gelatos
and just, you know, just crossed within
[SPEAKER_00]: like intersex traits are a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, we've had these things
tested with a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators in our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing some really good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some great selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually harvesting on Monday on up
up at Cush Alley or down in Cush Alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, really happy to see what we
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get coming out here and get
those new flavors out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stress testing is a big, important
thing that I don't think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing enough of, although that's
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's awareness now,
at least for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because one of the parents has it
doesn't mean it'll get passed on and
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to stress test it and find
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are the type of things,
especially for commercial viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a home grower, it's not as big
of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go buy some 10 pack of seeds in a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them have intersex traits and you
find something that you really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's some really good
cultivars as far as taste and appeal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but on a commercial scale, it's a little
bit different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when somebody has a hundred lights
of one thing or even 10 lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: One seed is not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of seeds is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stress testing is massive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial viability and really
understanding, you know, we have a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different cultivators in the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: That want to help test with us that want
to be a part of the part of the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think people saw that with
the glitter bomb project that we did,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, releasing glitter bomb in a
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Caesar on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Caesar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we, we, we saw how this project can
work where, you know, you get something
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool and special out to the group
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showcase, you know, the genetic
potential of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, kind of coming back to the
whole stress testing, there's specific
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities that have their challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure that they get their
rounds with it too, because that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give us a certain environmental
condition challenges, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistencies with, with a lot of
different factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stress testing is massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's just, that's what comes
back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what goes into the TC lab,
what's going to go through Meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's costly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to invest into that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Meristem is super important to get it
down to the callus and then replicate and
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it and then be able to replicate
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the cleaning part is
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of people that can
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Apical Biotech, Justin over
there and Matt, those guys are doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord's work in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're our business partners
and your business partner as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the people don't fully have a,
you know, grasp on what tissue culture is
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, but, but what they're
doing is something special, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a little bit different than doing
nodal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different than the stuff
you can do at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but that's the future and
also pathogen indexing is so important,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we get into pathogen indexing and
being able to verify that your stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: clean and being able to show your
customers that it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'm glad you touched on the
difference of what nodal versus Meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not a lot of people can do
Meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that they're getting their
genetics clean, fully clean and restored
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're just getting nodally
propagated, which there's a, there's a use
[SPEAKER_00]: for nodal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's benefit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not getting down to the,
to the cleanest form of that Meristem,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that, I mean, that's the,
that's the kicker right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to find the winners that we
want to be able to commercialize and
[SPEAKER_00]: really put out to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, the commercial validation
process takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just an F1 release.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this stuff takes years to actually do
variety testing and phenotypic studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a year minimum to properly do it
and to get your selections and to prove
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think a lot of people,
they find something good and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: release it and, you know, and that's okay
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the, the real process takes a
lot longer and it's a marathon and not a
[SPEAKER_01]: sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that the professional maturity of
the industry does gravitate towards more
[SPEAKER_00]: gas and say, you know, all these great
flavors that we want to bring back and
[SPEAKER_00]: unique complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause right now it's just candy,
you know, and understanding that it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, we're not fighting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just, we're, we're making sure that
the cultivators that we work with are
[SPEAKER_00]: positioned for the best possible outcome
with the highest ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really emphasizing quality,
you know, and I think that's what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of talking off the mic was we have
tools like shout out to Aroya that has
[SPEAKER_00]: this tool that we can measure and,
you know, substrate water content and EC
[SPEAKER_00]: and making sure that we're in a parameter
of an irrigation strategy for a small bud
[SPEAKER_00]: treat like a candy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we can hit these,
hit these optimal yields with quality
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to deploy genetics,
that have irrigation strategies is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I, I handle all the sales are
cultivated because I want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: people are getting what they, you know,
what they should be geared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, if you're calling me up and
saying, Hey, what do you got on the menu?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, are you just selling in the bulk
market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you are, you're all, I'm going
to, I'm only going to offer you white runs
[SPEAKER_00]: or lemon cherry gelato or soon to come G
33.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, just being able to just have
that on the menu and be able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how you can irrigate it to,
you know, get your 80 grams of square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: with quality behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got buyers asking, where's this stuff
at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got the fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now it's a battle of quality and
there's price points for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, I think more breeders need to
start sneaking in stuff and crossing them
[SPEAKER_01]: with the candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not tricking people,
but at the same time, reintroducing those
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors in something that's approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are starting to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're getting a lot of interesting
expressions coming out and that gets candy
[SPEAKER_01]: along with some other funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not just GMO, not that there's
anything wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Donnie burger, GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have their place for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you're right about the uniqueness
of, of flavor profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we also touched on that
earlier was like, yo, there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different flavors, subjective flavor
profiles, but we can really hone in on
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things when we're hunting through
the progeny, finding that unique twist on
[SPEAKER_00]: the candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, that's again,
that's where the good greens candy
[SPEAKER_00]: collection has that new age twist of
candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're excited to be hunting
through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that seed release is coming in
the near future, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm excited for the future of
the genetic breeding projects that are all
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got a lot of great work
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to get a Fino or two from
the, you know, from your bank that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: put in and let the market enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got a lot of great Z-crosses
that are productive, that are mold
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant, that have vigor, that fit the
nine week window, you know, like there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of stuff that I would love
to bring in for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on some stuff that's way
less than nine weeks because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think right now you just got
to fit that specific profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be candy colors in demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't have color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like that being a qualifier
is just, you know, we, we want all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things and it's, it's almost
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially if you like flavor,
I don't know, it's just one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's again, this kind of goes back to the
commercial validation aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't fit within at, at most that
nine week window, I mean, you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that those five and a half turns a
year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it doesn't fit within that
window, then you know, and if irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy is just such a hard thing to
accomplish within your facility and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't manage without measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not on any substrate
monitoring or sensors, sensor tech
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got an interesting question the other
day about when do you start counting days
[SPEAKER_01]: of flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always counted from the day you
flip the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the first day of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go photo, but some people,
they start counting from the first day you
[SPEAKER_01]: see actual flowers on the butts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was really interesting
because there's this big confusion and
[SPEAKER_01]: either way could be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If as long as you're doing it consistently
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, exact consistency is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you're tracking or managing
whatever timeframe it is, I'm just looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at from when you go 12, from when you go
12, 12 to full maturation at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you're going, you know,
seven to 10 days on, on your, on your
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy, on your stretch period and
you're going generatively and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping back to, you know, to bulking out
like week three, or maybe even if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with candies, you're, you're
shorting up that window and flipping to
[SPEAKER_00]: bulking at day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to finish a day 53.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like Skittles that's like 50
day 53 to day 56.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to day 63, it's, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's got some interesting
flavor, but it's not as candy as if you
[SPEAKER_01]: pull it somewhere between day 53 and day
56.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let it go a little bit longer,
you're going to have more of an overripe
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, dirt profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's, that's good criteria
to let the cultivator know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yo, if you're growing this,
these are the things that you need to look
[SPEAKER_00]: out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be washing this,
maybe you need to pull it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those, some of those genetic
profiling tips is what we're emphasizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's where just having a
manageable ERP and data database to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: these recipes and to be able to deploy
them at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, that's why it's great
having these systems in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really all about data points with
everything in life, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking, you know, the, the culinary world
totally translates to cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of developing a palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have my book coming out and there's
a huge, there's a whole chapter on
[SPEAKER_01]: developing a palette, but it's just
collecting a bunch of data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more data points you start to
understand it better, the more times
[SPEAKER_01]: you've experienced it, you understand what
you like, what you don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it's like Rose, I love the
Rose turps, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Rose is amazing, but there's,
it's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Rose petals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Rose water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, you know, there there's so many
different roses, like literally there's
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh Rose off the stem that there's more
floral side to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, and there's, there's five
different or six different roses that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can think of right off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starting with your core base of fruit,
floral, fuel and earth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where do you branch off from there
and finding unique within those criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: points?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, that's, that's really, I'm,
I want to come back to your book,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know we've been talking about
Barcelona coming up and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the connect community is growing at
such a pace that we have support to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, we've been talking about,
you know, doing a collaboration and doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, your book signing at the connect event
on March 15th at, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect place, perfect time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the real cannabis enthusiasts,
people who love flower, love the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very passionate people at
spandibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I love about spandibus the
most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to bring my book there and
to share it with people from all around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to work together,
you know, on a connect event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be a fun thing for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spandibus is just, you know,
it's my favorite event of the year.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be my first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, man, just, just, just really
exploring and getting more, getting more
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, you know, spandibus that the
whole time, the trip just checks all the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got good food, you got good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got cannabis, you got people with
ideas and concepts from all around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're hearing about new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, trends work differently in
different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like a lot of people
follow suit from what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bay area, but that's not the case always
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like people are starting to do
stuff all over the world that can impact
[SPEAKER_01]: what we do here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just touched on something that
made me like really excited about the
[SPEAKER_00]: topics that I've seen a lot of people come
out to, you know, this past Tuesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, up in Sacramento, you know,
at Anderson Hydro, we had over 250 people,
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 people show up for the Arroyo office
hours live discussion on crop steering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that was, you know,
it was a Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the biggest turnout we've
ever had in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've been doing these
events for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just super grateful for the people
that have put their hands in to help make
[SPEAKER_00]: this production occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a small team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're really starting to build this
thing out and, you know, to find topics
[SPEAKER_00]: like this that we can take across,
you know, take across the globe,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's Barcelona or Thailand or
Columbia or wherever it is that we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do more events.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal is to help unify everybody
with education and be able to provide this
[SPEAKER_00]: network and, you know, just cross
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest thing is I want to get
more perspective and bring awareness so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can just grow better, grow better
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The king of cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an interesting time to be
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting time to be in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think times are tough for some
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Times are not tough for other people,
but it's really an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in an in-between time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I guess we're always in an
in-between time because we're ever
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with technology now, we're growing
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: AI and probability and these AI models for
the future of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential that AI has to be able to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade libraries and markers, you know,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not to go too far off
track, but like we understand that Gene
[SPEAKER_00]: editing is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are certain levels of
understanding and professional maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, with that space specifically,
because we already know what happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to understand that there's
definitely layers to what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this stuff responsibly and
being able to find pathways to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, make it as healthy as possible so
that you don't have to worry about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, PM or all these other things
that might occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marker driven breeding is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many of us have had issues
with powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a person anywhere in the world
that's grown, that's humid, that is
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, you're going to have PM issues
at least one point with one cultivar in
[SPEAKER_01]: your life, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics that are, you know, bred in
Thailand are going to probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find a much more resistant
cultivar to PM that it's hunted in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hundred percent humidity factor,
like, yeah, that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Carpinteria just right here in
Southern California coastline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a hundred percent humidity for
like four or five months out of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place to identify varieties
that don't have issues with powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: or botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes back to commercial testing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Validation and verification of these
genetics before this get released.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to understand if something is
susceptible, I'm not going to recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that to a, you know, a company out in
Thailand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just one of those things
that comes back to being responsible in
[SPEAKER_00]: the curation phase, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual, the phenotyping, just making
sure that you're capturing all these data
[SPEAKER_00]: points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes back to data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot manage without measurement and
being able to track and manage all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, which is a big reason why Cultivate
IQ is in development right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this solution that's being built
by cultivators for cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start tapping in all these different
variables from phenohunting to POS,
[SPEAKER_00]: retail, supply chain, all these different
solutions.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, shout out to Mo Korshid,
like he's developed a lot of data within a
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we're actually using for
projects that we're consulting with on
[SPEAKER_00]: other operations that are using this
information to keep track of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that we're managing it with
measurements, to make adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what's cool about that,
James, is like, I've seen so many
[SPEAKER_00]: operators have a disconnect in
communication from the cultivation team to
[SPEAKER_00]: the owners or the financial people holding
the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's very difficult for a lot of
these operators to have that discussion of
[SPEAKER_00]: why, why we're not hitting better yields,
why we're not having a higher ticket on
[SPEAKER_00]: our packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sometimes it's not as easy to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That environmental challenges lead to,
you know, transpiration challenges,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why we're getting lower yields or
our quality is not as good because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: having these massive EPD swings and we
have PM or all these things happen when
[SPEAKER_00]: the person writing the check for the bills
and doesn't want to make the investment on
[SPEAKER_00]: these improvements to the facility or
maybe different tools, or maybe you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: using sensors to monitor your drybacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these factors, that's where
you're able to bridge the gap
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So truly emphasizing on this tool,
that's really going to centralize the
[SPEAKER_00]: communication gap and the barrier is what
we're excited about because it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already using this at, at multiple
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as, as we continue to work
and develop on this thing, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more user friendly and, you know,
ultimately just bring that solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, the, the future is looking bright
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think some people see the grim
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be an optimist all around,
but yeah, technology is going to have its
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and if we collect enough data,
it's just, that's just a given,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's the thing is just,
you have to have the right team in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having people that are committed to data
collecting and, you know, making it,
[SPEAKER_00]: making it easy to collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's plenty of, there's plenty of
great software solutions out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, really, really
understanding why you're doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: in and why you're having that,
that soft cost dedicated towards data
[SPEAKER_00]: capturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a reason behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and it grows exponentially,
the value grows exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first year of collecting data,
you might not get that much value,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you look over a period of five
years and you can go back where you've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown something out multiple times in
multiple places, you can really start
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying the value of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production value at scale.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just understanding what you maybe
should or shouldn't be growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also developing breeding lines,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So developing breeding lines that it takes
data to really do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I built my own ERP for
Cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've explored a number of different out of
the box services and nothing really got
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the intricacies of what I was
trying to track and manage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every single clone comes off of
every single plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every data point that you can
imagine, I've tracked and managed it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I built it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I understood that there was a
certain level of criteria that it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: an out of the box solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really had to find a way to make sure
that I can build that while we're building
[SPEAKER_00]: up this, you know, this massive database
of genetic, you know, genetic library
[SPEAKER_00]: information so that we know that if this
is coming back into rotation, we can know
[SPEAKER_00]: how many clones it's going to produce and
all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the pathogenic pressure?
[SPEAKER_00]: When's the viral load actually start to
express?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it actually cost to produce a
clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, just making sure all the
plants stock like we test for moms once a
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's there's there's multiple
types of testing leaf with fruit leaf only
[SPEAKER_00]: root only combination of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's maintenance testing and
there's like intake testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that you do have a full
data point on like that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you guys doing the in-house testing
or do you send out for third party?
[SPEAKER_00]: We send out for third party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've worked with a number of labs,
a lot of amazing labs that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think deserve some credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, Jeremy Warren over at the
Dark Heart Nursery Lab out in Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done some fantastic work.
[SPEAKER_00]: AL&L Crop Solutions out in Vacaville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annalisa's, you know, fantastic,
wonderful resource in my Florida DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've really found their
pathway to to bring rapid analytics at a
[SPEAKER_00]: cost effective solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I love working with multiple
labs, but ultimately just holding
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know when there's a potential
pathogenic pressure hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back to data, we know how
to track and batch track to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do have the proper protocols in place
to eradicate and make sure that we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and track what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nursery models changed so much over
the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the availability of testing now is
like, you know, anybody can get their
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff tested technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can just get a violet,
take your whole your leaf punches and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get you get your results back in a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not sooner, if you're like,
you know, really on the horn and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, guys, this is an emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, can you please see if there's an
opportunity to maybe expedite this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can mail that back and forth
and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you see the industry in five
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, right now, I think we're in a
very interesting point of compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of alignment that
is going to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the future, obviously,
with legalization happening on the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront, you know, there's just there's
so much potential to have organized groups
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in the craft market or that are
at the full scale market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, you know, you're going to I would
love to see the craft brewery model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would aspire to see something
very cool like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's just so much
opportunity here that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, it comes back to
professionalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are going to make it
through that are not professionally mature
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes back to good people and
good practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being driven by the by the PNL is very
difficult to do when you're you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have moral ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a big part of this is around
like, who do you work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you surround yourself with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want to continue on this
pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why are you really here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you truly have passion for this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a big part of where
we're heading in this future is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start to see some people drop off
that are in this for the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I've I may not have grown
up on the Hill and, you know, dedicated my
[SPEAKER_00]: life to it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've I've gone all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my chips are in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm here to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really what I enjoy
about the industry of where we're heading
[SPEAKER_00]: is, again, like growing the connect
community is has given me so much
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfillment and being able to educate
people, bringing on experts to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what their experience has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's the future I want to see
is more collaboration, competition over
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration, over competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, growing together is really
the emphasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you got to look the ones that
are left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've already seen a lot of
people fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are left are really
passionate people for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is it's we're collaborating with
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to collaborate with each other and
we need to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to build a small business,
that is the best way is through
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in competition with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people see this competition side
of it, but that's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work together so we can improve
the quality of what we're doing and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: build the people up around us that are
doing similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: James, you know what the one thing that I
learned about this whole thing or about
[SPEAKER_00]: myself throughout this entire journey is
what I'm not good at and what I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend time on because it makes me
unhappy or whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I surround myself with people that
compliment myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really important when
you start to look at the future and where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting your business or maybe
aligning and merging with another business
[SPEAKER_00]: partner, picking your partners is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you really understand
what it's going to mean when you until you
[SPEAKER_00]: really start getting into a partnership
and understanding that everybody has their
[SPEAKER_00]: own skill sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where your skill sets may be limited
is perspective of your partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether it's going through and
really aligning myself with people that
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement these other, you know,
aspects of what I'm not good at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm not a good software
developer, even though I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: taught myself how to use AI and do all my
marketing and, you know, all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't mean that I can code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to put, you know,
this, this, this ERP together and like
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out Mo, you know, Mo really did
create a very special platform that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really working and emphasizing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the best part.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, that is the best part of
the legal market is that we can become
[SPEAKER_01]: specialists in whatever we're really good
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you kind of had to do
everything, you had to be in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you're a grower, you had to
do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be the electrician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we did extract, we did
cultivation, and now you can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move forward as a specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really good, you will never have
a problem getting work for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you will always have a job if
you're really good at what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can become a specialist,
the best of whether it's an extract artist
[SPEAKER_01]: or an electrician, or you're going to be a
cultivator, or you're going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are the best at that, if you were
in the very top percentile, you are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty of where we're at
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, some people, you know,
you get mixed opinions on everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel like in my opinion,
that is one of the best things from
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational is we can really become
specialists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can really work on improving the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't agree more, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to have a cultivation
facility to be in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at these curators, these tastemakers,
these people that have such refined
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets, you know, like that there's,
there's a lot of room for opportunity in
[SPEAKER_00]: this space and really focusing on what
makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're good at sales, you can do sales,
you know, the brokers can evolve into
[SPEAKER_01]: being brokers in the regulated market too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think there's potential for
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're passionate and you love
what you're doing and you become a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist, you become really good at
that, you are going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it doesn't, it doesn't mean that
you had to have God given talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just get up every day and work
hard and be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the thing is like, sometimes
it's about falling down seven and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: up that eighth time to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having gratitude for the gift of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was something that was
instilled in me at a very young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my mom and dad were
entrepreneurs and my dad, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming, you know, into this world,
into the United States with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with nothing, no education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it was incredible to see
like how work ethic was instilled in us at
[SPEAKER_00]: a very early age and just, just being
grateful for what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not a lot of people have opportunity
to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, and if you're willing to grind,
you're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's like, you got to,
you got to look past all the bullshit and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think being spread out and have
having too many focuses can be a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: too, like it's going to disallow you to
follow through on your, on your
[SPEAKER_00]: commitments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's James, that's what I'm
seeing a lot of, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate to see how many people
are casting their, their net as wide as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and not following through on
their commitments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just keep it narrow,
understand what makes you happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting up and what drives you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have so many projects going on that
you're just, you don't know what to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should probably step back and audit
what the hell you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to find what makes you
happy and what makes you tick and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you're on that right path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the Japanese principle of a
Kige, which is like what you're good at
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you're passionate about and how
that crosses over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about finding that perfect
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And life is about balance, you know,
and life is about hard work and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they said life was easy, they lied to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, I think there's times
where life can be easy and some people
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to strive for life, but I get
more gratification from the struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and it's, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start as we get older, we start
learning about different philosophies and
[SPEAKER_01]: different principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we start developing our own ideas of
what happiness is and what success is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when I was younger, when I was 18,
I thought success was a lot different than
[SPEAKER_01]: how I see it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Success is being happy with the people you
love and care about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly think like, you know, momento
more, death is inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just having this like weird
psychological understanding that death is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming, but appreciate what you have and
just be grateful for where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seize the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, dude, how, how many hours
a day are we on this thing just glued to
[SPEAKER_00]: our attention, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best and worst present that we
ever have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just spending this time together and I
haven't looked at my phone this entire
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I really engage and I really
like that, that connection that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people that come around your life
either get good vibes or you get this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we didn't really connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's, that's what good
business partnership, like to me really
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a good connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to validate certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're able to tell me if
something's completely off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be candid about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a term called kind
candor that I truly believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you, you fucked up
because I care about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want you to make that same
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tell me the same thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you expect out of your real
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, honesty, you know, it comes down
to integrity and honesty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are like the most important
things in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no blueprint to what we're
doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, that's, that's the
biggest part around like collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, just being able to truly
lead into our strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yo, dude, I've,
I've gone down this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should probably take a look at
this perspective because here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain people that just don't
want to see that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, like that's why you got
to start auditing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a circle of really who you're
spending time with and how, how much time
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dedicating to that ton of time
vampires out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time bandits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them time bandits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's funny, but they,
they, they say that you are a reflection
[SPEAKER_01]: of your five closest friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you really want to look at yourself,
look at your five closest friends,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's pretty much who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an average of the five closest
friends that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're five business people that you
associate with the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally think that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're impacted by perspective and that's
a, you know, that there's only so much
[SPEAKER_00]: time in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I have a lot of good people in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of good influence,
a lot of good friends, people that really
[SPEAKER_01]: give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, that's what
counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, that's what keeps me
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even through the tough days, cause there's
tough days, there's always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tough days and there's always going to be
good days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just going to keep going
through, you know, till we're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's a really good point,
James.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I really enjoy seeing like all
these brands that you have up on your wall
[SPEAKER_00]: here, man, like you've got a great
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've clearly done a lot with a lot of
good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's something like,
as we start to build and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: row together, like that's what we can do
to continue evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's innovation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what you showed me earlier on,
on, on your, uh, you know, on your Fino
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting project that you've got going on
with the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I instantly started
thinking like, how do we work together on
[SPEAKER_00]: that side to incorporate it with what
we've got going on over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's good business to be had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now is the time to look at,
you know, good actors and bad actors and
[SPEAKER_00]: auditing that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they stand out and somehow the bad
actors, every once in a while get back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, you know, they last for a
little while, but you know, times are
[SPEAKER_01]: tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the beauty of this podcast is that
we're recording oral history of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've had some guys,
Richard DeLisi, who did 32 years in
[SPEAKER_01]: prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we, uh, just did a interview with
Luke Scarmaso who did 14 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to get us to the kind of point
we're at, but like this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that 50 years from now or 75 or
a hundred years from now, maybe even 200
[SPEAKER_01]: years from now, people are going to want
to know how the heck did it get to this
[SPEAKER_01]: point?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so crazy back then, you know,
and we're able to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of share our stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's amazing having people like
yourself on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can kind of share their stories and,
you know, who knows, maybe we'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: another podcast in a year or two years and
the industry will be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can agree more, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, you know, this is the origin story
of where we're at in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're, we've all, clearly
there's a bunch of people that have paved
[SPEAKER_00]: the way and given their lives for people
like myself to come into this as an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and like really understand,
like, this is what I want to do and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: value in a certain way that, you know,
that I felt that I could, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of gratitude for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and shout out to everybody that is
still fighting the good fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I really hope that we can
get everybody out of, out of, out of
[SPEAKER_00]: prison for marijuana related crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is just, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense that we're able to
be here and contribute and pay taxes on
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people in prison for doing
what we're doing now, legally,
[SPEAKER_00]: non violent cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, come on, like get these people out,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are getting them out, but it's taken
a lot longer than it should,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm grateful that we're here,
you know, and I think there's just a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of opportunity collaborating with good
people moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if, you know, if I can just
say anything to, to the community and
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want to get into the industry,
it's just be humble, get in, experience
[SPEAKER_00]: things for yourself, because understanding
what you don't want to do is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're never going to experience
until you try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because especially in cultivation,
cultivation is hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of, a lot of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it goes in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things, it's trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might think you really want to do it
until you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, hell no,
I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, this is where, you know,
leaders building good teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you got to stay present with
the people that you work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and having these quarterly
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the term review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't do reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I want to make sure that we can block
out time every quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So James, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand what challenges
you're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand what makes you
unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately when you start working
in an environment that makes you happy and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dedicated to commit every day,
like there's farms that we've worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can see the transition of like,
I want pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have pride in the flower that
we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to take that flower and I
want to be representing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the flower that we grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to show it to all my friends and
show them that I was part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, you know, it's an experience
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're sharing an experience with the
people around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty of what we're,
I mean, that's part of the reason you and
[SPEAKER_01]: I are both here is cause we're able to
share this experience with people around
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a big part of that comes
back to, you know, leaders and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a good leader or you have
opportunity to grow as a leader and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to put somebody in a role and
understanding what their succession plan
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, once you got it all figured out,
you got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you've got it all figured
out, you got to be able to reevaluate
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and be able to look at it from
an outside perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times be true to thy own self,
you know, and I think that's a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: like continuing to grow and you know,
just what are the iterations of yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do you want to continue
progressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, again, why building a
strong team starts with communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to understand what makes you
unhappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're in the wrong role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this just is not the right career
path for you, which is totally fine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you need to go into retail and
maybe you go and need to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem firing people by the
way, because I feel, and I learned this in
[SPEAKER_01]: being a chef was that, you know,
at first it was tough for me to fire
[SPEAKER_01]: people, but I think it's important to fire
people and let people go if they don't fit
[SPEAKER_01]: because they belong somewhere else and
you're holding them back by not letting
[SPEAKER_01]: them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're holding them back from whatever
their destiny is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't agree more and taking your
accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me as your leader that brought
you into this, I think I may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: given you enough time to really develop
your skillset that I initially saw during
[SPEAKER_00]: the application process, during that
onboarding time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just understanding what
people's strengths are and you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you make time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these quarterly collaborations,
what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far out do you want to get into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the nursery, you know,
you're limited to what you can get into,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so many departments that we
have in propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you start to develop, well,
now that I've seen the nursery side of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I want to get into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a network of bunch of cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hey, I got this person that really
wants to get into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the first person to make that
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody's unhappy, I'm the first
person to write that letter of
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation to get into somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know what I hired them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's the part of
leadership that people are just
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, listen, just talk to your team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're here with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why, you know, my name,
The Custodian, kind of came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not afraid to clean shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work underneath everybody to make sure
people are successful and happy doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for
yourself that was just starting out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, you can go back and talk to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I don't, I don't have any
regrets about anything that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything happens for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think advice to myself, I'm just should
be more, be more open-minded, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because truly I, I've done a lot
that I'm proud of and I've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: iteration and self growth because this is
not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no blueprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've, you know, I've taught myself a
lot throughout this industry and really
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how certain things that I
needed to do to build a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've, I've got a great
network of people that have helped me
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's the biggest thing
is just my, this is kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like my dad, you know, coming from
Mexico, he was, he's always like,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't trust anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I'm leaving, he's like,
don't trust anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my pops would be talking about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he, and obviously he had his own
experiences, but I always took that with a
[SPEAKER_00]: grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, yo, be cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you have my trust until you show
me I can't trust you to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was, that was the one
thing that like, you know, working in
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and being able to work with a ton
of cultivators that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: calling us to, to buy cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I got to work with a ton of
great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also got the exposure of a lot of
people that took advantage of my kindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, not to the degree of
like closing the business down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just, just, just knowing that there
was people that are trying to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage because their backs up against
the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you mentioned this earlier,
like people do some shitty stuff when
[SPEAKER_00]: their back is up against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just something we have
to be cautious with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if somebody is trying to get ahold
of you, where can they find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty active on Instagram,
you know, so Sergio underscore the
[SPEAKER_00]: custodian is my direct handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also manage the cultivated genetics
handle and the connect community handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those are at those specific words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, I'm pretty accessible
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm here to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you really want to like
comment, I encourage you to come out to
[SPEAKER_00]: these connect community events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to our website or you go to our
Instagram page, there's a link in the bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got everything you need to know
about our events, the RSVPs, the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel to watch all the different panels
that we've put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I encourage like right now
people think it's just for cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no, but tenders need to get to these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, everybody, if you love cannabis
and you want to learn more about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great place to meet other people in
the industry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's the whole aspect of that
alone is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, James.
