[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James loud podcast
[SPEAKER_06]: and today our special guest is David Downs
executive editor from Leafley.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing today David?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello James Thanks so much for having me
and thank you James loud watchers for
[SPEAKER_00]: tuning in and so appreciate your guys's
time Man, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad you're on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been like You know cannabis celebrity
cannabis Aficionado one after the next the
[SPEAKER_06]: top growers the top writers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah someone you know, I wrote a book
recently and Before I wrote the book and
[SPEAKER_06]: when I was writing articles I looked up to
your work and I feel like you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it for a while your San Francisco
Chronicle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you doing some amazing stuff and You
know, I feel like there was the high times
[SPEAKER_06]: guys and then there was the guys that went
more mainstream that had more To risk and
[SPEAKER_06]: you were one of those guys for sure,
you know, it's great having you here on
[SPEAKER_06]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Yeah, I've been on the beat since
2009 started at the East Bay Express in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland just up the road from here at an
alt weekly and we you know conceived of
[SPEAKER_00]: executing a cannabis column the way they
covered courts or sports or City Hall in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of a lot of factual analysis and
three live sources and staying on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: trends And at the time I was a freelance
journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had written for Wired and Rolling Stone
and the onion I had like a music and
[SPEAKER_00]: technology background and I was really
concerned like is this going to sabotage
[SPEAKER_00]: my career and It went from being like one
file folder in a file cabinet to being
[SPEAKER_00]: like my entire life I've written three
books and it's taking me all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and We're still on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still day one pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's so great because I feel like
we're in this amazingly beautiful time
[SPEAKER_06]: with with cannabis and Decriminalization
it hasn't happened yet, but we are in this
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful Place because we are the ones as
a collective group making all this happen
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure and with the podcast with the
writing with the cultivating You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're on the shoulders of some Giants that
came before us that were real Cowboys and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and considered outlaws and those
people that are were outlaws I feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: they're businessmen now doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're businessmen We have you know
entrepreneurs businessmen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't call them those things Back
then they were outlaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think of Larry June He tells you
to bet on yourself and start a corporation
[SPEAKER_00]: and put your people on payroll and pay
your taxes and be enterprising I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at this era where they're passing
the torch down the boomers are finally
[SPEAKER_00]: letting go of the steering wheel or is
being pried out of their hands and the
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation of culture keepers are
coming up underneath them and They're
[SPEAKER_00]: really enterprising They're using all the
tools available to them and it's great to
[SPEAKER_00]: see so many of them Kind of just run wide
open in a time when they're really needed
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much a golden era of cannabis
with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then every day new markets are
coming online I get to tell good news
[SPEAKER_00]: stories to people every day and spread
this literal gospel Ohio just launched
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida's got adult use on the ballot
South Dakota, I think might have to vote
[SPEAKER_00]: on it again and We see all that new
interest and new people coming in every
[SPEAKER_00]: day at Leafly and it's very energizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Well, and I think a lot of people,
you know cultivators and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_06]: some people are down in their luck and
there are tough times at the same time,
[SPEAKER_06]: but there still is the beautiful side of
the story and I love both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can't have one without the
other is the yin and yang the balance and
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you move into a market like this
There's gonna be a time where it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: stable which is going on especially in the
California market right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not very stable and there's upcoming
markets like Florida which really excites
[SPEAKER_06]: me New York, which is kind of a shit show,
but still really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's The best of times and worst of
times it just depends on what you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: your talk to we did SF weed week in April
and SF hash week in July and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: these big series of events to honor the
cannabis culture in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and We consistently talked to people
who are adding lights really excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: the future adding buildings Getting like
selling out like they can't put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: their wholesale websites fast enough and
it's being scooped up at the same time you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear people who are having a really tough
go of it they've gave it their all they
[SPEAKER_00]: put all their final dollars on it they
still had some tough breaks or just the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes are bad the regulations are bad and
they're really suffering and it's tempting
[SPEAKER_00]: to think that that experience is
globalized but you have to remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who are doing well are kind of
quietly doing well because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gauche to say to someone who's suffering
like that's too bad for you we're we're
[SPEAKER_00]: rocking it out over here yeah and so I do
see all of it and we're ultimately gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: just be in this era of price compression
and industrialization of production so you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to like deal with that reality
but the good news is that if you have good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff we see it still commanding top-shelf
prices you just talked about $500 ounces
[SPEAKER_00]: right you know around here that are still
being commanded even as you know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing about the $9 eighth down in SoCal
yeah and I mean there's a handful of guys
[SPEAKER_06]: really setting the bar for what good
cannabis is for what good quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: is you know I mean blueprint we got Jordan
from blueprint growing amazing stuff over
[SPEAKER_06]: there you know obviously connected they've
been killing it for years but SF Canna,
[SPEAKER_06]: Planta, you know NorCal Nemo we got the
Hushle brand my buddy has that and these
[SPEAKER_06]: guys are really you know and then you got
breeders you got you know even Doja and
[SPEAKER_06]: all these guys like really trying to push
the boundaries with genetics trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: change it up a little bit not just
offering lemon cherry gelato because
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not gonna get buy-on-runs or lemon
cherry gelato anymore yeah I mean I too
[SPEAKER_00]: see amazing top-shelf growers and the cool
thing is the top shelf just keeps getting
[SPEAKER_00]: higher yeah whether it's because you got
the cost per unit down and it's still that
[SPEAKER_00]: triple a quality or you found like a
quadruple a quality that nobody has seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before I must smoke hundreds of strains a
year between judging cups and reviewing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything for Leafly and I have never
gotten like bored or tired or thought I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it all every day brings a new thing
across my radar just this week it was
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with their trop z that just
dropped across of Zeno to granddaddy
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and Tom Hill Hayes a mix of new and
old where they were trying to go after a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa hybrid effect and revivify the
sativa space yeah I like that space yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: not everybody does and I feel like a lot
of people steer away from it like when I
[SPEAKER_06]: show them super silver Hayes they're like
whoa that doesn't fit well into the market
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's like maybe not your market but if
you go up to Mendo or you go up to humble
[SPEAKER_06]: or you go Sonoma and you talk to any of
the OGs you show them that they're like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I love this stuff yeah we see traffic
on Leafly consistent high performance for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of legacy sativa hazes so blue dream
is still a number one search strain on the
[SPEAKER_00]: west coast and it dropped down below
wedding cake for a minute but it's right
[SPEAKER_00]: back on top there's a jack mafia out there
that loves jack I think it's so weird like
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a free business idea but you could
run a jack club in California and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: mailing list of like 5,000 fools who buy a
ounce of jack every month if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: promise them that it's top shelf jack
because the good stuff kind of moves
[SPEAKER_06]: around a bit it does well the jack clubs
in Oakland and they're breaking into cars
[SPEAKER_00]: every day that's the Jacker club yeah Jack
other club yeah but I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark of being able to even use the
Jack Club but I do see like the super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver Hayes fans are diehard and they
can't get enough of it I mean floor and
[SPEAKER_00]: flame even has a good super silver Hayes
that's the one yeah those are my so Chris
[SPEAKER_06]: is one of my really good friends that's
some of his Donnie burger rosin right
[SPEAKER_06]: there yes so I see a lot of rosin I'm
judging the rosin category for a change
[SPEAKER_06]: usually I judge flower but they're like
well here's rosin and then we didn't have
[SPEAKER_06]: time to switch it I'm like I'm okay I'll
do rosin too every once in a while I love
[SPEAKER_06]: judging flower because I'm super critical
over every last little detail of it and I
[SPEAKER_06]: love compared like if you give me 20
samples I'll put them in order of what I
[SPEAKER_06]: think they are just from the nose and then
I'll go back and forth between them for
[SPEAKER_06]: five or six days or seven days I do that
with all my own stuff anyway right so with
[SPEAKER_06]: rosin I have the same kind of approach and
there was there's some Donnie burger
[SPEAKER_06]: entries that I've smoked over the years
and then there's the floor of flame Donnie
[SPEAKER_06]: burger which was harvested the correct
date it has more of like a floral note
[SPEAKER_06]: it's still really unique and you could
tell that it's related to GMO but it's its
[SPEAKER_06]: own thing and I love Donnie burger in
extract and I'm not a huge Donnie burger
[SPEAKER_00]: fan for flower shut up everything coming
off GMO right now it really is holding its
[SPEAKER_00]: own and widening its lane Donnie burger
Han Solo burger double burger yeah the
[SPEAKER_00]: burgers in general we're telling people
all over the country to seek them out and
[SPEAKER_00]: find them and then we're seeing them take
home awards and if they're done right they
[SPEAKER_06]: will take home awards for sure I think I
mean I also like papaya there you know I
[SPEAKER_06]: like papaya I like white thorn rose sure
so and there's so many different good
[SPEAKER_06]: things and it's so subjective to the
moment too we're gonna put a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: strains in the leaflet Leaflet database
this year and it's not like a publicity
[SPEAKER_00]: stunt or reach goal it's just the top 50
breeders 20 strains they put out this year
[SPEAKER_00]: right that's a thousand right there and
that's not even including renames of
[SPEAKER_00]: something or a marketing push from a brand
that they're like oh we took a Donnie
[SPEAKER_00]: burger and we crossed it and now it's like
delicious burger and we want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious burger in the strain database if
people are searching for delicious burger
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna add it yeah and but they're
different and the spectrum keeps widening
[SPEAKER_00]: we are seeing aromas that you know like
the white thorn rose lane yeah that is
[SPEAKER_00]: really unique you had one back there that
smelled like rose water I just wonder
[SPEAKER_06]: where it's gonna go next I'm excited well
and really the sky's the limit we have so
[SPEAKER_06]: many guys putting effort into breeding
quality genetics I think there's a million
[SPEAKER_06]: people doing it and then there's a handful
of people that are just killing it and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it the right way really doing good
phenohunts not just making seeds you know
[SPEAKER_06]: and really the breeding side of it it's
all about the phenohunt it's all about
[SPEAKER_06]: finding something new that's where you
should get the enjoyment from I mean it's
[SPEAKER_06]: fun to make seeds too don't get me wrong
but really that phenohunt is what makes
[SPEAKER_06]: you a good breeder or not a good breeder
it's just because you can get good
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics and make good seeds doesn't mean
you're a great breeder it's the guys that
[SPEAKER_06]: are really doing the R&D and spending the
time with the plants and putting the hours
[SPEAKER_00]: in I want to see them surface that too I
want to know more about the story behind
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're bringing to market yeah so
much of what I'll see especially from
[SPEAKER_00]: overseas a lot of time we'll feel like the
the provenance is opaque I'm like where
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck did this come from what did you
cross it with where did you grow it who's
[SPEAKER_00]: your grower where are your facilities and
they oftentimes can't tell you that
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a legality yeah and they
used to have all the mojo over there but
[SPEAKER_00]: now under the farm bill we can the we can
move quick here yeah and in the daylight
[SPEAKER_00]: and the top breeders the ones that won the
awards when you go to them they can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you exactly what they did and how they did
it right and they haven't they're really
[SPEAKER_06]: transparent it's they are transparent but
the one thing I feel needs work is we need
[SPEAKER_06]: fingerprinting where whether we can submit
samples to my flora DNA or whoever it is
[SPEAKER_06]: it has a database where we can compare and
it's from the breeder and it says this is
[SPEAKER_06]: my shit and because there's so much
renaming going on and people are breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: with cuts I have skittles and I made a
cross with skittles but it was really
[SPEAKER_06]: lemon tree or it was really this or it was
really that mm-hmm yeah I mean it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wild it's a wild west time it's wide open
one thing I'm thinking about more is how
[SPEAKER_00]: to ascertain quality by cosine like a lot
of times it comes down to reputation like
[SPEAKER_00]: who will fuck with you who likes you and
so we gave archive seeds strain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year for dosy dose and it was kind of a
miss in the audience but I still fuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: archive fletch I grow his stuff I've grown
his dosy tree and it grew an actual lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: tree sized tree in my backyard in one year
so have you had the moon bow ix I have had
[SPEAKER_06]: it I haven't grown it yet so from flora
flora flame they have the moon by ix that
[SPEAKER_06]: just did he just harvested some I was he
didn't tell me it was the ix he told me
[SPEAKER_06]: was moon bow 112 but it's moon bow 112 ix
and I love that yum I love 112 as it is I
[SPEAKER_06]: know Adam from archive up in Portland and
he hooks me up with some amazing flower
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's one of the things I've gotten
from him that I just love and the ix from
[SPEAKER_00]: flora flame is amazing I believe it I was
you know we gave a strain of the year to
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent marker last year went down and
saw seed junkies facilities you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw the flavors we tasted them we saw what
was happening in the market we saw who was
[SPEAKER_00]: winning awards they clearly have a lane
that they're digging down into and staying
[SPEAKER_00]: even further ahead I just saw some new
zebra stripes that is growing out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market cherry marker I have my brothers
growing a permanent marker cross in his
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard and it's beasting out nice so
it's um I feel like there's more breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: names than ever and seeds than ever and
yet our ability to ascertain who's good
[SPEAKER_00]: and who's bad it's it's a real it's an
opportunity and a challenge you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm thinking about like how do we
surface breeder signs of quality like what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the things you can as a consumer ask
about before you spend 18 pounds on three
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for something that's essentially
like a northern lights autocross that just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of watered down whatever came over
from America yeah you know well all of
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a challenge I mean going to the
dispensary and finding good flowers a
[SPEAKER_06]: challenge because packaging you know I've
talked about on my show that I mean I
[SPEAKER_06]: can't wait for us to be able to go to the
dispensary and they have jars and
[SPEAKER_06]: chopsticks I mean I think they have it in
Missouri now you do they have it in Oregon
[SPEAKER_06]: they have deli style I love the deli style
you stick your nose in the jar you should
[SPEAKER_06]: be able to stick your nose in the jar you
know I mean and then the flower speaks for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself right and I love that I want to
work with Californians on bringing back
[SPEAKER_00]: deli style or smell jars I was talking to
one club that was like how do we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell going and I was like because they
always complain about the cost of burning
[SPEAKER_00]: a jar you know for smell sure and they're
like our margins are so low we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to put out a smell jar and I'm like
well maybe the opposite maybe you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to not put out a smell jar because
to me the smell that makes the sale right
[SPEAKER_00]: like imagine going to a banana stand
they're like you can't see the bananas you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't touch the bananas you can't smell
the bananas but you can see the packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: the bananas are $60 yeah I wouldn't buy
any fucking bananas yeah I would go find a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy who had bananas and I could like see
if I wanted banana totally and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: over regulations too much it's dumb a
shout out the artistry and what West
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollywood they got those little boxes on
chains with this poofy squishy corner and
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can smell something that's where I
picked up some permanent marker cookies
[SPEAKER_06]: has the jars with the perfect you can
smell and I think it's okay but it we
[SPEAKER_06]: really need the deli style to come back I
feel like there's just something about
[SPEAKER_00]: chopsticks that I love I know they still
regulate it like it's plutonium yeah you
[SPEAKER_06]: know instead of an herb and the places
we're regulating it they don't need to be
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated and then there's other places
like testing across the board that I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: they're trying to make improvements but
there's no consistency that needs to be
[SPEAKER_06]: run by the state a lot better or run by
the federal government eventually and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a lot of people are saying they
want less regulations well I want less
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations too but when it comes to
testing I think we need to have something
[SPEAKER_06]: that's stable across the board where
people know that you know this this 22% is
[SPEAKER_06]: really 22% and if I go somewhere else it
says 22% even though it doesn't tell the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole story it's still a determining
factor and it will still tell you somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: of how the effect we're seeing California
crack clamped down on THC inflation yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and but behind that is whether or not
those like pesticide tests are accurate or
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what pesticides they aren't
testing for babe way back in 2019 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: before times we had a rash of lung
injuries across the country from people
[SPEAKER_00]: putting vitamin E oil and pens and popcorn
lung yeah we got to the bottom of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: we kept reporting on it and we came to the
conclusion that like back four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago now that like we're gonna need
random endpoint testing and then like a
[SPEAKER_00]: random like on property testing just to
make sure you're not using one of the 500
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic pesticides that can't be in the
panel that they normally test for the 64
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide panel yeah because I mean those
might be like the usual suspects but that
[SPEAKER_00]: just automatically pushes people to the
exotic weird pesticides to get around that
[SPEAKER_00]: 64 panel for sure and we haven't seen that
done here some states like Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: affirmatively like list a bunch of
pesticides that they are okay with you
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying I've never seen EPA data showing
you can burn that stuff and inhale it and
[SPEAKER_00]: and like it's all groovy right and the one
upside we've seen lately is that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: now third-party certifications and
third-party labels for people who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: affirm that they are swear to God we're
not using us any pesticides come inspect
[SPEAKER_00]: us yeah come inspect our end product do it
anytime you want we'll pay you and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: see they're like the OCAL certified yeah
or it's like it's you can't use the word
[SPEAKER_00]: organic because the FDA right but you can
apply all those standards and and and the
[SPEAKER_00]: voters asked the state to come up with
OCAL and so now we're seeing OCAL pot come
[SPEAKER_00]: out and then jetty jetty has it on their
cards yeah you can get OCAL dabs yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you really really really can't be
exposed to any pesticides at all for a
[SPEAKER_00]: health reason you can chop OCAL now yeah
and then we have a Sun and Earth certified
[SPEAKER_00]: as well and they also claim that they are
they're they're banned pesticides list
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't 64 like the state it's like 250 yeah
and you're gonna be jumping through those
[SPEAKER_00]: hoops and so that's optimistic to me
because that's the free market and people
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing and voting with their dollars for
better versus more government right but
[SPEAKER_00]: that the missing piece is still people
making that choice and knowing the choice
[SPEAKER_06]: is available right well and I think it's
really important with concentrates because
[SPEAKER_06]: it is a concentrated version so you are
concentrating those chemicals just my two
[SPEAKER_06]: cents on it yeah but it's like man if
you're smoking concentrates you want it as
[SPEAKER_00]: clean as possible yeah a hundred percent
and I mean I'm from the medical era like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we smoke some pesticides for sure
and I mean powdery mildew for Ed Rosenthal
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2014 and they were open blasting and I
was hiding behind a tree with a notepad
[SPEAKER_00]: while the filter got jammed up in there
and they're banging on it you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: like yeah they were concentrating some
sketchy stuff and then when you
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate it and burn it some of the
like things it turns into when you burn it
[SPEAKER_00]: are really really not cool like really a
queen akin to like mustard gas yeah and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the people are like well how much mustard
gas I'm like can I have none how about
[SPEAKER_00]: none zero I'm in the mood for zero right
yeah I mean and that's where you know it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like we don't have a lot of long-term data
on the effects of these things either yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: we will eventually yeah I feel like we're
getting down this weird lane we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: bro I legalize weed I want to smoke weed I
didn't legalize shark liver oil no in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs like if you want to go put shark
liver oil in my lungs which is a vitamin E
[SPEAKER_00]: acetate you know analog go to the FDA
prove it it's safe we need to treat it
[SPEAKER_06]: look to a degree we need to treat it like
medicine even if it's being used
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation yeah I mean for me legalization
was like telling the FDA sit down about
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana we got this yeah but I it was
the marijuana the cannabis not like
[SPEAKER_00]: additives fillers dilutants yeah
thickeners there's a lot of other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not cannabis that I did not
legalize when I legalized it right and
[SPEAKER_06]: well we have this really amazing
opportunity to make the world a better
[SPEAKER_06]: place and that takes away from that
opportunity you know with with cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: and with legalization we can make the
world a better place cannabis by itself
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the world a better place my uber
driver headed to West Hollywood her
[SPEAKER_00]: husband back surgeries from football
college or high school in permanent pain
[SPEAKER_00]: on opioids though the wife was like man
I'm losing my husband to opioids and she
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even smoke she's straight but she
knows that there's like cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: you're alternatives yeah and so he was
super anti but she got him on it and now
[SPEAKER_00]: he has pain control he has quality of life
he has sleep he has he's eating right his
[SPEAKER_00]: mental attitude is better he's he's a
happy like functional pothead now and she
[SPEAKER_00]: you know just just driving me to this
party where we're gonna go celebrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: adult you side of it but the the medical
side of it is the other side of the coin
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's always right there and it's like
my career is a career of people walking
[SPEAKER_00]: them to me and saying like thanks for
writing about this cannabis gave me my
[SPEAKER_00]: life back yeah you know for all these all
these ailments totally spooky it is it's
[SPEAKER_06]: it's really wild and you know it's
subjective to the individual and I feel
[SPEAKER_06]: like there's so many uses for it and it
works differently because we all have
[SPEAKER_06]: different body chemistries but there are
profound medical benefits that we've seen
[SPEAKER_06]: especially with children and seizures 40%
reduction rate can you argue with that
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah like the these kids were dying of
incurable seizures they were going to die
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you gave them a plant oil extract
and four and ten stopped having seizures
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah just stopped and then the others sick
like six had less and the side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: were way better than the other stuff I as
a parent I would move anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world to get access to that kind of
seizure control yeah and we're still kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of at day one like I know what we're
looking into now is cannabinoids for other
[SPEAKER_00]: mental health issues like schizophrenia
bipolar and stuff I think our like the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of our lives will be dominated by new
cannabinoid therapies well Doug drug
[SPEAKER_06]: discovery through cannabis yeah you know
and plant medicine and I think plant
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine can be so vast too so we're gonna
start with cannabis and then they're
[SPEAKER_06]: really gonna dive into other whole plant
extractions I mean we had a guest a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks ago that was talking about THCV and
seek help okay I mean so like there's
[SPEAKER_06]: other things out there that we really
haven't fully explored and that's just a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole nother lane and I think that's
really exciting that's exciting for me
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean there when the cost per unit
of cannabinoids is cents on the dollar and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's legal you're gonna see it in a lot of
cosmetics yeah there's like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: control acne or control inflammation
absolutely yeah or like neuralgia like
[SPEAKER_00]: pain yeah and it's just so sad how many
people had to suffer for so long for no
[SPEAKER_00]: good reason to get to this point where
we're like you know we've had enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: the controlled substances act in this kind
of regime that we've been going about it
[SPEAKER_06]: it was for a really bad reason yeah a
handful of individuals that basically
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to take advantage of the system
yeah yeah I'm so happy people stood up and
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed their right to vote and we had
direct democracy we had enough data in as
[SPEAKER_00]: a polity as people to be like we're going
a different way there's lots of states
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have the referendum process and
they can't just stand up and vote and I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean even in Florida you got to get to
two-thirds it's not majority rules weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: legal it's two-thirds majority rules weeds
legal and they're they're close to getting
[SPEAKER_00]: there they're like right on the cusp of
getting like 60-something percent pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: wild well I mean medical polls in the 90s
percent like clean water doesn't poll at
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% no and then adult use polls in the 60s
like high 60s and it's a different era
[SPEAKER_00]: than even 12 years ago so Leafley for
example came of age in a time when people
[SPEAKER_00]: were afraid of their boss looking over
their shoulder at them looking up weed on
[SPEAKER_00]: a site so they were always really buttoned
down in demure and calm and demure about
[SPEAKER_00]: what was going on and now that kind of
reeks of trying to be a model minority or
[SPEAKER_00]: trying or like respectability politics and
in reality pot has 66 percent of the vote
[SPEAKER_00]: medical pot has 90 percent of the vote we
don't have to justify ourselves to anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: our culture is just as valid as it is
today it doesn't need to put on a suit it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need to like speak a special
language it has a right to exist on its
[SPEAKER_00]: own and the majority of people in the
country think that and de toqueville talks
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 1850s about the power of the
majority will the second the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: an americans think something if you're not
in that majority you're out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: political wilderness you're like you just
don't have any power and so cannabis won
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis people won we have nothing to
be ashamed of we have nothing to apologize
[SPEAKER_06]: for and we don't have to change for anyone
yeah and i mean it's just becoming more
[SPEAKER_06]: normal by the day you know especially
compared to the 70s 80s and 90 uh you know
[SPEAKER_06]: in the 2000s started gaining popularity
and then there was this beautiful time you
[SPEAKER_06]: know like with the early high times
cannabis cups in the u.s where it was the
[SPEAKER_06]: the vibe there was like disco it'll never
be the same i'm seeing it in places like
[SPEAKER_06]: columbia in mexico in germany and you know
spain still has that kind of 2010 vibe in
[SPEAKER_06]: the u.s where people are they haven't been
jaded yet it hasn't been fully
[SPEAKER_06]: commercialized yet and they love the plant
and you know it's so exciting i'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: mexico october uh the the beginning of
october for la trahenera canabica oh my
[SPEAKER_06]: god and so i'll be speaking out there at
the event i'm giving seeds out again i did
[SPEAKER_06]: it two years ago we gave a ton of free
seeds and there is free seed day masonic
[SPEAKER_06]: is doing his free seed day thing now
brilliant yeah and i mean these are the
[SPEAKER_06]: people that deserve it these are the
people they probably can't afford the good
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics and to have breeders give out
genetics that are quality and put those
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics in the hands of the people down
there i mean it's just it reminds me of
[SPEAKER_06]: 2010 and what i love about cannabis so
much yeah it's shocking to see the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: go so full circle because i mean again
back in the 1800s in mexico city they were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling weed out of stalls these women
were called curanderas like the cures you
[SPEAKER_00]: know um witch doctory women but they were
plant medicineists plant you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: were using plant medicine and they were
doing it because they had indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge around how powerful plants were
and when um the explorers showed up with
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp they took it into their pharmacopeia
found out all these medical properties and
[SPEAKER_00]: made it their own was like selling it back
and so the first reefer madness starts
[SPEAKER_00]: with like mexico city you know weed stalls
being like can we even have these these
[SPEAKER_00]: chicks are out here selling weed and the
ap you know associated press is like
[SPEAKER_00]: sending stories back to be able to bring
refined cannabis seeds marijuana seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: back to mexico and have them plant what we
worked on up here uh is just so poetic and
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect you know yeah i mean i made a
cross specifically for them that was a
[SPEAKER_06]: gelato times mexican haze okay and so i
have some of that here i'll show you all
[SPEAKER_06]: right it's got the haze nose like but it
also you could tell it's a lot it looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like gelato it smokes like gelato with
haze but it's more of that energetic kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of high it's not like super silver uh it's
more of a hybrid but it still has like an
[SPEAKER_06]: energeticness to it uh you know it's um
it's unique unique and it's fun that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what like i feel like whenever you go do
things like that you are tapping into
[SPEAKER_00]: being of service of the plant and not to
get spiritual or spooky but things go
[SPEAKER_00]: better for you when you align yourself
with what the plant wants to do well at
[SPEAKER_06]: the end of the day we're all just stewards
of the plant it's not our plant we're just
[SPEAKER_06]: here to add add some part of ourselves to
it and to its legacy because it has its
[SPEAKER_06]: own legacy right and so we have our legacy
but our job as stewards is just to impart
[SPEAKER_06]: part of ourselves into it to move the
plant along so other people can do the
[SPEAKER_06]: same you know we don't we don't own it
even though it feels like i own these
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics i made this well man we're
working on the backs of the guys in the
[SPEAKER_06]: 60s and 70s and they're you know even 50s
60s and 70s and the the explorers and the
[SPEAKER_06]: guys that went out and got those seeds
from afghanistan columbia all over india
[SPEAKER_06]: you name it and you know this plant's been
in existence forever yeah at least 2000
[SPEAKER_06]: years in medicine chinese medicine even
3500 years yeah 3500 years and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing that we've moved the plant to
where it is now and now we have all these
[SPEAKER_06]: different flavors and i'm trying to take a
refocus into effect yeah where i kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: went away for and i was all about flavor
for the last five years and really
[SPEAKER_06]: refocusing myself back into the effect of
the plant and i think that's so important
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's also recognizing without ego that
we're here for the plant and to move the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant forward not the other way around
yeah um uh michael paul and the botany of
[SPEAKER_00]: desire talks about four different plants
that got humans to do their bidding and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was one of them similar to like
dogs you know we think we domesticated
[SPEAKER_00]: them but we've taken dogs all over the
world and the cannabis gene wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread to every biome in the globe and uh
it did not have anything going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: americas as best as we know it we know
until the spanish explorers brought the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp over but the second it landed like it
just colonized the whole continent and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lasting thunderfuck all the way
down to probably some like chilean tier
[SPEAKER_06]: del fuego fuego totally and then we got
jamaica we got islands with cannabis you
[SPEAKER_06]: know hawaii's got their thing going on
they've been doing it for quite a while um
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and all the you know the slaves
that did bring this stuff to jamaica yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and um it's called the columbian exchange
and this idea of like old and new mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: so potatoes went from peru to ireland
tomatoes went from here to italy cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: came from over um and we spent the last
you know 500 years mixing global genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and were not done the plants not done with
us doing and spitting no you know no and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's something that we were meant to
consume we wouldn't have these receptors
[SPEAKER_06]: in our bodies if we weren't meant to
consume it and it wouldn't make us
[SPEAKER_06]: healthier i don't think but yeah we have
all these receptor sites and we're just
[SPEAKER_06]: scratching the surface of the medical side
of it which i love the fact that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: still pushing it forward and we're still
in this golden era in certain ways you
[SPEAKER_06]: know i feel like maybe maybe people
consider the golden era that you know pre
[SPEAKER_06]: what we're at now but i feel like with
medicine and plant medicine and science
[SPEAKER_06]: and being able to use ai and computers to
drive the breeding and i mean i think the
[SPEAKER_06]: potential is just really wild where we can
go and now that we understand sequencing a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot better imagine 10 years from now when
we can really dial this stuff yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: also we're seeing the end of the single
plant single molecule single target
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to medicine which is very useful
with penicillin and anything else yeah but
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some medicines that resisted the
single molecule single target paradigm
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is one of them they just threw
their hands up and go well it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: obturage there's a lot of shit in there it
works better when it's all together yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: even a pity olex is has entourage it's not
just cbd in an oil they found a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize it as like a whole plant
extract yeah so that like gw
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals knows you need the other
stuff in there even if they can't validate
[SPEAKER_00]: the other stuff you know in these eyes and
the cool thing now is like you can use big
[SPEAKER_00]: data and surveys and come at it from the
other end and been like when we give this
[SPEAKER_00]: to a million people and they all got back
to us and there's something here here
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all reporting nausea anti-nausea
they're all reporting better sleep they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all reporting less depression less anxiety
with leafy the reviews we get it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: clear if a strain is more arousing than
other strains yeah uh wedding cake has
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong arousing signals from our
consumers like they are smoking it and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it on and logging on and more than
average you know because people would say
[SPEAKER_00]: well any weed will make you horny maybe
but some cultivars some chemo bars some
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo types are are a standard deviation
above the average and there's like a list
[SPEAKER_00]: of them and so and that like every effect
can be come at from like a big data point
[SPEAKER_00]: of view where we can just set aside trying
to find the thing out of the whole mix
[SPEAKER_00]: that is doing the thing we can just go
well it's this whole thing and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: give it all like this thing kind of pops
out at the end and you can go spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: next two generations figuring out what in
wedding cake is making people horny well i
[SPEAKER_06]: think the the bigger thing is is like we
have wedding cake and we can figure that
[SPEAKER_06]: out but once you have 20 different things
that have the same effect then we can
[SPEAKER_06]: compare and we can see where it's coming
from and what part of the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids terpenes or flavorants you
know i think the thials have now been
[SPEAKER_06]: renamed i mean there's still thials but
they've also been renamed flavorants you
[SPEAKER_06]: know if we're talking about sulfur in the
plants yeah volatile sulfur compounds now
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely i mean abstracts tech wrote
those white papers and kind of changed the
[SPEAKER_06]: game thank you i'm glad they did yeah i
mean we need people like that we need
[SPEAKER_06]: people pushing it forward and especially
you know using their minds and doing it
[SPEAKER_06]: the right way to where some of these
studies are funded by companies some have
[SPEAKER_06]: you know i feel like some of these people
are just saying stuff to say stuff and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can really get supporting data from almost
anything i mean like they genuinely those
[SPEAKER_00]: guys genuinely love fucking weed yeah and
i think that's important because we had
[SPEAKER_00]: this era where like people like it's all
the thc and then we did we were like found
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or like it's all the terpenes
right but even at leafy you'd see things
[SPEAKER_00]: the same top three terpenes that were just
different right and you're like i smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: all this weed and you're telling me these
two things are the same because the top
[SPEAKER_00]: three turps are the same and i'm telling
you they're not the same right you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have to keep going and abstracts did
keep going and they found some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's at the part per million level at
the billion level much smaller molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have outsize effects which is so
obvious to me that like just like not all
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules are created equal they don't all
have the same sized effects like one
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule can have an a thousand times
action at a receptor than a different
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule and so wait just waiting them in
sheer amounts doesn't get at the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: story it's like a side post but you have
to have be humble and hold space for like
[SPEAKER_06]: what we still don't know right and i mean
i think a lot of us just contributed
[SPEAKER_06]: citrus to limonene and they proved that's
wrong you know it's like stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's or the amount of limonene
right like one a little can do smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing and a lot can smell like another
and then when you add three and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things at other levels and then all the
things you can't measure you end up having
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of default to be like man trust
your nose trust what you like trust what
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a good experience i i it's so
simple you know when we're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that be simple for our audience and not
overwhelm them or make them feel dumb and
[SPEAKER_00]: so i'm so proud to be able to go back to
the audience and be like just smell weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoke what you like for a while and
maybe write it down or check it on leafy
[SPEAKER_06]: you know collect data points on yourself
because some people you know they smell a
[SPEAKER_00]: chem and they're like i remember getting a
panic attack from that smell yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like no and good don't hit that
yeah even if it has a chemo type that's
[SPEAKER_00]: someone said is like exactly what you need
no like smoke something out you smell a
[SPEAKER_00]: lavender and you're like oh this smells
like my favorite girlfriend from freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: freshman year like try that mom's perfume
or whatever it is yeah um and trust your
[SPEAKER_00]: nose i you know as far as i know the sense
of smell is the first sense to to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the womb yeah and then um it's the
strongest memory trigger so they will use
[SPEAKER_00]: smells in memory care facilities with
people with dementia and alzheimer's to
[SPEAKER_00]: help like bring them back to a moment or
bring them back to reality wow and i know
[SPEAKER_00]: like i could visit a room i hadn't been in
in 20 years with my eyes closed and i
[SPEAKER_00]: could smell that room like a basement or
something i know exactly where i am
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely and i think weeds like that too
and we think it's probably because our
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of smell of volatiles in the
environment kept us alive yeah like you
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to eat the right thing or if you
ate the wrong bitter berry you died if uh
[SPEAKER_00]: you did it disacknowledge the animal that
was stinky or like a skunk yeah you maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't pass on your genes and um and i
think i i have a little bit more uh heart
[SPEAKER_00]: for people that say i don't like the smell
of weed it smells like skunk i think what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to say is that some lower
part of their limbic system is afraid yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: like some part of them that they aren't
even conscious enough has been like there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a fucking skunk around here yeah i
don't want to get sprayed because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are a caveman and you got hit in the face
with like a skunk you're gonna have a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: day you might not even make it to the next
day there was no ketchup back there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: ketchup there was none of the things you
could use to wash it off that's the cure
[SPEAKER_06]: by the way if you get sprayed by a skunk
or your dog does it's uh bathing in
[SPEAKER_00]: ketchup yeah but now like my dog gets
partially skunked and i'm like smells like
[SPEAKER_01]: brake pads like someone's burning brakes
or chronic what's going on like right now
[SPEAKER_06]: i honestly love in small doses love that
sprayed skunk smell and we we were you
[SPEAKER_06]: know i think the new term is roadkill
skunk or whatever but like we didn't we
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't have roadkill skunk when i was a
kid we had skunk and we didn't even call
[SPEAKER_06]: it skunk we had you know but we had this
strawberry we used to get from santa cruz
[SPEAKER_06]: that was skunk weed it was as skunky as it
got but it was the shape they called it
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry because it was strawberry
shaped buds yeah yeah that shit is stanky
[SPEAKER_00]: and awesome and uh i'm all about it the
cariophyllines in combination with some of
[SPEAKER_06]: those volatile sulfurs those nose burning
sulfurs oh yeah i mean we had cat piss too
[SPEAKER_06]: that was like ammonia that's lost right
for me it is i mean the thing is with cat
[SPEAKER_06]: piss is is the description of an aroma and
so my opinion is is that there's 10
[SPEAKER_06]: different people that had a cat piss and
they were different cat pisses potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: and so their cat piss may still be around
but the one that i remember it was like
[SPEAKER_06]: straight nose burning ammonia i have yet
to see it but dave from buttolero gave me
[SPEAKER_06]: some sour diesel when i was at reggae on
the river we became good friends after
[SPEAKER_06]: that uh and that sour diesel is the real
cut and i've been looking for real sour
[SPEAKER_06]: diesel for a long time how did he keep it
going he's had it for 21 years where how
[SPEAKER_06]: he's in mendocino okay yeah i mean he's an
amazing guy we're uh yeah we're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about doing some fun projects together but
he kept it alive and he didn't share it
[SPEAKER_06]: with a lot of people and i have some here
to show you too and it's the real deal
[SPEAKER_06]: when you squeeze it if you know what sour
smells like you'll be like yeah that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: real sour it also makes me feel like
there's only one real sour um you know
[SPEAKER_06]: because i've seen so many different
versions of stuff especially in the last
[SPEAKER_06]: year and a half two years that's really
gassy that's not it i think there was one
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour and it came from like an
original chem and it broke into og and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to hold on to because genes
drift or you grow them bad or it gets sick
[SPEAKER_00]: and you kind of have to keep pulling the
crank on the slot machine and try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: three cherries again like i think the
genes to make sour are in there it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like how can we resurrect them again like
well so the next thing is for us to test
[SPEAKER_06]: it at my floor against sours that we
already have and i have a feeling that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's some truth to what you're saying
in regards that we may already have it but
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not able to make that plant express
like he's making it express to get the
[SPEAKER_06]: sour yeah we have like seven different
sours i think uh in tissue culture yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: and out of those seven i have yet to see
one that expresses like his does where
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like oh yeah i feel home that sour
you squeeze it you're like smells like
[SPEAKER_06]: early 2000s sour diesel what i love about
sour that it's it's citrusy it's not just
[SPEAKER_06]: gas it does have that gas it does have
like that a little bit of that burnt tire
[SPEAKER_06]: you know like latexy kind of like strong
gas but it has way more complexity because
[SPEAKER_06]: it has this the citrus that that basically
backs it up in this funk it's like a lime
[SPEAKER_00]: rind to me it is it is it's like a that's
a good description versus like a sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like orange or orange juice or a
lemon juice lemon juice or a liar lemon
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like lime rind or you know there's
lime zest too right so there's lime i mean
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the thing about citrus people think
they categorize citrus all in this one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing but really if we start breaking down
the aroma of citrus what i love i always
[SPEAKER_06]: love talking about this because as a chef
it's like there's so many different uses
[SPEAKER_06]: with citrus you can use the juice you can
basically make a candy version of that
[SPEAKER_06]: smell so like a orange candy or a lemon
candy we can go into the zest we can go
[SPEAKER_06]: into the rind because you know like tangy
some of the tangies you get that rindy
[SPEAKER_06]: orange which i like and so there's and the
citruses are different like the grapefruit
[SPEAKER_00]: like in a squirt oh yeah i love grapefruit
too yeah it's just soma's grapefruit soma
[SPEAKER_06]: had that new york city diesel that was
like a big yielder and it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: straight grapefruit terms yum huge fan so
i'm an unabashed tangy lover squirt lover
[SPEAKER_00]: uh i i think it's a crowd favorite you
know forbidden fruit i shout out garden of
[SPEAKER_00]: eden and hayward yeah they had they
introduced me to the forbidden fruit fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: shout back in the day shout out
charifatree i like forbidden fruit um i
[SPEAKER_06]: like tangy too at the right time tangy's
kind of fallen off yeah but it was the
[SPEAKER_06]: most awarded awarded cross for the longest
time in that early high times america cup
[SPEAKER_06]: it was winning every time dna was getting
on stage multiple times whether it was for
[SPEAKER_06]: the flower or the extract yeah you know i
mean just killing it yeah i think like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where it crosses over into fashion
right um some turps are not fashionable
[SPEAKER_00]: the way some sneakers aren't like some of
our followers will not be caught dead in
[SPEAKER_00]: a6 right they will not be caught dead
smoking jack they can't afford the like
[SPEAKER_00]: hit to their social standing they think
comes with it and then there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: people that don't give a fuck they just do
wear the shoes that make them feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable or the strains they like um i
just had to have respect and space for
[SPEAKER_00]: both i i've grown squirt multiple years
from humble seed co yeah which is a tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross and it's the first one that my
friends all take all of it like it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: because it actually smells like the soda
squirt yeah and um i respect the pull like
[SPEAKER_00]: if your jar goes empty first that's the
jar yeah that's the jar test that's what
[SPEAKER_06]: we do too we write a jar test is always
like what's gone first right and so me i
[SPEAKER_06]: always have lots of jars and that's really
my test too is like what did i gravitate
[SPEAKER_06]: towards the most because whatever's the
best is usually what i smoke the first
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately yeah i might go for other
stuff but i go for what the best stuff is
[SPEAKER_06]: like if i got some amazing skittles i
might smoke through all that yes uh but if
[SPEAKER_06]: i have friends come over i might want to
show them some other stuff too like i that
[SPEAKER_06]: super silver from flora flame you know
that's a crowd favorite too i do you do
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing where you like have the house
wine that you give out versus like the
[SPEAKER_00]: head stash so you're like you know let's
save this for someone who really can
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it for sure for sure and then
you probably do the same thing we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: i have if i finish a jar that's notable
yeah because we have a lot of flour in our
[SPEAKER_00]: lives and we can pick and choose and so
like if i actually get to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: your jar wanting to smoke it all despite
having a bunch of stuff like that goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the like short list of like stuff i
currently like you know yeah or if my
[SPEAKER_06]: friends are asking for something that i
had like a month or two later you know and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like it's been gone for a month now i
don't have that anymore and i could talk
[SPEAKER_06]: to my buddy he's got another batch coming
down or whatever uh sf canna grows some
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing stuff they do i'm a big fan of all
their work i just did a tour with grow
[SPEAKER_06]: world we did a tour of the sf canna
facility with chris nice um yeah yeah they
[SPEAKER_06]: grow a bunch of my genetics uh we we fino
hunt together a lot of fun stuff so um
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you uh what are you what lane are
you sort of digging into like a minecraft
[SPEAKER_00]: miner who's on some diamonds like going
down down down i'm i'm looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: something different obviously right now
the boxes you gotta check you gotta have
[SPEAKER_06]: color it doesn't have to be black anymore
we've gone away from that but you need
[SPEAKER_00]: color like a oreo is black or i hate oreo
yeah we all do i mean i hate oreo but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: one cross away from being good i know all
these things are purple punch i dislike it
[SPEAKER_06]: it's one cross away from being amazing um
to put some tangy in there i mean
[SPEAKER_06]: permanent marker crosses are great i love
those i i have
[SPEAKER_06]: several lanes that i'm going down and
basically express which is the hardest
[SPEAKER_06]: part of the fino hunting process you have
to be a good grower if you're just growing
[SPEAKER_06]: them and you're just like they're not
gonna be that different but if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: actually putting the time in and you grow
really good flour then it's like okay this
[SPEAKER_06]: out of 20 different seeds they're all
slightly different you know and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: part of the magic i also am going into
some wild stuff we got fort collins cough
[SPEAKER_06]: times banana skittles okay we got
shoreline times banana skittles i haven't
[SPEAKER_06]: released those yet but we're fino like a
strawberry cough fino fort collins cough
[SPEAKER_06]: no the fort collins cough is an nl5 haze
okay so kind of like the pif uh there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a bunch of things you know the nl5
haze has been around there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: reiterations of nl5 haze fort collins
cough is from fort collins uh colorado and
[SPEAKER_06]: it is a spear looking apical dominant
plant that shoots up and just you know the
[SPEAKER_06]: average plant grows like two inches a day
this thing will grow four and it just
[SPEAKER_06]: keeps growing and you flip it into flour
and it just i had a 11 foot tall plant in
[SPEAKER_06]: my house when i was making seeds of it and
it was like four feet wide 11 feet tall
[SPEAKER_06]: like a true christmas tree like a true
yeah it was like a what is it a not
[SPEAKER_00]: scooby-doo it's a charlie brown christmas
yeah uh i think with new york going legal
[SPEAKER_00]: the pif wave has really ticked up a notch
people want to see pif they want to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into a store and buy their old pif i got a
tissue culture we got the cuban black and
[SPEAKER_06]: tissue culture we've got the fort collins
we got a bunch of new york favorites uh
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah the pif i think i i love the pif
i love the pif because i'm a flavor guy i
[SPEAKER_06]: like the effect too because it's it's like
a i wouldn't say it's a diet haze but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: a more mellow haze good and in a good way
right where i can smoke a whole joint of
[SPEAKER_06]: it it's super silver i like sharing joints
of it but if it's the middle of the day
[SPEAKER_06]: and i smoke a whole joint of super silver
i may want to change my plans for the day
[SPEAKER_06]: whereas pif i can stay on task it keeps me
kind of level-headed uh if you smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: extract made from pif too which i i got to
do it's it's super special too but like
[SPEAKER_06]: that was my workout one where i just take
we got this little dipper you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter oh yeah i was just in new york and
i rolled up a j a pif haze at a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: store and smoked it and i won't tell where
but i was not ready to go from like inside
[SPEAKER_00]: a basement smoking pif haze to back onto
the streets of manhattan oh wow chelsea
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like full sativa like heart
palpitations like what the fuck am i doing
[SPEAKER_00]: next like what was the plan like i have
made a terrible mistake so pif is an
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting one because i feel if you
harvest it a little bit early it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: little more mellow and a little more
floral and it's got its own thing going on
[SPEAKER_06]: flavor wise yeah it does have that
terpenaline limonene kind of hazish
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristic okay but it also has like
this unique like it's it's almost floral
[SPEAKER_06]: incency and really good pif i feel like it
burns down to the roach and it just tastes
[SPEAKER_06]: it tastes even better when you get down to
the roach it's like one of those ones it
[SPEAKER_06]: just keeps getting better and better and
better in flavor do you think like some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these unworked genetics from 40 years ago
can stand up to the new new because i see
[SPEAKER_00]: the development that's happened between
the plant structure and the yield and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that grew versus like the hot rods of
today i honestly think all this stuff so
[SPEAKER_06]: dave from buttolero he's on a mission to
bring back old and unique genetics and
[SPEAKER_06]: different stuff and he's gonna do god's
work and in ways that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't even understand but like to go in
and hunt through land race genetics it
[SPEAKER_06]: takes a lot of work and you're gonna get a
lot of bad stuff to find the good stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah you'd be reselecting you're be you're
reselecting you're doing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: original work all over again they got us
to the point where we're at and i love
[SPEAKER_06]: that it has a place he has some african
haze that's just super special right i
[SPEAKER_06]: have some of that too and then he has some
of these pearls from this this land race
[SPEAKER_06]: african it's just yeah it doesn't even
smell amazing it looks terrible but the
[SPEAKER_06]: high from it just special and it lifts you
up nice and gently for about 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: where it creeps up on you it's not like
the creeper where you don't feel it you
[SPEAKER_06]: feel it but it keeps getting you more high
for about 15 minutes and then you mellow
[SPEAKER_06]: off good and i really that's when i talk
about going back to breeding for effects
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like that's what it gets me excited
so now we have some different effects
[SPEAKER_06]: we've got the uh the white thorn rose
right so that is a field i call that feel
[SPEAKER_06]: good weed agree uh and dave that passed
away uh i don't know if you knew dave
[SPEAKER_06]: messford damn it dave dave damn it okay uh
from seattle he was with canna con okay
[SPEAKER_06]: and also hemp fest he was he's legendary
he's legendary i heard quote he bought a
[SPEAKER_06]: house with the canna con money um like he
did good with it he did really good with
[SPEAKER_06]: the you know he was driving around an
orange truck for the longest time and he
[SPEAKER_06]: did really well and he put on an amazing
event and you know with hemp fest too like
[SPEAKER_06]: he's the one who got me to go to hemp fest
um he took photographs of me when i was in
[SPEAKER_06]: high times for the first time yeah and so
when i was in publications he did that in
[SPEAKER_06]: 2012 after i won the cup in amsterdam and
really nice guy we became really good
[SPEAKER_06]: friends passed away on 420 but he had the
blue 13 and that was blueberry haze times
[SPEAKER_06]: louis the 13th from kevin jodry that's
gonna kill shout out to kevin jodry shout
[SPEAKER_06]: out kevin the same exact effect same exact
as white thorn rose okay just from a
[SPEAKER_06]: different vector just from a different
vector it's green white thorn rose is
[SPEAKER_06]: purple but they have the same makes you
feel good like it was eerie smoking them
[SPEAKER_06]: and kind of being one of the only people
uh besides carrie boyder from montana
[SPEAKER_06]: who's a gondier we had both had the
experience that we met at dave's a
[SPEAKER_06]: memorial service and both of us had the
same thing we realized we weren't crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: that we've got the same effect and that's
kind of part of what made me want to breed
[SPEAKER_06]: for effect because that stuff is special
and i feel like most people i'd say the
[SPEAKER_06]: average person in the united states maybe
in the world if they were to experience
[SPEAKER_06]: that they would be like i really like weed
i really like cannabis because it makes
[SPEAKER_06]: you feel good it's not overly strong yeah
it's not sedative it's not narcotic so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's neither one of these sides of the
spectrum it's somewhere in the middle and
[SPEAKER_06]: it makes you feel amazing and i feel like
as a chef it's what i want to give people
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like this is what i want you to try
because it makes you feel so good so even
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're a lightweight or you're somebody
who doesn't really think you like cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: but you're kind of curious about what your
friends are doing that's the one and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know we we need a little bit more of that
you know because we have so much of
[SPEAKER_06]: everything right so it's like we're in
this world of instant gratification you
[SPEAKER_06]: there's 30 million gelatos we have this
handful of haze and sativa's blue dream i
[SPEAKER_06]: like blue dream with strawberry coffee you
know i like strawberry cough too same i
[SPEAKER_06]: got a jar at home yeah kyle came on the
show gave me a jar and uh yeah we smoked
[SPEAKER_06]: it was really good um it's it's pretty
strong right it's strong in a good way but
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah it's strong we smoked it on the show
and it was like uh yeah it was good my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite effect strain right now might be
the canna country 26 nice it's purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: it reminds me of an old afgu yeah or an
afgui i love old afgui and the old afgui
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't the terpiest it was like a hash
strain and but it was it was sweet on the
[SPEAKER_06]: nose but it was the most frostiest where
you look fake yeah and like it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: super dense or chunky yeah like uh it's
not checking some box but it's winning the
[SPEAKER_00]: race because of the effect where whereas
like i have a dark rainbow at the house
[SPEAKER_00]: from uh happy trails and it's like a 37
percenter that smells and looks great but
[SPEAKER_00]: my god if i don't get a panic attack every
time i smoke it so it's funny because
[SPEAKER_06]: coffin candy i feel like it's 37 percent
and as far as effect it's strong but it
[SPEAKER_06]: like makes my eyes super tight and it
makes me just it's the narcotics right in
[SPEAKER_06]: a good way in a good way but like yeah
those 37 percenters some of them can be
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost too much sometimes yeah and
like sometimes i want that i'm playing
[SPEAKER_00]: like hell divers too with my buddies and i
have like kids are asleep and i don't mind
[SPEAKER_00]: getting my pulse up or taking a mental
inventory of like all my curt enemies or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you know but like you're like
like i'm wicking out and it's fine but in
[SPEAKER_00]: general i think people want euphoria they
don't want dysphoria they want to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good they don't want to feel bad well even
the animal face can get right on top of a
[SPEAKER_00]: newbie that you have on the desk oh yeah i
mean it's called animal face it's from
[SPEAKER_00]: face off og like fudge doesn't lie like
it's a ripper yeah but i mean it's
[SPEAKER_06]: something for everybody it's so subjective
to the individual because sometimes people
[SPEAKER_06]: want that stimulant to calm them down yeah
and sometimes people want that narcotic to
[SPEAKER_06]: make them feel normal you know it's it's
so funny because it's so individualized
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's why doctors have such a hard
time with it it's like they don't know
[SPEAKER_06]: what to recommend they tell someone they
should try this and then you know there's
[SPEAKER_06]: no standard effect it's so complicated and
for them to wrap their head around plants
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine for the most part if they're in
western medicine it's really difficult i
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's how i discovered strains was
the first one was for me was blue dream
[SPEAKER_00]: you know i was on the beat starting in 09
and i came into it definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: believing that strains existed because i'd
go to your dealer and you'd have like two
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds right like lavender and og yeah and
you can you can take it or leave it you
[SPEAKER_00]: have it or what um but they said you know
strains are a real thing they have
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects i'm like get out of here
you know like go on and there would be pcs
[SPEAKER_00]: had like actual strain cards back in the
day uh baseball cards and blue dream was
[SPEAKER_00]: on one and it promised that 50 50 hybrid
effect and it you know people were using
[SPEAKER_00]: it for anti-anxiety and back then i
definitely had anxiety and i sought that
[SPEAKER_00]: out and it worked and i was like well son
of a bitch you know like this is my
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine for my anxiety those playing
cards were awesome yeah i mean yeah so
[SPEAKER_06]: berkeley uh patients care collective off
telegraph avenue david bowers uh yeah so
[SPEAKER_06]: there was eric and dave yeah and so yeah i
mean people have heard my blue dream
[SPEAKER_06]: nightmare story like i call it the blue
night why we still refer to it too as the
[SPEAKER_06]: blue nightmare because one year i had
harvested a bunch and eric and dave had
[SPEAKER_06]: promised to buy five pounds of it okay and
this is the year that blue dream got
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivated by everybody but it i grew the
best blue dream at the time and my friends
[SPEAKER_06]: can all attest to it being the best it was
sticky nice and it was chunky and the
[SPEAKER_06]: pounds of it you'd open it up and you'd be
like wow this is amazing and blue dream's
[SPEAKER_06]: not hard strain to grow anyway it's very
easy to go fun so come you know christmas
[SPEAKER_06]: time i'm hoping to buy gifts for everybody
pay all my bills i just harvested this
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing flower i bring my five pounds in
there right and i put it uh on the table
[SPEAKER_06]: and i'm like what's up and he's like i got
some bad news so he's like unfortunately i
[SPEAKER_06]: can't pay 32 for this we bought some for
18 and i 'm not gonna be able to buy those
[SPEAKER_06]: five pounds oh i was like oh i don't know
what i'm gonna do because i see what they
[SPEAKER_06]: look like and i see what you bought for 18
i can't imagine that it's gonna be that
[SPEAKER_06]: good yeah comes out it was actually for 18
was really good yeah it wasn't as good as
[SPEAKER_06]: what i had but for half price i mean it's
hard to argue so basically we had to
[SPEAKER_06]: borrow money from my parents knife in the
heart and it held i still got my money for
[SPEAKER_06]: the flower but it wasn't until like way
after christmas i started getting money in
[SPEAKER_06]: january and february but uh you know those
are the kind of stories that make i feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like this year that's gush mints everyone
grew a fuck ton of pcg gus mints well so
[SPEAKER_06]: gush mints the reason they grew gus and
the reason people grow gush mints is
[SPEAKER_06]: because it comes out really good in
greenhouse or outdoor right especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: hedgerows of it like yeah there's
thousands and thousands and but it beasts
[SPEAKER_06]: out and it's quality it looks it's frosty
it's you know it's covered in trichomes
[SPEAKER_06]: the structure is good some people are
passing trying to pass it off as indoor
[SPEAKER_06]: it's what happened with blue dream where
people didn't want blue dream so they
[SPEAKER_06]: changed the name to something else it's
blue lagoon and it's like what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_06]: blue lagoon yeah you know but like the
same thing is happening with gush mints
[SPEAKER_06]: they're like no this is kush mints i'm
like no this is gush mints so and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like and it tastes good too it's
another one that actually tastes good when
[SPEAKER_06]: you smoke it and so it kind of checks the
box it's like the new blue dream it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go in effect but um it's what the
market wants and it's a real great
[SPEAKER_00]: exemplar of what we've seen now is that
like cannabis strains have life cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah they have like a beginning uh like
they get born they get taken up someone
[SPEAKER_00]: wins an award the interest ratchets up it
hits a peak where it's being overproduced
[SPEAKER_00]: and the price falls and the quality slips
and fashion moves on right and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down down down and it either fully
peters out to where we get zero page views
[SPEAKER_00]: on that strain for the last month like
there's literally no one in the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: even fucking googled that strain right or
it has another cycle or it becomes like a
[SPEAKER_06]: classic like a classic yeah i mean so
shout out to c junkie for wedding cake and
[SPEAKER_06]: ice cream cake but those plants have their
their day the wedding cake really had its
[SPEAKER_06]: day it was super popular same thing with
the ice cream cake facts and i still like
[SPEAKER_06]: ice cream cake yeah don't argue with me on
that people it's good ice cream cake is
[SPEAKER_06]: you know it got overproduced but because
it was good yeah but because it was
[SPEAKER_06]: especially because it was good you know
not because it yielded or anything else
[SPEAKER_06]: even though it yields fine it's because
it's smoked good and it smelled like ice
[SPEAKER_06]: cream when you opened up the the bags or
the jars of it it really smelled like ice
[SPEAKER_06]: cream creamy desserts and the extra tastes
just like that too it's like one of those
[SPEAKER_06]: ones you can pair with desserts it's so
good i was i recall like all the cakes
[SPEAKER_00]: score high on the arousing thing on leafly
people are using them on date night and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting it on wedding cake and ice
cream cake and one other thing we've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: is like remember when covid happened and
they'd be like oh a new variant came out
[SPEAKER_00]: and at first it's like one percent of all
samples and then it's like 40 percent and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it's like 50 percent and the variant
like crowds out the competition right i
[SPEAKER_00]: see that happening with strains like it
emerges and it's one percent of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the next year it's 10 and the
next year it's like a good 50 yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just in success of waves of newly
fit strains colonizing vast vast chunks of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market like outsized chunks and
there's no reason to think it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: equal a thousand strains everyone gets a
thousand like one one thousandth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market no one strain gets 40 percent of
the market and the other nine thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: fight over the remaining 60 dude rs 11 and
zoe petty a huge foothold for the longest
[SPEAKER_06]: time it's still going it's still going
it's moving east it's moving for sure it's
[SPEAKER_06]: moving east and people don't want to hear
rs 11 right now and i love rs 11 i like
[SPEAKER_06]: soap a lot too but like uh yeah it's like
smoking black soap this week maryland
[SPEAKER_00]: legal maryland yeah i'm so happy for them
that's great like they are like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop a cell phone in the bush yeah and
they go from like nothing to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: newish shit right and like you got to
watch out for those populations because
[SPEAKER_00]: they take things up intuitively without
the baggage yeah and um and then they do
[SPEAKER_00]: uh revolutionary uh sort of heretical
things that actually are at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: new things right you know we're so
precious with our ogs over here they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna flip black soap into like black
maple and we'll be smoking east west coast
[SPEAKER_00]: will be smoking east coast maple soap next
year yeah for sure yeah it's really wild
[SPEAKER_06]: so for for our viewers that don't know
exactly what leaf lee is or how leaf lee
[SPEAKER_00]: works yeah i want to explain that yeah i
mean um leaf lee's been around for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: years it's got like 9 000 strains in the
database leaf lee's the like internet's
[SPEAKER_00]: number one weed source and people are in
the parking lot hooking up from their
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer looking up uh like um coffin candy
and seeing if the picture matches and the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell matches they're using the site for
validation on the illicit market there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like 8 000 stores menus on leaf lee now
and you can get pickup and delivery so um
[SPEAKER_00]: in in canada uber eats and leaf lee will
bring you a burrito and a joint um yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and we just like they just turned on
another province up there and so that like
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf lee's got to put new strains in the
database every day as like it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: heartbeat because it started with the guy
who loved weed so much that he started a
[SPEAKER_00]: spreadsheet and you know what that's like
to start putting weed in a spreadsheet you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to love it a lot and be pretty dorky
about it to like start down that road but
[SPEAKER_00]: once you do you know um it like they ended
up with a big competitive advantage the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains are a big moat for them and it's
basically what the universe wants that
[SPEAKER_00]: company this company to do like uh strain
breeders don't go to the united states
[SPEAKER_00]: patent and trademark office they don't go
to the california secretary of state they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't spend five million dollars pulling a
patent patent they just release it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the market get it on leaf lee and like
fight about it in the comments and
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly the guy that pushes it the
hardest and sells the most wins the name
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you know and um there's no guild that
is saying oh you can't use this name it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already been taken so our job is to wait
in there every day and disambiguate and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like actually there's two sherbert hazes
one's a gelato haze and one's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset sherbert haze they're both being
called sherbert haze they're grown by
[SPEAKER_00]: different people they're actually very
similar but that's what's going on there
[SPEAKER_00]: like no one's wrong it's just people need
to know what's going on and um so this
[SPEAKER_00]: year we are going to put you know again i
think thousand strains in the database
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about five a day and then we do 12
to 15 monthly news stories that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: laser focused now on strains and products
um it's an undiscovered country it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: final frontier i've been doing this for 15
years and we've the new the like the the
[SPEAKER_00]: law side seems more inevitable than ever
we're at like 28 legalization states are
[SPEAKER_00]: now 25 or you can lose track it's
happening so fast and 40 something medical
[SPEAKER_00]: like i'm less interested in like the turn
a screw around a legislature like like
[SPEAKER_00]: normal outlets write about weed laws now
what's wide open is digging into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars the genetics the breeders their
stories like operating thesis is that like
[SPEAKER_00]: um there's a universe in every nug like
you can use it like a keyhole and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: you look in and through it you will see
the strange genetics the breeder how it
[SPEAKER_00]: was grown where it was grown why it was
grown where it fits into why we're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're growing and the whole culture
and all of history like back to like the
[SPEAKER_06]: ships coming over when the value of this
is so huge from if you look at the future
[SPEAKER_06]: of it right so over time what happens is
the amount of data that you collect can be
[SPEAKER_06]: used for breeding and creating these huge
trees of data you know and we want to know
[SPEAKER_06]: where it came from 50 years from now i
mean you guys are setting the bar for the
[SPEAKER_06]: data that will be collected 50 years from
now and how we can compare and contrast
[SPEAKER_06]: and look at what was popular now and you
guys collect data on top of all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys have algorithms and we i get to
see like which states are smoking what and
[SPEAKER_00]: like in what order and you can see strains
move from west to east across the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see them go from like zero
page views to like a top 100 in the
[SPEAKER_06]: country like a billboard music charts well
and for predicting trends there's nothing
[SPEAKER_06]: better than collecting data point to data
points to predict trends yeah and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can combine it with smoking everything you
can get your hands on you can really be of
[SPEAKER_00]: value to this audience and that's like i'm
the head of brand experience over there
[SPEAKER_00]: slash senior editor they rely on me to
like serve this audience and stay close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and that means like growing it
it means making seeds it means i did the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest book with ed marijuana harvest in
2016 it means walking the fields i'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: headed back up to humble the first week of
october judging in these contests getting
[SPEAKER_00]: your hands really dirty with it and um and
uh and so you can tell a story that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience in the same room with um the
the best of the best yeah um and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: next layer on that for me is doing these
experiential things so as of weed week in
[SPEAKER_00]: april as of hash week in uh july and i'm
gonna do it a seed show in december it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like i'm so fed up with people not being
able to get what they want after reading
[SPEAKER_00]: them about it that i'm like fine just come
over here you meet moon valley moon valley
[SPEAKER_00]: is great at growing living soil you should
learn about living soil you all right like
[SPEAKER_00]: buy buy this pre-roll now it just won the
emerald cup it's like it's like putting
[SPEAKER_00]: their hands together being a connective
tissue i love it and your events are
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing sf weed week was great i'm glad i
was able to be a part of it thanks for
[SPEAKER_06]: turning up absolutely i mean like last
minute super positive it was great it was
[SPEAKER_06]: great and i think you you've really picked
a lane that could use improving a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people jump in the lane where everyone
else is in it's popular event planning is
[SPEAKER_06]: something that we need more of and not
even more of we need more good events it's
[SPEAKER_06]: really difficult to organize something
that lasts a week let alone a day dude you
[SPEAKER_06]: know i can't even imagine you know and
it's it's a lot of work and so really
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive thanks it was like um doing a
magazine where you have 12 stories you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to land at the same time yeah you know um
it's a lot of planning but it's all every
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those drops is a breeder with a
story and a strain with a story and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in a place that has a story and
so programming a series of them that way
[SPEAKER_00]: uh was possible and our big breakthrough
and i encourage anybody to do this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: like center of the plant like find a
subject matter expert that does everything
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's going on right now and have
them like pick your lineup um you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw stuff people do cannabis bingo and
cannabis fashion and people weird weed has
[SPEAKER_00]: this weird tendency to make people digress
right and and so they take it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to take your eye off the plant when
you're being like trying to serve it um
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like oh we're talking about osha
now and i'm like well okay maybe but this
[SPEAKER_00]: the tropes he just came out like how how
did they even get a tomahill haze to put
[SPEAKER_00]: with the gdp to put with the xeno and um
and so you know those stories centering
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and having really really really
good weed or really really good hash at
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of your weed or hash festival
yeah um made it way easier because um then
[SPEAKER_00]: you just build out from around it um
callia and nasha and these other hash
[SPEAKER_00]: makers are they have audiences akin to
indie rock bands right and so they're your
[SPEAKER_00]: headliners yeah and you can make a poster
and put them on it and a normie white be
[SPEAKER_00]: like what's callia and nasha but a wook is
like oh yeah this is going to be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: week of all time totally and it's
literally me being like this if this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best i could find yeah let me bring
this together um one other thing was like
[SPEAKER_00]: you couldn't pay to be on the poster like
a headliner it was like when they program
[SPEAKER_00]: outside lands you don't get to pay to be
on the stage like you just have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great musician like chapel rone's having a
moment yeah you pay chapel rone and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't like pay to get on our slate you you
have to earn it and show up on the radar
[SPEAKER_00]: uh and so that that putting that at the
center everything else is kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly assembles underneath because
people are like i want to be at that i
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be i want to stand next to that
yeah um and so like i encourage everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: to just like don't forget the if you want
to be original don't forget the origin
[SPEAKER_06]: here yeah yeah well i'm doing an event
october 2nd dabadoo with mila we got sam
[SPEAKER_06]: from rosentek is co-sponsoring the event
with me miss chris is going to be the host
[SPEAKER_06]: where the mc well we're i was going to
talk to you about the location that you
[SPEAKER_06]: got it's chronic culture is great but it
doesn't have as many people as i'd like
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah to be able to attend and something
like the dabadoo we allow for free entries
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you give if you give us an entry
we'll limit it to like 30 per category you
[SPEAKER_06]: get a ticket and so i'd like to have an
event where we can have 150 to 200 people
[SPEAKER_06]: and judges kits and we're going to do
t-shirts and obviously sam is with uh
[SPEAKER_06]: focus v and you know he's got his they've
got the yeah the focus v and we've got
[SPEAKER_06]: rosentek yeah and we're gonna get some
badass extract artists out there it's
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna be a lot of fun yeah and it's the 10
year anniversary of dabadoo right which
[SPEAKER_06]: has had gone all around the world hasn't
it wasn't in barcelona barcelona yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: nickatee duggy and i did the 2014 dabadoo
in the bay area and she's just had it's
[SPEAKER_06]: touched so many people's lives and it's
been a lot of fun i've gotten to a bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: of dabadoos in my life and being able to
contribute that with sam i think mila is
[SPEAKER_06]: like family for both of us she's just a
really special person and sure so bring
[SPEAKER_06]: her out here her and i almost died
together you know on a boat on a boat okay
[SPEAKER_06]: i took her sailing with my friend oh god
we hit another boat we were in the bag you
[SPEAKER_06]: know what yeah you gotta hear the story
from mila it's even better because it's so
[SPEAKER_06]: exciting but yeah we went out on the bay
and we went sailing out of salcelito it
[SPEAKER_06]: was like the gilligan's island day where
it was like beautiful and then it got
[SPEAKER_06]: stormy on us a little bit and the winds
picked up and you know the bay when the
[SPEAKER_06]: winds pick up it could be crazy out there
yeah two boats both decided to start
[SPEAKER_06]: turning the same direction and boom hit
each other in the bay yeah pretty wild but
[SPEAKER_06]: uh we both lived in the water no we did
not go in the water okay nothing no no we
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't go in the water it wasn't that
crazy afraid of sharks i'm not afraid of
[SPEAKER_06]: sharks at all in the bay okay yeah i mean
uh i don't you know i don't think you need
[SPEAKER_06]: to be afraid of sharks in the bay there's
sharks in the bay but like i'm not afraid
[SPEAKER_06]: i would i would be more afraid of the cold
than i would be of the sharks yeah for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure yeah the cold will kill you in an
hour right i do cold plunging and i could
[SPEAKER_06]: handle it but it's still cold that's still
like especially for long periods of time i
[SPEAKER_06]: mean some people might pass out after five
ten minutes yeah people they might make it
[SPEAKER_06]: an hour and some people might get
hypothermia and other people they just can
[SPEAKER_06]: handle it where are you gonna do dabidu uh
we are looking for a spot yeah we're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for a spot right now and i was
gonna do it literally i was gonna hit you
[SPEAKER_06]: up after the show asked you if you want to
be involved i'd love to so yeah and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna be a fun event and uh yeah i mean
it's just it's super i feel like it's
[SPEAKER_06]: kickback and simple it's coming up in like
a month and a half yeah so yeah hash uh
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2014 has had a lifetime happen to it
10 years right yep from like open blasting
[SPEAKER_00]: with butane and just basically like bubble
hash curling irons yeah and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: curling irons and and now this tech like
we're reporting on the static tech people
[SPEAKER_06]: so static is really really cool i get
excited about static uh full melt static
[SPEAKER_06]: is so amazing and so good and so many
turps and i just i love it because if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're using water there's water soluble
terpenes right that you lose right yeah um
[SPEAKER_06]: and anytime it's going through a process
whether it's co2 or bho you're changing
[SPEAKER_06]: the chemical composition of it slightly
yeah whereas sift you are not and i love
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking good sift it's just amazing um
yeah there's something special you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it's so you got to keep it cold
and then you have to kind of press it okay
[SPEAKER_00]: you do yeah right off there god what was
that like that sounds amazing it is it's
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing and you know so i remember the
first time i got scissor hash back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: day yep and static reminds me a lot of
scissor hash like good static you know yay
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah i mean some of the turps that we
used to get off the scissor hash was the
[SPEAKER_06]: best and like we all we should trim for
free all our friends we trim for each
[SPEAKER_06]: other we grew we go over to somebody's
house we never charged them by the hour to
[SPEAKER_06]: trim maybe you get some weed or whatever
but like back in the mid 90s there was it
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't like that we'd hang out we loved
weed we loved trimming for each other same
[SPEAKER_06]: and when we harvested we needed help i
needed help so i would you know there was
[SPEAKER_06]: times we had we run trim trim crews out of
my house my wife would man it if i was
[SPEAKER_06]: there and i had a water plant she would
run the trim crew and uh you know and it
[SPEAKER_06]: evolved more into a trim crew that got
paid but in the beginning it was like we
[SPEAKER_06]: used to watch the in living color when it
came on dvd that was what we watched over
[SPEAKER_06]: and over in fact i think i still have i've
saved those because it's so nostalgic the
[SPEAKER_00]: dvds and they have resin on them still i
must have been like 2012 when i got some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first really high-end hash from
spark that like like liquefied when you
[SPEAKER_00]: applied heat and so it ran yeah i don't
know if it was a co2 or what it was but um
[SPEAKER_06]: in 2012 yeah and so see so i used to sell
in 2012 i sold co2 to spark i was hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: i wanted to say like i hit that the only
way i could find a way to hit that shit
[SPEAKER_06]: was hot night feed it into a cup so it
didn't look like peanut butter it looked
[SPEAKER_06]: it was like more of like a yellowish
peanut butter consistency very light so i
[SPEAKER_06]: used to sell that spark and so my friends
in fresno they basically bought this eden
[SPEAKER_06]: labs extraction machine and it's like this
rocket ship right and they're like we're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna make hell of money and so they made
it and uh they couldn't sell it to save
[SPEAKER_06]: their lives and so i was already selling
flour to spark and so i started bringing
[SPEAKER_06]: in jars and they were they paid $20 a gram
for it back in 2012 it was crude it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: what people would like to see today but at
the time it was great they used i believe
[SPEAKER_06]: they used it in edibles and other things
as well and co2 was a cleaner bhl product
[SPEAKER_00]: right that's how people viewed it yeah i
mean we had bubble and then there was that
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is again now for 12 years ago and
so we're from a generation that like hot
[SPEAKER_00]: knifed like i love hot like i was in
mazelon and i tried to put it in a local
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe with the titties on the pipe and it
just ran right through it was like gone i
[SPEAKER_00]: just got over my mouth you know and i was
like i'm gonna have to hot knife this i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even this is before the internet
really so you couldn't even google like
[SPEAKER_00]: how to hot knife you just had to like give
it a go yeah for sure you know and like
[SPEAKER_00]: catching in the cup and then sipping the
cup and is that how you use it we used to
[SPEAKER_06]: use the uh tubes for the uh paper towels
that was the hot knife and you would you
[SPEAKER_06]: would put them together and then kind of
push them in a little bit not really in
[SPEAKER_06]: but like enough to where the person could
take the hit and those that sounds better
[SPEAKER_06]: because we were sipping from the cup yeah
they were yeah you get a big hot knife hit
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was it was like taking a hot dab
right but but with hash typically that
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't the same quality as what you would
dab and it would wreck your throat yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: cough sometimes no matter what you would
cough you don't even know yeah now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: live rosin carts all in ones that are
superb so i love half grams gram rosin
[SPEAKER_06]: carts i don't like one gram i feel like
half gram because by the time you get to
[SPEAKER_06]: the half gram it's about to be not as good
okay and so at room temperature and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything else two gram carts is crazy
that is they're super popular right now my
[SPEAKER_06]: buddy was saying two gram carts are the
new thing and everybody wants them and i'm
[SPEAKER_06]: like how could that be because when you
get done with the gram it's gonna be shit
[SPEAKER_06]: by the time you get to the end of two
grams you i won't even smoke it i'll give
[SPEAKER_06]: it to somebody i would never i guess
they're just gonna do whatever they could
[SPEAKER_00]: think of we're also seeing the two carts
or the three cars or four carts and one
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing so you can just stick that
whole thing monster hits and i mean
[SPEAKER_06]: innovation though right like you got to
come out with 90 things to get 10 good
[SPEAKER_00]: ones or 99 to get one good one sometimes
yeah i mean it's like fine no scruples
[SPEAKER_00]: show us what you like tell us how it goes
you know well and i'm excited about cryo
[SPEAKER_06]: technology i think for trimming drying and
curing there's a couple companies we're
[SPEAKER_06]: about to have on our show and i think yeah
well i'm excited for the potential of it
[SPEAKER_06]: so far i've been disappointed but i know i
have trouble like i don't want to smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: astronaut ice cream right yeah where it's
like the bud looks big and beautiful and
[SPEAKER_06]: like super light and it looks like it's
still on the plant almost dude we're just
[SPEAKER_06]: not there yet we we potentially will be
but there's a lot of things that happen in
[SPEAKER_06]: that drying process and the curing process
that need to be mitigated for you to get
[SPEAKER_00]: good flour and i'm not even sure what's
happening like there needs to be phd's
[SPEAKER_00]: written about like what's happening in
your chlorophyll levels versus your water
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the resin because like we're seeing
with drying and curing that like some
[SPEAKER_00]: things are degrading some bad things are
degrading right and then eventually enough
[SPEAKER_00]: of them to grade that the good things kind
of stand out well and i think what happens
[SPEAKER_06]: with the plant is that when you are going
through the curing phase the stomata has
[SPEAKER_06]: to stay open to keep the moisture from you
want to release the moisture from the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant so this right and co2 will lock the
stomata up and so with the turp locks
[SPEAKER_06]: which we are both huge fans of we both
collaborate with turp locks their benefit
[SPEAKER_06]: is that when you put them in there the
lining absorbs the co2 preventing the
[SPEAKER_06]: stomata from closing allowing the moisture
to leak out of the plant or yeah into the
[SPEAKER_06]: into the bag whereas you don't have to
burp it for the longest time you burp it
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets rid of excess co2 all that stuff
yeah and like the air somehow keeps things
[SPEAKER_00]: going uh growers talk about how oxygen is
like salt you want to like you cook with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little of it too much bad but you need it
and um have you seen this where like you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a jar and it's not great and but you
flushed it by opening it and trying it
[SPEAKER_00]: like and then you put it away for a while
and it cures into a good spot and you open
[SPEAKER_00]: it again and you're like oh there it is
totally um and now i feel i know and it
[SPEAKER_00]: feels very unnerving because it's hard to
write off stuff that's just not cured yet
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be the best the growers so
excited to give it to you um but it needs
[SPEAKER_06]: two weeks that happens a lot for me too i
get stuff when it's super fresh it
[SPEAKER_06]: happened the other day with some skittles
and they look like the most amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: skittles and like i smoked it and the same
cured out stuff normally has like this
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing white ash oil ring tastes like
cantaloupe a little bit it's like on the
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit they harvest it really early so it's
not the gassy side of skittles it's more
[SPEAKER_06]: like candy cantaloupe turps and when you i
love it but then this stuff didn't have it
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was like kind of let it was so
fresh but uh you wait two weeks good to go
[SPEAKER_06]: burns clean all of that uh you know i'm a
huge turplock fan yeah and i don't i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fully know why i know there needs to be
phds where they like go and have like the
[SPEAKER_00]: control group the mod is closed because
they flash it you know well so jack from
[SPEAKER_06]: turplock yeah he's huge into rnd and so
he's done a lot of stuff uh i love the
[SPEAKER_06]: work that they're doing they're featured
in my book uh but i got rid of my jars and
[SPEAKER_06]: the thing is is i'm one of those trust but
verify sort of people with turplock i was
[SPEAKER_06]: like a disbeliever i was like no mylar oh
dude it's just another thing to believe
[SPEAKER_06]: well it was a hard sell for me because
i've been using my lars forever not a fan
[SPEAKER_06]: i prefer my glass jars and so over the
last couple years i've gotten rid of the
[SPEAKER_06]: not even a couple years but in the last
year pretty much my glass jar collection
[SPEAKER_06]: has gone way down i put stuff in turplocks
i do like jars sometimes i put my
[SPEAKER_06]: turplocks in jars so they don't get
smashed yep because that's the one thing i
[SPEAKER_06]: don't like about the bag is you can put it
in your pocket and just we still don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know go we'll know what's going on with a
good old-fashioned wide mouth like ball
[SPEAKER_00]: jar yeah because it's something it's i
mean i love looking at it and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: there's the c vault too i think those are
cool but there's something special about
[SPEAKER_00]: glass mason jars and maybe it's just
nostalgic because of our age too where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like no i think it cares like it got
to me and maybe though science will
[SPEAKER_00]: disprove us wrong but like it gets better
when you get it on glass and in a ball jar
[SPEAKER_00]: and cure it versus it staying in the
turkey bag yeah um turkey bag yes turplock
[SPEAKER_00]: i think is better i know that's the word i
mean i came at it as like uh the my bag as
[SPEAKER_00]: like a um reporter i'm getting hundreds of
uh uh samples a year yeah and i never have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough bags i'm like wadding up paper with
nugs in them that i've written on the
[SPEAKER_00]: paper because people are handing me stuff
yeah and or i would get a bag that was
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate like a ziplock baggie or an
all black one where you had to write on
[SPEAKER_00]: with like a silver sharpie who's walking
around like a silver sharpie um luke
[SPEAKER_00]: scarmazzo yeah and so i had these
reporters notebooks and i knew what fields
[SPEAKER_00]: i need to report um and i also care a lot
about turps i have a joke facebook group
[SPEAKER_00]: called the turp conservancy like the
nature conservancy and it's like no turp
[SPEAKER_00]: left behind it drives me crazy when i
smell turps because that's our money and
[SPEAKER_00]: our our time and our water and our
nutrients and all this effort just like
[SPEAKER_00]: off gassing in a room from a bag that like
someone carelessly left open you know
[SPEAKER_00]: right um i i even in stores like if i'm
smelling turps in a medium hot store i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: mad because like that's the stuff in the
things the biggest problem with the rec
[SPEAKER_01]: market in my opinion what's going on with
colorado what was up with those pop top
[SPEAKER_00]: jars they were using that just didn't even
seal you know i'm talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical bottles oh dude and they're at
like 5 000 feet and 30 humidity the driest
[SPEAKER_06]: place and i'm like yeah well you know and
then washington's the most human play or
[SPEAKER_06]: you know as far as the polar opposite
they've actually dialed in their packaging
[SPEAKER_06]: i feel like they've done a lot better job
but uh yeah dude like but it's so critical
[SPEAKER_06]: like that's the it's like you spend all
this time and then to just fuck it up at
[SPEAKER_06]: the very end but also i have a problem
with the way flowers being brought to
[SPEAKER_06]: market where sometimes the consumer
doesn't get it for six months that sucks
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what i mean and also it takes you
know they deliver it in the middle of
[SPEAKER_06]: summer in an unrefrigerated truck and then
the dispensary doesn't have refrigeration
[SPEAKER_06]: and so even if it's only two weeks old
it's been exposed to this hot temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: for a few days here hot it's not going to
be as good right every little thing it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like a piece of a pie where you're at 100
you take something away from that pie
[SPEAKER_06]: every time you fuck it up just like when
you're growing in that 70 day of flower
[SPEAKER_06]: every little mistake takes away from that
pie i've been there sometimes it's one
[SPEAKER_06]: percent sometimes it's two percent
sometimes it's 50 yeah if you miss a day
[SPEAKER_06]: and it just turns like a z and turns on
you dude yeah one one day because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: like a life in a human year right like for
the plant one day is you can really go
[SPEAKER_06]: downhill you can go downhill you can total
one day can be catastrophe i do like how
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an agricultural product it
has a peak you're holding something that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't forever ostensibly i mean you can
put some of these hashes away for years
[SPEAKER_00]: but in general um if you get something
great you get a good batch from a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: at his prime you're just seeing a view
from a mountaintop that's not guaranteed
[SPEAKER_00]: the next time right um the weed gets old
they there the plant gets sick the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts a corner um it's never stable like
the the really good stuff like holding on
[SPEAKER_00]: to consistency month after month is
probably like the hardest thing um and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what keeps it ever exciting to me
is like it's ultimately like it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: sop-able as i mean you can have sops but
it's still life and so it's squirreling
[SPEAKER_00]: out from underneath your sops and fucking
with you um and the end product can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: like that as locked in forever um yeah
there's ways you can preserve it a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit yeah you can have cold temperatures
you know below 60 degrees if you really
[SPEAKER_06]: want to go for it and you'll maintain the
quality and turplock bags or even jars or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever yeah like maintaining a cold
environment it'll stay fresher a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: longer i know guys that you know some of
these guys that don't even trim it they'll
[SPEAKER_06]: put it in bins and then right when they
sell it is when they trim it they keep it
[SPEAKER_06]: in these cold rooms in totes or in uh you
know clear plastic containers and so they
[SPEAKER_06]: can look at it all the time but i like
that a lot too because i feel like those
[SPEAKER_06]: sugar leaves protect the flower they do
house of cultivar shout out there they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like their own innate boveda is like if it
gets wetter the sugar leaf sucks up the
[SPEAKER_00]: water right and if it starts to dry out
the sugar leaf gives up the water and the
[SPEAKER_06]: bud stays in there i believe it's part of
a longer cure too so like as as you know
[SPEAKER_06]: we have the stem and the stem is where a
lot of that moist because of the density
[SPEAKER_06]: of the stem a lot of that moisture holds
on to the into the stem longer than the
[SPEAKER_06]: actual flower and then if you have sugar
leaves on there and what happens with the
[SPEAKER_06]: cure is you may have the perfectly dried
bud where it snaps but there's still
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture in that stem and if you do it in
those bins it'll slowly go through the bud
[SPEAKER_06]: go into the leaf and then you have a
perfectly it's an outlet right exactly it
[SPEAKER_06]: buffers it a little bit right it buffers
that moisture i i've definitely chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: off a bunch of leaves when i've harvested
and not and i i'm on team not i just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of chop and hang and do let the plant live
and breathe and expire versus make a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of cuts all over it that's just where i'm
at as a home grower who's trying not to
[SPEAKER_00]: try so hard and i i think like in my heart
that like oftentimes doing less is the way
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah yeah so my personal back in the day
because i was for one reason i was like
[SPEAKER_06]: lazy with my own personal but i put it in
mason jars on the stem i would you know
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously we put in totes uh burp it out
and then they would go in jars and other
[SPEAKER_06]: people's the stuff that was for sale would
get trimmed perfectly and then my stuff it
[SPEAKER_06]: would go in jars with leaves on it yeah
farm cut yeah and i love that i still love
[SPEAKER_06]: that and i you know finger trim we'd
finger trim it you know just poop beep
[SPEAKER_06]: beep oh yeah meditative yeah for sure
before that we used to trim wet yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a big thing you know i know and
everyone's got a reason yeah um but my
[SPEAKER_00]: best results have been doing less and and
dry trimming yeah and um i got no problem
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a little trimming you know a pound
here and there it's meditative keeps you
[SPEAKER_00]: in contact with the plant yeah you know
how some cultivars are a delight to trim
[SPEAKER_00]: another or a nightmare and that
satisfaction of like getting deep down and
[SPEAKER_00]: snipping like a water leaf right at the
bottom of it and like not hurting the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plan and having this big pile that
you're like how did we even get all that
[SPEAKER_00]: because you just did this little bit every
day and you kept your head down it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: such a good metaphor make precise cuts
don't look at everything just take it one
[SPEAKER_06]: day at a time take the bits when you're
teaching people how to trim i always
[SPEAKER_06]: remember this because what i would do is i
would if there was new people in the room
[SPEAKER_06]: i would trim a gram up put on the table
i'd say you need to do one of those every
[SPEAKER_06]: minute and you'll have a pound so
basically in 454 minutes you'll have done
[SPEAKER_00]: a pound yeah right yeah it's usually a day
right there you can get through it a day i
[SPEAKER_06]: mean i know trimmers that trim two pounds
a day now five pounds a day my you know
[SPEAKER_06]: using the brush tech finger trimming and
brush tech if you do it but that requires
[SPEAKER_06]: the right kind of flower and the right
kind of node spacing you want good node
[SPEAKER_06]: spacing with very little leaf and then
those uh trim brushes are amazing yeah i'm
[SPEAKER_06]: a huge so that's another one i was like
this is stupid right for the longest time
[SPEAKER_06]: is this is stupid and then this this has
happened throughout my whole life in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry i'm like this is stupid or this
is i don't like this i'm so so over that
[SPEAKER_06]: way of thinking but with the trim brush i
was like oh this thing looks like a
[SPEAKER_06]: barbecue baster brush it's gonna knock the
trichomes and it's gonna knock the
[SPEAKER_06]: trichomes that's what i thought too yeah
obviously i think most people think that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's very like it you know but it's how it
works is you have to use the right
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature and humidity so if you're at
60 60 and you go for 10 days at 60 60 and
[SPEAKER_06]: then your room you have it yeah you can go
even like 50 for the first day or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: some people do different but 60 humidity
60 degrees where the trichomes are pliable
[SPEAKER_06]: but they're not gonna snap off okay but
it's not so hot that it's taking away from
[SPEAKER_06]: the turps yeah affecting the flavor
negatively and what happens is you get the
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves that are they they become brittle
uh-huh right and so if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of leaf it makes it a lot easier for
either finger trimming or using the the
[SPEAKER_06]: trim brush the orange you know the orange
bristles with the white handle yeah cut
[SPEAKER_06]: that big handle off so you get this little
thing in your hand and you can really it
[SPEAKER_06]: becomes really meditative if you do it
right because there's a specific motion
[SPEAKER_06]: you can go back and forth where you're
spinning this stem with one finger and
[SPEAKER_06]: going across and it gives you the best
shape i feel like you're not able you're
[SPEAKER_06]: if you have trimmers they're not able to
snip the tops off or round the buds you're
[SPEAKER_06]: really getting in there and doing a good
job and you can do four to five pounds a
[SPEAKER_00]: day like that if you grow the right flower
okay because i've definitely been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry room where like it's dry and if you
just even look at the goddamn plant wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see little trichomes like floating
off in the air you know like they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready like a lot of it has to do
with temperature and humidity yeah so if
[SPEAKER_06]: you dial your temperature and humidity in
they and if you get it too cold obviously
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll be brittle and they'll break off
right okay so you don't want it too cold
[SPEAKER_06]: you want that 60 60 or and it's a it's
like it's a five degree range you know
[SPEAKER_06]: like 60 to 65 you're okay with humidity i
like that cold temperature your trimmers
[SPEAKER_06]: are gonna hate it but at the same time
it's not about the trimmers it's about the
[SPEAKER_00]: best end product possible apparently like
um wine went through this where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like god dang by the time we get this wine
to texas it's pretty warm and ruined can
[SPEAKER_00]: we like get some refrigeration going yeah
and now all wine's on a cold chain well
[SPEAKER_06]: you know who started that well actually
you know who started it with beer actually
[SPEAKER_06]: originally is laganitas brewing company
praise be to the cold chain yep so tony
[SPEAKER_06]: and jeremy uh they're featured in my book
i talk about in my book and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing uh i used to work with laganitas a
lot and they basically were the ones that
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted laganitas to be the same wherever
you go we want the same experience for the
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer right and so anchor steam i had
this experience with anchor steam where
[SPEAKER_06]: you got it in texas it was terrible right
because it wasn't refrigerated held
[SPEAKER_06]: properly or liberty ale is so good but the
second you bring it out of san francisco
[SPEAKER_06]: and drink it in oakland it's not as
laganitas super consistent across the the
[SPEAKER_06]: board because they would use refrigerated
trucks for delivery and then that evolved
[SPEAKER_06]: to not just laganitas but other people in
the industry doing it they got acquired by
[SPEAKER_06]: heineken heineken started doing it now
everybody pretty much does it uh heineken
[SPEAKER_06]: is no longer skunky like it used to be and
if you drink heineken now and you never
[SPEAKER_06]: had a skunky version of heineken it's a
heck of a lot better now than it used to
[SPEAKER_06]: it used to be this skunky you don't even
think about it no it's not it's a very
[SPEAKER_06]: clean crisp i think of it more as clean
and crisp whereas like it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky and funky uh we need to promulgate
like a cold chain protocol and just give
[SPEAKER_00]: it away to the pot industry so we can hold
on to those terps you know we're like i
[SPEAKER_00]: think you got to keep it under 60 65 yeah
well we need to pull tony mcgee out of
[SPEAKER_06]: retirement and get him in the cannabis
industry getting these refrigerated
[SPEAKER_06]: delivery services you know as far as uh
distribution companies that are all
[SPEAKER_06]: refrigerated show us how it's done yeah i
think there's people you know there's
[SPEAKER_06]: people that are watching the show they're
like oh yeah they do it and it's like yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: there are a couple people doing it there's
pieces of it there are people yeah there
[SPEAKER_06]: are pieces of it people have good
intentions we talk about it now we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: execute yeah soulful keeps ac pointed at
their flower wall so the flowers if like
[SPEAKER_00]: you touch the glass they're chill it's
like 55 that's nice it's perfect yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: i think yeah like if you're leaving um a
grow uh like if you're chopping down
[SPEAKER_00]: plants i don't know that they never ever
should get above what 60 65 yeah somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in there like the colder you keep it so
the terpenes i get as a consumer and then
[SPEAKER_00]: go with god it's on you right to not leave
it in a hot car flavorants terpenes flavor
[SPEAKER_06]: molecules are volatile and so the warmer
it gets the faster they go away some are
[SPEAKER_06]: more volatile than other ones uh and it
changes and so the cooler we can keep it
[SPEAKER_06]: the better the product is at the end of
the day i want the best product possible
[SPEAKER_06]: for my consumers uh you know my my thing
is seed so i just want to empower the
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation partners that i have and so we
do a lot of r&d on stuff like with
[SPEAKER_06]: turplock when i first got it we basically
had a turplock a mason jar and then we had
[SPEAKER_06]: a turp turplock mason jar and turkey bag
and we had those and they sat on the shelf
[SPEAKER_06]: it's 16 degrees same exact strain from the
same batch from the same trimmer and i had
[SPEAKER_06]: those three sitting and i checked them
once in a month you know and we it's all
[SPEAKER_06]: anecdotal data i should have probably sent
it to the lab each time and we'll do that
[SPEAKER_06]: again but basically it was my nose because
i was taking a little bit out smoke and
[SPEAKER_06]: they were all fine for the first two
months okay and then you started noticing
[SPEAKER_06]: that the turplock was fresher and then
after month three it was more apparent
[SPEAKER_06]: that the mason jar was better than the
turkey bag sure and there are different
[SPEAKER_06]: turkey bags so because i think they're
polyethylene material or whatever okay
[SPEAKER_06]: damn it there's not just one kind no and
there's ones that are thicker and ones
[SPEAKER_06]: that are thinner and so obviously the
thicker ones are going to be less porous
[SPEAKER_06]: than the thinner ones because all of it
has pores right and then um with the mason
[SPEAKER_06]: jar the mason jar was the next to start
kind of changing on me and then after six
[SPEAKER_06]: months it was very obvious nice uh
turplock turplock was was the one and then
[SPEAKER_06]: you know my buddy buddy lance my good
buddy lance works for turplock yeah so we
[SPEAKER_06]: did a collaboration with lance and with
turplock and i featured them in my book
[SPEAKER_06]: and i feel like uh it's it's a great
product and it's innovational and
[SPEAKER_06]: especially it's innovation a little thing
that i didn't think could be innovated
[SPEAKER_00]: upon talks for me polymer science it's got
to be crazier than ever and uh i think
[SPEAKER_00]: they did a good job with it that's why i'm
rocking the the note bag for sure yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: well and their competition will be like
well it's just hype it doesn't work it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like no i mean i thought that too and then
i did the test and the thing is is go do
[SPEAKER_06]: your test quit telling me what you think
you show me the test where it's not better
[SPEAKER_00]: and i'll show you the test that is i'm
ready to get radical about sealing like
[SPEAKER_00]: learning the science of like a good seal
like like because theoretically you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want any like micro mole like zero atoms
right exchanging right like and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently yeah you line has good bags um
i don't know i just like again in pursuit
[SPEAKER_00]: of like keeping the turps where they're
supposed to be yeah i can't control like
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in my household that leave bags
open but well they had the nitrogen you
[SPEAKER_06]: know infused where they they they had a
nitrogen blanket that yeah they basically
[SPEAKER_06]: flushed out the oxygen it would be like a
nitrogen blanket and that was popular with
[SPEAKER_06]: the cans right when they had the tuna cans
for a while and that went away you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-oxidize them then and they have to
reopen up again because they'll just smell
[SPEAKER_06]: flat when you get in there right and
that's why they went away right so it's
[SPEAKER_06]: it's funny but we're still learning i mean
that's the one thing i'm excited about and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's so many things that are
counterintuitive where i'm like oh yeah no
[SPEAKER_06]: that's stupid and i've learned to like eat
my words over and over and right you got
[SPEAKER_06]: to be open-minded you got to be
open-minded especially now where we're at
[SPEAKER_06]: look at leds like there's so many things
that even if you thought you weren't
[SPEAKER_06]: open-minded before but you've been in this
industry where you didn't like leds and
[SPEAKER_06]: now leds are the ones they're good they're
good they're really good they've gotten a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot better feminized seeds they sucked in
the beginning i was good auto flowers
[SPEAKER_06]: that's another one where i was like no way
auto flowers are bunk and then i make auto
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers now i love good auto flowers
they're dude really good auto flowers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there as if like there would be any other
way like of course it's going to start out
[SPEAKER_00]: bad and they're going to get better like
the rockets don't just start out landing
[SPEAKER_00]: on on the on themselves like they fall
over and explode a few times until they
[SPEAKER_00]: get them right and then there's all this
baggage right like oh leds oh autos
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the space like we're i'm smoking
perfectly great led weed yeah and we're
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing amazing autos there's companies out
there i'm not going to throw them under
[SPEAKER_06]: the bus or anything like that but i know
they're using auto flowers for their bags
[SPEAKER_06]: and i know because they're using my auto
flowers but uh you know and they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: ready for that truth no they're not people
aren't ready for the truth and it might
[SPEAKER_06]: hurt their sales right but the truth is
these guys are crushing it dude they're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing great and the flowers good and you
know and we're talking about stuff where
[SPEAKER_06]: they can grow outdoors they can plant in
may and finish in july have flower on the
[SPEAKER_06]: market you know i think that's huge uh you
know there's companies up in sonoma and
[SPEAKER_06]: lake county that are getting three poles a
year and they're just starting to fix
[SPEAKER_00]: strains so to take out all heterogeneity
like strawberry seeds and traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: crops so like you can like clones you can
plant a row and everything you get an auto
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going to grow the same oh they're
super consistent now with the some of
[SPEAKER_06]: these breeders are breeding you know
there's a handful of breeders doing really
[SPEAKER_06]: really really amazing work and then
there's a lot of closet guys and guys
[SPEAKER_06]: doing small production but you have to go
to at scale what i learned with auto
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers is to breed auto flowers properly
you need to breed them in scale so you
[SPEAKER_00]: need a big gene pool to select and it's
still day one i tell people like we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't come up with a cotton gin for
cannabis yet like it's still all hands
[SPEAKER_00]: which is medieval technically yeah um and
so that means cannabinoids when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: automated are going to be like just the
lifeblood that you'll swim and you won't
[SPEAKER_00]: even notice them they'll be so cheap on
one end in like skincare products for
[SPEAKER_00]: example but on the top end we're seeing
the rosins the live rosins go for 100
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks a gram yeah that's like uh more than
the cost of gold per gram so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing gold now we're dabbing gold here
the golden age i love it i love that and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know i'm i'm one of those guys who uh
don't tempt me because you got two grams
[SPEAKER_06]: of skittles for 200 bucks i will buy it
yeah the buckets the baller buckets
[SPEAKER_06]: totally i mean i will i don't mind
spending a hundred dollars a gram if it's
[SPEAKER_06]: something because a gram can last me a
long time with this little thing i can
[SPEAKER_06]: make a gram you know i have friends that a
gram might last them a day yeah and then
[SPEAKER_06]: if i have them over i mean i might need to
hide that a little bit but not that i do
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know for for me i can make two
grams last me a good month maybe longer i
[SPEAKER_06]: have so many different things to select
from people are have such different
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerances you can see it in the medical
literature you can take someone up to like
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand milligrams a day and back down
they're fine yeah versus like taking
[SPEAKER_00]: someone up to a thousand milligrams of
like hydrocodone a day or whatever be dead
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah um and so some people and then
their incomes range so much that for some
[SPEAKER_00]: like 100 bucks is like a round of drinks
with the guys yeah and so yeah i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: spend a gram on that i'm gonna get a bunch
out of it a lot more than like 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: for a round of drinks at a pricey bar in
san francisco totally we're gonna get two
[SPEAKER_06]: big fat hash or whatever whatever it is
dude yeah like that's the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is the joints have gotten
bigger i'm all about the big you've seen
[SPEAKER_06]: my joints i i do yeah three and a half
grammars i'm just learning i'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting up the skill yeah where you're
just like yeah well you know what i mean i
[SPEAKER_06]: think it's actually easier to roll bigger
joints once you dial it in it's i think
[SPEAKER_06]: it's easier because i don't even roll
small joints anymore because i can't roll
[SPEAKER_00]: them as good as i roll the big the bombers
yeah i mean yeah that's a function of how
[SPEAKER_00]: like the price per unit going down like
this was like unfortunately college to
[SPEAKER_00]: like a month's worth of weed or two weeks
or whatever well i'm loving the like such
[SPEAKER_00]: a crazy era we're in with seeds with the
hemp bill yeah that i have to like um do
[SPEAKER_00]: my best to bring together the west coast
genetic scene after the harvest before
[SPEAKER_00]: christmas and that's where this idea for
this event turpnami is coming from and my
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is to get 20 breeders at 20 tables
over two days nice um for like a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: growers commercial and home growers um on
december 7th and 8th in the city nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh just to kind of like make a trifle
force of events with like sf weed week for
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower the hash week for the extracts
it's gonna be a rough weekend i know
[SPEAKER_00]: people are coming back from mj biz i know
they're gonna be destroyed i know and my
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking is that they're it's a really big
cannabis world there's a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_00]: for whom mj bizcon's not there seen i know
for cost or culture reasons or they just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to go this year and um there's
so many more backpack breeders with just
[SPEAKER_00]: like a backpack and a dream tons yeah the
sky is the limit there's when we did weed
[SPEAKER_00]: week and we put out the call man the seed
guys showed up fast it's like portable you
[SPEAKER_00]: can just do it at a table oh yeah and um
but i do think like california the west
[SPEAKER_00]: coast christmas time that's like
seasonally and geographically when we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be getting together and having like
big genetics combos that's when people
[SPEAKER_06]: want genetics is in the winter because
they're thinking about next year already
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have money from their harvest and
they have seeds from their harvest
[SPEAKER_06]: tradition yeah tradition exactly they have
seeds from their harvest they have money
[SPEAKER_06]: from the the guys who buy the seeds have
money from their harvest typically yeah or
[SPEAKER_06]: traditionally and now people you know it's
all i imagine some teams are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: divide and conquer and go to mj bizcon and
send like uh two of their guys to
[SPEAKER_00]: turbinami yeah um others are going to skip
mj bizcon or there just wasn't on their
[SPEAKER_00]: radar but i definitely want the west coast
in california in the bay area to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get together before christmas and um
see what's on offer and get new stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody who i've told is like into it
especially on the on the grower side a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of home growers are very excited yeah come
uh look at all that i'll be at the connect
[SPEAKER_06]: event thursday before doing the dinner
with my buddy he's the one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: executive chefs at the win cool uh yeah so
we're gonna put on a big dinner in vegas
[SPEAKER_06]: go for it and so yeah i'm excited i'm
excited about mj biz i got this group of
[SPEAKER_06]: friends we're doing like my pod cast is
going to be there with good pizza and a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple other podcasts we'll be
interviewing live at the amazing world ag
[SPEAKER_06]: booth and so there's going to be a lot of
people involved and i'm super excited i
[SPEAKER_06]: love these super groups where everyone
benefits and they're very innocent in a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of ways you know i think that we all
promote each other um and i love that i
[SPEAKER_06]: love that when it's it's good brands and
good people working together that can
[SPEAKER_06]: promote each other grow world works with
the kind of people and they're i feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: grow world is a lot like i am where we're
switzerland like i have my friends and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that i don't bag on anybody's
stuff and i try everybody's product i like
[SPEAKER_06]: all the different nutrients and i like
testing them and maybe some of them work
[SPEAKER_06]: better than others but i learn more about
not only the products but also about
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and ways to grow when i'm using
different products nice yeah um i uh we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw with weed week and hash week that
people want to get together they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put covid behind them they want to have a
reason to put on their pants and um mj
[SPEAKER_00]: viscon is really b2b so this will be nice
to be b2c totally and then i love the city
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's an attraction on its own it
is and it's we got sfo there and bart and
[SPEAKER_00]: then for us at weed week we saw people get
off the plane from sfo to line up to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from like cypher genetics yeah and
then just get right back on the plane it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like a you know international spot um so i
love the city i've been there for 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now great food great entertainment great
sites yeah um and just kind of a hub
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why i stay there otherwise i'd be
enjoying them like two acres it sounds and
[SPEAKER_06]: like growing you know oh yeah you know i
got my hand well so i do outdoor and i do
[SPEAKER_06]: regular seeds in my house every year
that's yeah that's what i do yeah um i've
[SPEAKER_06]: done it for a long time i i blew it out a
couple years ago and just like stunk the
[SPEAKER_06]: whole neighborhood out and i lived on a
court uh i guess i didn't live on a court
[SPEAKER_06]: but i lived on a small driveway with lots
of neighborhoods and everybody smelled it
[SPEAKER_06]: they smelled it on the back side of my
house the street all the way down i was
[SPEAKER_06]: hearing about bocce ball players like
talking about how bad it stunk on their
[SPEAKER_06]: street and i'm like oh interesting it's
actually yeah that it was the street
[SPEAKER_06]: behind me luckily that they thought it was
on but i had 80 plants in the backyard and
[SPEAKER_06]: so now i keep it to my six you know i feel
like uh i or or less i'm doing less this
[SPEAKER_06]: year less is more i got three but like i
was doing these banana crosses and i
[SPEAKER_06]: really wanted to explore what banana
skittles could be crossed into all these
[SPEAKER_06]: other things and i love skittles and i
love banana and i love candy banana i got
[SPEAKER_06]: something that's more candy banana than
banana runs but those runs candies it
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes just like i went after early girls
this year i get i have like a little grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in santa sebastopol like a six plant grow
and i get killed by the fall dew and water
[SPEAKER_00]: you might as well be like hosing down the
plants uh every morning in september and
[SPEAKER_00]: october it's brutal you just have to like
get out of the ground earlier than you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: think and i went around to the ego clash
asking for what finishes early and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were they scratched their head like god
people won't ask about early anymore go to
[SPEAKER_00]: lempire yeah dude um so i did get a loco
berry from crocket yeah um that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like this is the earliest thing at the you
know we brought to the ego clash brian's
[SPEAKER_00]: got fire and um and then i had some mendo
biscuits from higher heights nate nice um
[SPEAKER_00]: and so i ended up just making seeds this
year so i made like loco berry mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: biscuit seeds and i have like a super
early dessert to hold on to how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: select your mail um you know masonic told
me to just like follow my instincts and so
[SPEAKER_00]: such a masonic thing to say i know i like
i selected for edgar vigor and uh like the
[SPEAKER_00]: toughest one and but no the most important
thing was it wasn't the strongest or the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest it was the one that had the best
terps it was the terpiest man male nice of
[SPEAKER_06]: of the i mean that that is that's a great
answer that's a great way to do it i think
[SPEAKER_06]: going for the one that has the most turps
i mean i look for structure and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: like heads above one was one smell good
yeah if there's one that smells better
[SPEAKER_06]: that's probably the one to use you know i
mean i think that's cool i'm glad i did
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah that that's the one thing like if one
smells better or that has a better stem
[SPEAKER_06]: rub stem rums not always the end all be
all and really the best way is to make
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds with it or with all of them and then
grow the seeds out and figure out which
[SPEAKER_06]: male is the best yeah you know i think
there's and there's several ways to do
[SPEAKER_06]: that but usually it's like it's not always
the mail that you think is the best that
[SPEAKER_06]: ends up being the best is what i've
learned and sometimes using more than one
[SPEAKER_06]: male is another trick that a lot of people
do i had a really frustrating year where
[SPEAKER_00]: like my a team all flushed out and the b
team kind of dragged ass and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: the jv guys that got cut and girls that
were like just like god like looking great
[SPEAKER_00]: totally neglected um easily the most
vigorous ones and it just humbled me again
[SPEAKER_00]: i know if you have those experiences
you're like wow i thought what i was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant had a whole different like
lesson to teach me totally yeah you know
[SPEAKER_06]: anyway good times though and i i love
breeding i love people pushing the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: forward and learning how to breed i think
and make seeds is something that everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: should do uh it's just a natural
progression to being a good grower too
[SPEAKER_06]: after you've grown i think it's great to
learn more about making seeds like you
[SPEAKER_06]: learn more about yourself so and it's just
another new thing and it's easy and hard
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of people are like oh if it
doesn't come out great at least you got
[SPEAKER_06]: good seeds but like if you don't grow it
really well you might get powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_06]: because the thing is is like when you make
seeds you need to harvest it later
[SPEAKER_06]: typically than you normally would i go a
lot longer when i do genetics yeah when
[SPEAKER_06]: i'm making crosses i i might go an extra
month after the typical harvest date to
[SPEAKER_06]: get the best seeds possible especially
indoor yeah so but it's a lot of fun and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's something to be so when you pick
up a handful of seeds and drop them down
[SPEAKER_06]: the sound it makes there's something
special about that i like a cross that
[SPEAKER_00]: never existed before i don't know that
anyone's ever put the local berry on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mendo biscuits like a little crocket and a
little higher heights coming together you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like a little grass valley and mendo
meeting again um they remind i mean i have
[SPEAKER_00]: kids uh it's great to have your own little
phenos running around and the big takeaway
[SPEAKER_00]: from this year to me growing was like in
school they'll want to like you'd think
[SPEAKER_00]: like tracking is good oh this is a smart
kid kid give them more resources yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: like it doesn't it doesn't work out as
intuitive as that like there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a good reason to give them all a
shot because you don't know who the
[SPEAKER_00]: winners are the ones the early winners
will flame out and some of the like
[SPEAKER_00]: lollygaggers well they actually had the
key the whole time right and so i i backed
[SPEAKER_00]: away from like the belief in like public
school tracking just from growing weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: being like man we got to give everyone a
shot like yeah the runs too well and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's another reason if you use multiple
males don't select all of them that are
[SPEAKER_06]: similar and i like the multiple males like
using three males let's say let's say you
[SPEAKER_06]: pop 20 seeds or 50 seeds and and you're
looking for males you got your females
[SPEAKER_06]: that you've separated and then your males
that you're going to use i think picking
[SPEAKER_06]: them picking ones that represent
especially with complex poly hybrids which
[SPEAKER_06]: most of us are working with you want
something that represents maybe one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: parents something that represents another
parent something that's either in the
[SPEAKER_06]: middle or different and then you use the
pollen from all three of those because
[SPEAKER_06]: you're making f1s if you're making f2s you
would never do that because you're trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to stabilize something that that's a
specific way right same thing as you go
[SPEAKER_06]: into f3 f4 f5 you would only use one donor
and one receiver typically but in an f1
[SPEAKER_06]: type scenario where you're making seeds
sometimes more diversity is better yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll do like a mix of three pollens on
one oh yeah okay or all open i'll just
[SPEAKER_06]: leave the pollen let let the plants yeah
natural selection natural selection
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll gravitate you know i think uh
michael from gage green is big into like
[SPEAKER_06]: the natural selection the strongest
survive and all that i did that this year
[SPEAKER_00]: i like popped the whole pack and they were
all in the same container because i've
[SPEAKER_00]: grown for six years and i've grown great
weed and it was time to just fuck around
[SPEAKER_00]: again and i was like you we'll have moral
combat you guys will fight it out let me
[SPEAKER_00]: have the strongest survive that's a very
gage green thing to do for sure and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: full on like transplant i'm like brutally
just like put on a glove and be like yo
[SPEAKER_00]: come with me i was trying to like see who
would be the toughest and um it worked you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and there are some some some reason
some reasons to go down that path for sure
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah and i mean and that's great i like
data collection too so like okay so we we
[SPEAKER_06]: actually took the pollen we separated at a
different location we took that pollen put
[SPEAKER_06]: on this branch cover that branch with a
pollen bag let it sit in sprayed it down
[SPEAKER_06]: with water and then we did that on
multiple branches right and then we
[SPEAKER_06]: separated those we grew those seeds out to
test them and a lot of stuff what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing now is collecting a lot of data so i
might make a cross in a small amount we
[SPEAKER_06]: grow those out before we do any
large-scale seed production i want to know
[SPEAKER_06]: if there's intersex traits all these
important things before i do a big batch
[SPEAKER_06]: of something where i make half million
seeds of one cross last question is it
[SPEAKER_00]: ever like drastic park or should just
escapes the lab like is there ever shit
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the medians or like the i feel
like the genetics want to just like creep
[SPEAKER_06]: out and spread i hope my employee no my
employees would never take them no
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously but even that way everything is
so closed loop here right everything air
[SPEAKER_06]: filtered in air filtered out nothing no
pollen gets out in the atmosphere no
[SPEAKER_06]: pollen gets in the building hopefully you
know we have protocols for that as a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower there are volunteers in the yard
that i'm like i don't my backyard too i
[SPEAKER_06]: guarantee you whoever's living in the
house i was in there's volunteers that pop
[SPEAKER_06]: up every year there's probably going to be
for a while yeah which was again that end
[SPEAKER_00]: goal for for what the plant wanted so it's
nice to be of use yeah i mean there's
[SPEAKER_06]: ditches in uh some midwest uh midwest
states that are filled with feral weed you
[SPEAKER_06]: know that just grows wild by the wayside
comes back every year yeah when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to ban it in congress like
incredulous legislators were like you mean
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit that grows along the train tracks
that's like trying to ban bees or like ban
[SPEAKER_00]: maple trees it's like you were gonna go
get it all is that what we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_06]: here like if people want to know more
about david downs yeah where would they go
[SPEAKER_00]: i'd say download the leaflet app and uh
get notifications we'll publish the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaflet buzz column once a week or once a
month that's a roundup of west coast fire
[SPEAKER_00]: flower we do things like strain of the
year every year and budtender's choice and
[SPEAKER_00]: strains of summer and harvest we just put
out a big gummies package for the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and a big vapes package for labor day um
and we can stay really busy um finding all
[SPEAKER_00]: these cool new things like all-in-one live
rosin carts all across america live rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: gummies all across america really cool and
uh and then i'm on instagram at david
[SPEAKER_00]: downs assuming i never get taken down or
on twitter at david r downs but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just google david downs and my stuff is
out part start uh popping up and uh make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure to come out to you know sf hash week
next year turpnami in december come meet
[SPEAKER_06]: me i will be at weed week hash week
hopefully i'll make it in december we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see if i survive in the team member yeah
we'll have to send some money swap packs
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure yeah well yeah thank you so much
for coming on the show today i had a great
[SPEAKER_06]: time it's a good podcast thank you so much
looking forward to all your events thanks
[SPEAKER_06]: james loud audience dude it's been great
thank you thank you
so you
