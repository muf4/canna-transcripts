Hubsan X4 H502E
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guests are Arian
Anyoa from Greenhouse Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain Hunters, so many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing great, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an honor to be on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an honor to be in this great country
of America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we had a great time this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm so glad I finally get you on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, during COVID, we filmed together
on the James Loud show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it was you and Dust came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, really good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did that remotely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did it from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did it from your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys woke up super early in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in 2020 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 2020, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lot's changed since 2020.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years ago, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been a mentor for me since I won
my first cannabis cup in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had 150 cups by then, and you've kind
of helped guide me in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm going left or right,
and you've given me some good pointers
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years with genetics, with
branding, with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're most welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to share the knowledge and help
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and Anyoa's hospitality is bar none
the greatest hospitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best hospitality in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I go to Amsterdam, I'm taken care
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have an amazing apartment there
and amazing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always an epic adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, always nice to have you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I love the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the city, except for when it's
freezing cold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's almost always.
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't forget, you guys here in San
Francisco have great food, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have amazing food.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say San Francisco has better food
than Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have so much diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with Amsterdam, they have good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know where to go, San Francisco
just has amazing food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like here, you know, we went to a few
nice restaurants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any restaurant could be nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Amsterdam, you really have to hit a
Michelin star restaurant to make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: you're really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about
today, how you guys met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's go way back in history to the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear this because I've never
actually heard it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it would be a great starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him tell the story because it's quite
funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, well, yeah, he started already way
before before I joined Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 1985 now started with the seeds and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: 1992, the first dispensary in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was still studying at that point,
but but smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not really an alcohol guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would smoke weed, go to the coffee shops
a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went to university in San
Diego, UCSD for a year and coming from a
[SPEAKER_05]: weed background and then going to the
States in those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety five, ninety four, ninety five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't weed everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Were no dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I smoked Mexican weed, brick weed,
you know, until I could find some better
[SPEAKER_05]: ones through people that I met from
normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And funny enough, I learned more about
Greenhouse because Greenhouse was already
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit on the radar in America.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I heard about Greenhouse in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I went back to America,
to Amsterdam, where I lived all my life
[SPEAKER_05]: and I studied, I had to do at some point I
had to get a job to pay the rent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: After university.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I I got a job at the Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: I applied for a job with Arjan
coincidentally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now looking back, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just went for a cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a job interview.
[SPEAKER_05]: I joined the people that were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I started at Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, but the short story is I never
left.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I enjoyed it from the get
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I was really I really
liked cannabis much more than other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really see the benefits,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I always went with my friends,
play chess, play pool, never won fights,
[SPEAKER_05]: never won.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see other friends going to bars and
drinking and, you know, getting into
[SPEAKER_05]: fights and stuff and getting arrested.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was like, yeah, I was always
the more and more chill guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like parties and everything,
but but not really so much of the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I started at a greenhouse,
I was just, you know, went after a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: of months, first High Times Cannabis Cup,
I think ninety five or ninety six.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was such a big event,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought at that point, Holland was
so far ahead, actually looking back at
[SPEAKER_05]: that point in time, we were ahead of the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's a different story.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk more about it later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought we were going to legalize
into three years at that moment in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I thought, OK, we're going
to do this and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every year was a different thing,
you know, different projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk probably more about some stuff,
but it's always been it's been a really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's always an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys travel so much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Travel is getting an issue now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year was, I think, the worst one
because we've been traveling up and down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have Argentina opening up in
Brazil, which before was not on the radar.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've been operating in Argentina the
last 10 years to our distributor,
[SPEAKER_06]: Fran, who I used to work with in Ibiza in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he moved back to you, to Argentina.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, Arjan, it's going to open in the
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I do the distribution for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, nothing to lose now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we started that 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got everything legalized as one of the
first ones and still one of the few ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we control like 50, 60 percent of the
market with nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, our our product for for
private growers and also for commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: growers is probably one of the best and
for sure the most easiest and best priced
[SPEAKER_06]: ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a country like Brazil and Argentina,
Spain, this is a very interesting,
[SPEAKER_06]: easy product, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we moved into Argentina, now Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now and we're in Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of being only in Europe and a
little in America, we went and to the east
[SPEAKER_06]: and to the west from Europe, you know,
which creates like this crazy jet lag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now I did in four weeks,
Buenos Aires, Rio, Sao Paulo, then back to
[SPEAKER_06]: Bangkok and then back to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can imagine the time difference is
15 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just him and me were struggling
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this time, you know, in Vegas,
I think I slept two hours a day and then
[SPEAKER_06]: you're tired at seven in the evening and
you're awake at eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, it's a lot harder to come here
than it is to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you rise and if you arrive in L
.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: or San Francisco, you go nine hours back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not from Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another six hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then before you worked in Africa
a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Africa is down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then the jet lag is minimal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, most people know I'm from Africa
original.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you have if you take South Africa
or Congo from Amsterdam, it's a line
[SPEAKER_06]: straight down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same time zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is maybe one or two hour difference
in some parts of Africa, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that doesn't affect you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bangkok is quite easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's four or five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But San Francisco and L.A.
[SPEAKER_06]: is the worst, you know, especially coming
down here and then getting into meetings,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you arrive here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's technically nine in the evening and
then it's 12 again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have to work the whole day.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least there's good food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The food you have to watch because you get
lazy when you eat too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and as everybody know, I'm quite a big
foodie as you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really appreciate the food.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some great meals in San Francisco
and in Las Vegas again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like also in Sao Paulo and in Brazil
and in thing, you know, I don't have time
[SPEAKER_06]: to train.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the other problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're getting like three,
four, five kilos every four weeks,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because no time to hit the gym
or too tired to hit the gym.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, you do only half an hour
instead of a proper 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, this jet lag with our seed
company and our fertilizer company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to fine tune this system.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are we going to do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this year was out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I only limit myself to a few
fairs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we do spandibus.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do Berlin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Barcelona, Berlin, Bangkok,
Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here, because you invited us,
we did Termania this weekend, which was a
[SPEAKER_06]: great show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then last night, the ego clashed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, we are home at four o'clock in
the morning, you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the industry for you in a nutshell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody think it's easy, but it's
really, really hard work, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rock star lifestyle is a hard
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people give rock stars
enough credit to like the musician
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they go on tour and they hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys are living that similar
life right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, we're good friends with a
lot of rock stars.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably saw the picture with Dua Lipa
last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you see her travel thing, you know,
it's like hard, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then every night she's needed two
hours on stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: She really works her ass off.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the nicest people in the industry,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a rock star, you know,
you see with the DJs, but even a pilot or
[SPEAKER_06]: an airline, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't use it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: More miles than the pilot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Franco took it over, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have more miles than a pilot.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just looking at my mouse because you
just upgrade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had 650,000 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are just from a few months,
you know, because I use them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then every time you're almost about to
go back, like now we fly back tomorrow and
[SPEAKER_05]: now we're used to this schedule.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every time you're used to it and then
you go back and you start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need three, four days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And mostly we are five, six, seven days
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the moment you land, you know,
you screw it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting all over again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now the holiday is nearly there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have three more days in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then take the plug out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to go back from the
beginning and look at how it is right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: could you have imagined it how it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: But much earlier, when I started growing
in 82, 83, when I was 16, 17, 18,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was very legal in Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still totally very legal, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was at my time there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a great mushroom fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my private life, I really like
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also with my family, with my children,
with everybody, my friends around me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's one of the nicest things to
do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it opens your mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it makes you very smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives you a lot of new vision on
things, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perspective, that's the good word.
[SPEAKER_06]: My English is not so good as you guys
know, but so good perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at that time I was like, okay,
what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I going to go in marijuana or am I
going to go in mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realized that mushrooms also have
for some people negative effects because
[SPEAKER_06]: they take too much and then they can jump
down off a bridge or do something stupid.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I decided to go in marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 82, 83.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I opened my first shop in 87 with two
partners, very small shop called Tutti
[SPEAKER_06]: Frutti on the Heergracht in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had no clue about business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a long story short, after six months,
I stepped out and then they continue with
[SPEAKER_06]: it and they went broke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in 92, I started a real shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, 92 I opened Tolstra.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, the place it's still
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I started growing in 82, 10 years
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only reason I opened the shop is
that I could not get rid of my weed
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was kind of the first sativa grower
in Holland, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I was the first marijuana
coffee shop in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to see, if you're talking
about 92, 90% of the menu was hashish,
[SPEAKER_06]: mainly Moroc, a little Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Little India, you know, cherries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then 10% schwag, like some Jamaican,
some Nigerian, stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like brickweed kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad, not good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Occasionally there was something nice
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some Thai stick or some lumps bread.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were really lucky, you could get
your hands on a kilo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before that, I supplied Bulldog,
you know, Hank, a good friend of my
[SPEAKER_06]: family, and a few other coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I started growing this new stuff
because I was I come from a grower's
[SPEAKER_06]: family and my mom used to grow,
we were living in Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: She had 700 different orchids things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my mom comes from a resistant family
in the war, butter smugglers, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: against the Nazi regime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my grandmother was a butter smuggler
and they were all doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was a little on the legal side.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know the normal orchid
growth, but there's some black orchids
[SPEAKER_06]: that cost $25,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was doing that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_06]: She got very green fingers.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom is still alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's nearly 90.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I post her garden when it's in
full flower, you don't know what you see.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got the green fingers from her.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I started growing these sativas
in these hastes where I got my hands on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went back to the coffee shops and I
said, we don't know what to do with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I gave two kilos for free.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really young, you know, I was in my
twenties and I thought the owners were in
[SPEAKER_06]: charge of their shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not the dealers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then two months later I came and I
basically got my two kilos back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, it's cat piss.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dutch people don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tourists don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's buying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We only want skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you know, that was it,
you know, I couldn't do nothing with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, as a chef like you,
when you were young, this is how I grew
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, man, this is so good,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not only good for the taste,
but also how it is, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_06]: workout, how you say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the mental high, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like this couch log stone,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, why don't they like this,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started going on with it until my
wife said, listen, if you're sure that
[SPEAKER_06]: this is really good, open your own shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did that in 92.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first two years was a total,
the first year was a total drama.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brendan Kennedy, the owner of the High
Times at that time, Kennedy family,
[SPEAKER_06]: they had like a consortium with 20
magazines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he passed by in April.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never forget this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had no clue, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know America.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never heard of High Times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, listen, we're going to do
Thanksgiving, which is your November,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, no?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do a big competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get 500 or 1,000 people over
and we're all going to smoke this weed and
[SPEAKER_06]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to do an election and
blah, blah, blah, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But nobody ever heard of High Times
magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even discuss it with the other
coffee shop owners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody kind of forgot about it until
two days before Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy calls me up, we're coming
tomorrow, yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, there was 500 people in front of my
door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no clue.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was even before Yo was with me,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I called all my friends, you know,
come and help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, I had my weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a few kilos of that sativa weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had Master Kush at that time and
some were not even a name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they came and they would start
smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first two Americans, I wish I see
those guys back.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, Arjen, we've never smoked
something like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I knew I was on the right track,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And another guy came and another guy came
and it was so... And then suddenly the
[SPEAKER_06]: next three, four days, we're all sitting
in my shop, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not in the other shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: You feel the vibe, you know, going with
the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, okay, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, Hank had his hotel,
which he still has, and under there was
[SPEAKER_06]: the Buddha Club.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you remember that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buddha Disco.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Buddha Lounge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he gave the club to the guys,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: He was also competing, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just don't forget, you see five
cameras here, but there were 40.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like every television station of the world
was there because it was the first illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: drugs cup, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So CNN, BBC, Japanese television,
everybody was there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all my competitors, we were all
friends and we're still friends,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, Arjen, we have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to fire back in our face.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not good for the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the staff shitting their pants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought, well, you know,
we have nothing to lose.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are illegal already anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what can happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I don't know who was the first
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some characters there with Steve
Hager.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the first few was with
Gatwood Galebrick.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was running for governor of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is American Comes with his big
cowboy hood, you know, which we were not
[SPEAKER_06]: used to in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amsterdam is very, very multicultural.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like we're mixed from
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll make a long story short,
there were six prizes and I won five times
[SPEAKER_06]: the first prize, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the front and I picked up my
prize and I did the camera from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went like this, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you were on the cover of High
Times shortly after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then 95 and 99.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the only guy who hit the front cover
of High Times two times, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And three times more with Bud and Flower
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great honor and helped us,
helped my company a lot, our company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, from there on, we were already,
of course, working with SEAS.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then 95, we started the SEAT company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rest is history, you know,
the way you can see where we are standing
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grew organically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we never borrowed money.
[SPEAKER_06]: We never wanted to be listed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had so many offers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had so many private planes flying in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a few, few years ago, I remember
the Canadians, that two private planes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the most crazy stories that we
cannot even tell here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we said no to anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even like in Thailand now, we're very
private.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a private family, very good friends
of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do it our way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the only way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to be listed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to have investors.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just grow organically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's why our company is
quite successful, very healthy,
[SPEAKER_06]: no debt, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've transitioned all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still are in Spain, in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in the Basque country as well for
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were in the Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been all over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I like to do is I like to go to new
emerging markets where I see options.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we made a lot of Strain Hunter movies,
as you probably know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one on my radar for a very,
very long time was Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, I grew up in Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: My parents lived there nearly 40 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Congo was also on my radar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you have Africa and then you have
Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it the deep sea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a huge country.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the size of Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you heard a lot of problems about
Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those countries that the West
has totally raped.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Americans, the Chinese, the Russians,
everybody's fighting for the resources
[SPEAKER_06]: there, which gives it a really bad name.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see the diamond mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in my movie, you can see one of the
diamond mines.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our partner is the back nephew of the
former president, Joseph Kabila,
[SPEAKER_06]: which far again was the president before
and got shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he took over as a 27 year old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And eight years ago, now it's Tzideki.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had a contact through my South
African contacts.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, Arjan, we can get a letter and we
can travel free through the country and we
[SPEAKER_06]: can shoot a movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know, and as a matter of fact,
we can still see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have the growth there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still growing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're on the equator in that part,
your seas become twice as big if you grow
[SPEAKER_06]: them in full sunlight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they look really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a much, much, much, let's say
much better bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could do much more there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: After the movie we shot last day,
we're sitting in the hotel in the Vleuf
[SPEAKER_06]: and that his whole group approached us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was quite funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we have a talk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: This and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like to grow in our country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you help us?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, well, I think it's very illegal
here, no?
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, yeah, but we can get an R&D.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're connected to the president and we
want to get this industry going like
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada and United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you help us out?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, well, if you guys give me a
letter, I can grow here from agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: department or the justice minister or the
department of health, whoever,
[SPEAKER_06]: we do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we started.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was great for seeds, you know,
because we built 50 very, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: you probably saw it on Instagram,
no?
[SPEAKER_06]: We built 50 very primitive glass houses
for 18 hours because you only have the
[SPEAKER_06]: equator, no?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we work with LED lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every three meter we had a little LED
light, you know, to keep the photo period
[SPEAKER_06]: on 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had seven big valleys where we
made hundreds of kilos of seeds there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we learned a lot and that's basically
also where now the new base is coming
[SPEAKER_06]: from.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did millions of plants in those
valleys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you see now the new full gas,
King's juice, lemon and orange,
[SPEAKER_06]: many, many of the strains, they originate
from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we did the pre-breeding work
until we finalized everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly some in Spain with dust and mostly
in Thailand now.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys helped change policy in the
Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was more than just producing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what people don't know, you know,
cause you know, there's a lot of talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about greenhouse and about us and what are
we all doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we're a McDonald's and all
this bullshit, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a quite a strong core group.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from, from 95 to 2010, which is 15
years, we set up in Holland, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: retailers association.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a spokesman, by the way,
now Yoa is the spokesman in the last 15
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had huge issues in Holland and you
have to understand how this all goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite a long story, but I'll try to
explain it a little bit in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holland has had the dispensary model,
the coffee shop model.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were on the scrutiny of the United
nations, especially France, Sweden,
[SPEAKER_06]: and America.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you're violating international law.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have signed a convention of 1961 and
60, you cannot do this, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_06]: blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were under high pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in 95, we decided to start the base a
day, which I became a spokesman of and
[SPEAKER_06]: some strong other guys hang from the
bulldog.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of the big guys were in there and
we start fighting the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same time that I created the king
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody knows why I created that,
but it was to create a king.
[SPEAKER_06]: So celebrities can come from America and
start helping advocate our case.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really worked out because guys
like Woody Harrison and Bill Maher and all
[SPEAKER_06]: the big rappers, be real.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many, so many people came to our shop
because there was a king suddenly,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was a marketing strategic,
strategic idea from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still the best bobbleheads in the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have my bobbleheads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have to make them again.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went through, remind me later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you how funny a story about the
bobbleheads was because everyone was
[SPEAKER_06]: laughing about the bobbleheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have mine at the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I somehow can confirm this story
because he was witness of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He arranged his story.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so we start fighting the whole
system and make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: People like Debbie Goldsberry,
Berkley Patient Group, Steve D'Angelo,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I met last week with Harborside.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all coming to the Cannabis Cup,
you know, and we were promoting the
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, I wrote the book How to Run
a Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we were in politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke in the parliament a few times to,
like, make sure we have more leverage,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, go back to America and start
working your government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at one point, the government,
the Dutch government also saw,
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, America's getting legal now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit funny, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Americans telling us to be illegal and
themselves, of course, not on a federal
[SPEAKER_06]: level, but on the state level,
were legalizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the beginning of our politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Being politic-involved, just very
recently, Joa beat the mayor of Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_06]: after they want to kick out the tourists
again out of the center of Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_06]: because they're getting too busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, on his own, he,
like, you know, took care of that job for
[SPEAKER_06]: one year.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the job was much bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in 2004, I went back to the office and
I said to the guys, listen, if we want to
[SPEAKER_06]: survive in the future and want to have a
great brand, we should make sure that our
[SPEAKER_06]: message goes all over the world,
you know, and not only in Holland and
[SPEAKER_06]: America.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I came up with, we were called in
because I was making King of Cannabis with
[SPEAKER_06]: my greenhouse logo.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the lawyers and the mayor of Amsterdam
called me and said, listen, you are
[SPEAKER_06]: violating the laws of having a dispensary
in Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's five laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called A-H-O-G-J.
[SPEAKER_06]: A, no advertisement, no hard drugs,
no younger people, no deals under five
[SPEAKER_06]: grams, above five grams, and no
disturbance in the street.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what you have to oblige to.
[SPEAKER_06]: The A of advertisement, I was kind of
violating this set.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannot do anything on YouTube anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much greenhouse, cannabis cup,
hangar.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is really, and they liked us
because we were the spokesman said,
[SPEAKER_06]: listen, we're not going to find you now,
but stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I break my head, you know, and then at
one point I say, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said to my lawyer at that time,
I came with this one night that you saw
[SPEAKER_06]: the light, you know, okay, strain hunters,
me and Franco.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went to the office.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start filming there, rough content,
and let's see how get everybody upset.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get killed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get closed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a really bad idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when everybody said that to me,
I go the other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is going to be a really great
idea because they're already talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: The lawyers didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lawyers didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then later the mayor says,
you really got us there because she
[SPEAKER_06]: changed the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can they do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's the same face, but it's not
greenhouse, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's me, strain hunter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one we had in Malawi was a
direct success.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had 10 million hits and then National
Geographic came and then later Vice came
[SPEAKER_06]: with Shane and everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, well, you know, the whole
success about this strain hunter movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the message was to show how 200 people
around the equator are depending on
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you go to Africa, what many people
don't understand where I'm from is kids
[SPEAKER_06]: cannot go to school because they have to
guard the cattle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a poor African family would have three
fields, one corn field or they call it
[SPEAKER_06]: milly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the food for the cow and the
have maybe one cow and two goats.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a vegetable field to eat
themselves and they have a marijuana field
[SPEAKER_06]: to make a little money to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where the danger comes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if they're going to take that
away by legalization, also those families
[SPEAKER_06]: have a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to show that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, sometimes things start going
as a roller coaster, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I made Malawi and then I don't know
how many more we made, but look at where
[SPEAKER_06]: we went.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, well, Sid Vincent, you are there
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went there in 2012 because I already
knew that the volcano mountain of Sid
[SPEAKER_06]: Vincent supplies the whole Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed is not coming from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed is not coming from Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed is not coming from Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming from Sid Vincent with the
scarabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those guys are all in my movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my private life, I travel a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I met all those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, OK, I'm going to film that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within three months after we put that film
out, yeah, the president of the prime
[SPEAKER_06]: minister of Fin Zins or the president,
I don't remember, went on national
[SPEAKER_06]: television.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can Google it on BBC, say,
OK, the strain hunters were here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take their advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to lock up people anymore
for less than an ounce of a morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you're too rich, you can come
smoke on our beaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the kind of awareness we wanted
to create with those movies, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So bring something extra to the table
where we can help the community worldwide,
[SPEAKER_06]: not only in our local Humboldt area or San
Francisco area or Amsterdam area or
[SPEAKER_06]: Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, like a broader vision where
politicians are standing up, say,
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, this is reasonable on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: On a global scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did Morocco legalizing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did Colombia legalizing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did Swaziland.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did South Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed because there was your
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: We changed the constitution of Congo.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took us five years, but it went through
all the parliament.
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent more than three hundred thousand
dollars from our own money to change the
[SPEAKER_06]: constitution.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now other people have the license
there and we don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what Ayan said is like what people
don't see, because sometimes they see us
[SPEAKER_05]: in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't see the path that that is
before legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what Ayan says in Congo to change the
constitution, what it took was when we
[SPEAKER_05]: when we started there, cannabis was in the
constitution as the devil's herb,
[SPEAKER_05]: the devil's herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like you start legalization in
America where there is a cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_05]: already.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start from zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we started at minus 400.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so and then to legalize.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in 2017, for example,
our team went to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in Thailand since 2017 already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our science guy gave seminars to educate
and inform the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they said, hey, guys,
there's a chance, you know, in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to go it's going to go in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were busy with other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember what.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we said, OK, we went to prison for for
your life if you were caught with the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we said, OK, you guys go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never going to happen in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at some point, it just they made
a switch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what a lot of people don't see is they
they only see, of course, what they see on
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram and online and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't see the process before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see all the hard days.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the stuff that takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we speak to people, see what what is
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: They see Thailand, they see Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we're also talking with other
countries around because because Thailand
[SPEAKER_05]: is the first one in Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can understand that the countries
around are watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking, observing what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they send delegations to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: We speak with the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also in Thailand is they started the
legalization completely basically opposite
[SPEAKER_05]: as Canada and Germany over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They started with, you know, in Canada
with a big book of regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many rules and made the product very
expensive in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said it's legal from now on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you say, OK, what's the legalization?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the legal framework?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no legal framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's legal now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so they started with zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like black or white.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're writing the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the most asked question to us is how is
it going in Thailand?
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear it's going to go backward.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not backward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the dance.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's the dance how we're going
to regulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started with zero and now we're
writing the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, now we're doing making the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes up, it goes down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't make it easy because,
you know, again, on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: everything's always nice parties and you
know, well, Instagram is part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like people are so excited about
the way stuff looks that it's gone away
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it taste?
Also?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you look at Thailand,
it's a good example he gives like Thailand
[SPEAKER_06]: League last two years ago in June 2022.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2018, we got the phone call.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you come and advise that university?
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be some politicians and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Haiko, who's the guy who is behind all
these papers and everything, our partner,
[SPEAKER_06]: I said to him, don't go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Haiko is from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a house in Koh Samui.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he know Thailand really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, Arjen, let me go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, listen, we're going to spend
$50,000 on a pitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to take two professors,
a doctor follow up before airplane
[SPEAKER_06]: tickets, hotels.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never, ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be legal in Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the end, you convinced me to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, okay, you go, you spend half the
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take one guy and one doctor and you
go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go do your thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he went, he said it was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, what's the only advice you give
them?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, don't make the mistakes we made in
Holland, in Canada, in the United States,
[SPEAKER_06]: with all your bloody regulations,
you know, over regulation, over taxation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can talk about that a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I told them one thing, don't make that
mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2022, they called me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see, by the way, in my Thai movie
that we launched in February, the Deputy
[SPEAKER_06]: Prime Minister in the movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine a Deputy Prime Minister or
Prime Minister of any Western country in a
[SPEAKER_06]: pod movie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_06]: There they came because I promised them 80
million tourists by 2030 and they're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went already this year to 35 million
and next year we go 40 million,
[SPEAKER_06]: then we go 50 million.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we're all on board in Thailand,
we're going to try to get the F1 now in
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand, in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to legalize gambling maybe,
and there's more things going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in 2022, they called us and they said,
we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to legalize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Recreational and medicinal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to just let it go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of medicinal and we'll see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where we're standing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is one of the things that we as a
team bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's two other Asian countries
we're speaking right now, we just had the
[SPEAKER_06]: two sons of one president of an Asian
country flying into Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Secret Service comes, they put fucking
tape on the cameras and then we speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how it really goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Laos just legalized medicinal cannabis
in the neighboring country of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are really proud of that because
Japan next year, 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're talking to the main guys there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are advising.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a very good friend of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few Japanese billionaires are behind
that push.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo University and it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to go slow in Japan because
it's quite a conservative country.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every step helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like now in Germany also, it's limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's with a lot of restrictions,
but it's a big step because it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: biggest country in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what about the Middle East?
[SPEAKER_06]: If technically, I'm quite in shock when I
land in San Francisco and LA and New York
[SPEAKER_06]: and I see the airports.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same a little bit in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you go to Abu Dhabi or Dubai or
Singapore or Hong Kong, you come in a new
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're way ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: And 9 January this year, UAE, so Dubai and
Abu Dhabi, the punishment for smoking went
[SPEAKER_06]: from 30 years to three months.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first big step.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge step.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge step.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nobody realizes this, but HICO has
been working very extensive with the
[SPEAKER_06]: government there for the last three years,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's difficult because they have all kinds
of issues there in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Middle East, like the Emirates is
like, every religious group, every,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not letting you say the names,
every other group, let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all say, okay, this stays out of the
conflict zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where our wives and our kids go to
school.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where we have the holidays and
this is where we kind of try to figure out
[SPEAKER_06]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the place where we then also
can talk and see, okay, how far can we go?
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to give you an example,
there's a few big party areas from Ibiza
[SPEAKER_06]: that are now going to open in Dubai.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for example, Ushuaia.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's other groups that I know
really well that are not going,
[SPEAKER_06]: that are also invited by the bosses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the conversation goes like,
why are you turning down so much money
[SPEAKER_06]: doing the party here in Dubai or in Abu
Dhabi?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my people can't use drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, well, and then the sons of the
bosses say, okay, well, we'll be working
[SPEAKER_06]: on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where we are standing now in
the real world, like, okay, who's making
[SPEAKER_06]: the next move?
[SPEAKER_06]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very recently, you can have six plants
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came from a fair, there was 30,000
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I did 10,000 autographs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Brazil, Argentina, Germany,
Thailand, you see the movement going,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we are involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: The momentum, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you see our countries like,
I see your bloody president, Joe Biden,
[SPEAKER_06]: partying in two bloody turkeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's only president for another month.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he pardoned his son.
[SPEAKER_06]: He did.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two turkeys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what about those 20,000 innocent
people sitting for cannabis in jail?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand, 2022 released on the same day,
7,000 prisoners that were convicted for
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the same day, 7,000 people out of
prison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not a single problem with one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And gave out how many clones?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one million, no?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and one million clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave out one million clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a more symbolic thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, it's a pretty cool symbolic
gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: The act of giving is very symbolic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's many presidents in
the world that would do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not happening here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not happening in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Trump will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what's going to happen in
the next four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if Trump gives them out,
at least their biggest, the best,
[SPEAKER_05]: most awesome clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you'll ever, ever see.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best clones in the world.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just never know what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are scared and a
lot of people are excited about what could
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've been going in the wrong
trajectory for the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more than the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's see now your American
government.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I look around Trump now, Trump is the
only one who doesn't drink and doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the rest does.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's Joe Rogan, or it's Alan Musk,
or whoever it is, they're all smokers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see how this will influence him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what kind of decisions would be made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, it can't go any worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it can't go any worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the potential is really good
for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to change one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing constant is change
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we need change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the economy is in a bad place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's silly that we don't have federal
legalization for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a federal level, yet we have more
than half of the United States in support
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more than half of the United
States that's medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that we need to look at
ourselves in the mirror a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the younger generation is
getting older now and they are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be the big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the next 10 years, it's definitely
going to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, our problem is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have five enemies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have pharma as an enemy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have tobacco as an enemy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have alcohol as an enemy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have the religious people as an
enemy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I probably forgot one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then our governments now, if you look at
Japan or Asia, you look at Europe and you
[SPEAKER_06]: look at America.
[SPEAKER_06]: 4% obesity in Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: 25% in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: 60% in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our politicians are killing us because
they are responsible for this huge problem
[SPEAKER_06]: in America with fentanyl and with wrong
food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the food you guys are eating is
illegal in Europe or in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of these additives and all that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you just take it from there,
if the politicians are already willing to
[SPEAKER_06]: kill their own people, they don't give a
shit about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here is a huge problem for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: If our politicians are not taking
responsibility to ban certain foods and
[SPEAKER_06]: certain chemicals that are used,
why should they worry about marijuana?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the biggest problem, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are killing our own population and
we don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I mean, you guys can both agree
with me that cannabis makes the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at it any other way,
alcohol and tobacco are way worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how you look at it, you look at
the statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically, it's a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more deaths from alcohol and
tobacco across the board, yet cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: still illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But cannabis will always have that stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it can change really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that, for example... I don't think
it had the stigma 200 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't think 100 years from now it's
going to have the same stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but here is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's why I read from Madness.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but here it's much more accepted and
it's changed also with the kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization, you know, even if it's on
the state level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in Thailand, for example, you see it
as well like two years ago or four years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago, of course, it's not... I mean,
you can't even roll up a joint in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you go to a Michelin star rooftop
restaurant, for example, you say,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, can we smoke here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to the smoke area, you roll a joint
and other people will ask you,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're interested in it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Holland, you cannot even imagine that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they all want it on the streets,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't even smoke on the streets
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't smoke in the streets,
no, but cannabis there is pushed... Like
[SPEAKER_05]: last week I was giving an interview on
television because there was an eight page
[SPEAKER_05]: letter from the mayor about the center of
the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one sentence on coffee shops
and the media pick it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they talk about coffee shops and said,
we have such big problems in this
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhood, you know, robberies,
gang wars, drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you pick out this one sentence,
there's much bigger problems, but they
[SPEAKER_05]: keep always going back to the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to blame it on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes even in Thailand, and we speak
with the minister, I go on television in
[SPEAKER_05]: Thailand, speak about the policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fly back to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to the council to speak about not
smoking a joint in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: The contrast is sometimes so big,
it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I mean, I'm born and raised in
Amsterdam and I'm proud of the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes nowadays I'm even a little
bit embarrassed of this situation,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when people say, oh,
you can't smoke in Amsterdam anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just on the street in certain
areas, but they're pushing it in a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've cut down on the coffee shops
too, because there was a lot of coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went from 400 to 165.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to cut even more back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, the whole thing with tourists
now, okay, all the tourists are coming for
[SPEAKER_06]: the coffee shop, which is totally
bullshit, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the center, they say, oh,
it's so big.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the red light area, there's 12
coffee shops left.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even the local people that are against
us, they say, yeah, the Warmestraat,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a famous street, they used to
have 20, there's zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they still think there are 20 there
and they live around the corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the mayor and the mayor is
sitting there in council.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're going to ban the tourists
from the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the most political parties that
are smart enough to live there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're going to get a lot of
street dealers now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Heroin and crack is back at the Central
Station in Amsterdam for the first time in
[SPEAKER_06]: bloody 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's no cops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not only we don't have housing,
we don't have nurses, we don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Schools in Amsterdam are going to four
days because we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_05]: teachers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you know what Ayan says?
[SPEAKER_05]: This information that the council gets,
they don't get it from anywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: but from us, us as a community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about us in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even the people watching, if you want
to help legalization, if you want to help
[SPEAKER_05]: normalization, legalizing cannabis,
you have to speak with your local
[SPEAKER_05]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a dance always,
there's new people coming in and out.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's new people coming in the
council, I go there because literally they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know the difference between hash and
wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't know the difference,
how can you make a policy about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot because you don't know what you
base your opinion on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're influenced by the people
around you that like it or don't like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't underestimate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if people are in councils or like
municipalities where it's still a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit, you know, gray area or whatever,
and you want to change, go out and talk
[SPEAKER_05]: with the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm not in Amsterdam and there's
something in the media, I call around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wants to go on television.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, guys, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell your story because people need to
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also tell people outside of the
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people who produce glass houses and put
them in Canada and in America,
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch companies that are super successful
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please help me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say this message.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's helpful, you know, but people
need to get the message across.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we do always podcasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do seminars.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they invite us in Canada for a seminar,
we go, you know, a Ted talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do everything to always keep talking
and informing, educating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's much more diplomatic than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of the time I let him do it
because I hate them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't handle them because I tell them
straight in the face.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your government is responsible for losing
a hundred billion of economic prosperity.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the last five years, in the coming five
years, you killed the glass house
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You killed the light industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gavita was a Dutch company.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sold it for $240 million to
Hawthorne, friends of mine, all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you selling such a viable,
good companies from Holland?
[SPEAKER_06]: Newton's companies, all sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: They killed it in Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the best things, biggest things is
going to be bigger than porno and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoking marijuana, you know, it's bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: You kill it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you killing the baby?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just telling that, you know,
and it's, it's, it's amazing because they
[SPEAKER_06]: have no clue only because of their own
political agenda.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every politician is sitting there
because his own private agenda.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a politician sitting there
like a Gandhi or a Nelson Mandela.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had that's therefore really for
everybody in the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's always like it's a Donald
Trump or it's a Joe Biden with an agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But is Joe Biden there for us?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Donald Trump there for us?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, is the Dutch prime minister
there for us?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tough to be a politician.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that not a lot of people
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, not, I have no interest in
politics, but, uh, so as far as you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are now in Thailand and you are very
vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the most vertically
integrated companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go from not only seed to sale,
but you grow your own that you sell at
[SPEAKER_00]: your own dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus you're also moving into GMP
international export.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is that going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, look, we're in Holland and we
also have been in Holland and there we are
[SPEAKER_06]: very, very limited, you know, since 2002,
I'm not able to go to one grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm being caught in a grow room and
take away all the license.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can never control our menu.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some, sometimes people bitch about our
menu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some stuff is not the best because yeah,
but we are depending on a very illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get caught with a little grow room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go straight four years to prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our dream was to be vertically
integrated somewhere where we can really
[SPEAKER_06]: show all our skills.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we make great seeds, but yeah,
if you cannot show the flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's really bad, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Thailand, we have the option.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we grow a poly wheat or glass house
wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it premium glass house.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow indoor wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow even GMP wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from all those products, we can make
dry sift, we can make a Rosen,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically from one variety,
you have five different things,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now in, in our six dispensaries that
we have five in Bangkok and one in Costa
[SPEAKER_06]: Moine, people can come there and they can
have the whole experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to have Rosen, you want to have
this, you want to have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was part of our dream, you know,
to have that virtually integrated to the
[SPEAKER_06]: max.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are in Northeast Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can probably compare the climate a
little bit to North Cal, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the season, we get our humidity in
the glass houses down to 35%, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the night and the day
temperature is great, especially between
[SPEAKER_06]: August and March.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can make there a great product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next step to us, which was always
our step is to make sure that your mom and
[SPEAKER_06]: my mom can have it in a pharmacy in a
country where you cannot have it
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational where you have to go on the
street like England.
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany, a little bit Australia.
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably somewhere next year we will
have our product on the shelves there for
[SPEAKER_06]: a very reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you can obtain our great lemon
orange or full gas or super lemonade or
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuri cake or King's Cush.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's the vertically integrated
green dream, but then 3.0 because now it's
[SPEAKER_06]: also GMP and we can make sure it's on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are ourselves GMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like that somebody else has to do
the back door or the front door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where it's GMP packed and whatever,
you know, we do that in our own house.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the next and actually final
step of my dream to be like in different
[SPEAKER_06]: countries, you know, like a normal
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just it's pharma technically,
but it's still weeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a great product and we can make sure
that your grandmother, my grandmother,
[SPEAKER_06]: whoever can obtain that product in a safe
way for a very reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's beautiful because it's
somewhere between pharma and ag,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I feel like it's not an absolute
pharma product, but it's not an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: ag product either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, look, technically it's totally ag
because we grow ag, you know, it's a glass
[SPEAKER_06]: house where it's indoor, you know,
it's only the GMP part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically post-harvest, you know,
the packaging, you know, it's just,
[SPEAKER_06]: just to read, just to understand,
you know, Heiko and I do the recreational
[SPEAKER_06]: part.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to do that part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the SOPs is one meter 40 paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paperwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the CGMP paperwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: SOPs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: EUGMP is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are German EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the highest standard in the
world because you have American GMP,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have Dutch GMP, you have Israeli GMP,
you have Thai GMP, but the German one is
[SPEAKER_06]: the one most recognized.
[SPEAKER_06]: So also the audit happens from Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the group flies in and audits our
factory.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, and then from there we can,
so we are now 18 months in the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just started there in 2022.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a huge pheno hunt, probably the
biggest ever with 147,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can speak a little bit about that
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from there on, I think mid of next
year, we will be in the shelves in
[SPEAKER_06]: Australia and in UK or Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's a dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really, I still cannot believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't speak too much about it,
you know, because we want to see it
[SPEAKER_06]: happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't like to think,
talk about things that didn't happen yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, everybody sees us on the radar
and yeah, we can't hide it anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've actually 20 to 23, we opened the
first club June 23.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first year me and us were like,
with our caps, you know, on the airport,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, people seeing us, what are you
guys doing here?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because we want to have this
little advantage because we are refitting
[SPEAKER_06]: the factory that we took over in the North
and adding the GMP part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we are, you know, now we are out in
the opening and people are seeing it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, so we came out with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to go through some of the
phenohunt stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through 560 different plants or
we went through a part of 560 different
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a sense for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time smoking this,
this frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our drips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one I picked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What cross is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's several different
expressions within the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of all the seeds we popped,
there's, I wouldn't say there's super
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, but there is with,
with, uh, there's maybe four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes that really stand
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of them for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to do a little bit more
selection on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there can be more selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this one's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we picked, I feel like that
was the one that had the best nose and the
[SPEAKER_00]: best structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many seeds you had out of this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we popped, uh, 40 of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 40 different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five phenos in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the one pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, but see within that,
that there's a couple of different ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that like that's the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's the nose and then there's
the structure and then finding them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cross those two again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud structure is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not completely closed as far as the
bracts or completely open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's got good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the flavor is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really liking the flush that we use on
this too.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many, what do you flush 10 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: We flush eight days in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven or eight days and eight was perfect
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tough with the phenohunt because
you have stuff that finishes a different
[SPEAKER_00]: times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have stuff that pull a day 53,
and then we have stuff by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, all the plants all as yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hand water our entire flush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had, we had water our entire growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like irrigation, except for the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we basically want to run it
through each plant and we do, we just do
[SPEAKER_00]: once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we do pulse feeding normally with
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we multiple times a day,
we, we feed like 16 times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you feed 16 times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like every 50 minutes, 40 minutes
or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every 50 minutes we're feeding on
this, on this one anyway, we've
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we do trials here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're a research and development
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll try different things to get
optimal results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we got pretty good results
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the flush we hand water and
we make sure to get it flushed through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's too thick to run through the
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there's so much molasses in it
that you could never get that through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through your drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, not through the ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I expected a little bit more of the flavor
from the smell I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be even coming down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite as terpy as the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why we're phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking for those winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Thailand, you guys are doing huge
phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go through that many plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you can't smoke every single one
of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have 32 flowering glass houses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone fits 1,550 plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we try to limit it to one or two
varieties.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we put out kind of 1,500 plants or
1,500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that makes it already a little bit
easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from there on, we pull out the 10 best,
grow them another time and then also grow
[SPEAKER_06]: them indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we keep five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So because we saw in the past that
sometimes in the, let's say third or
[SPEAKER_06]: fourth crop, some Hermi pops up suddenly.
[SPEAKER_06]: That can happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sexual stability and whatever
that herm, the intersex traits stabilize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's a different time of the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's more hot in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what, but something happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't happen a lot, but it happens
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also for sharing clones, we give number
three or number four away, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then number one or two, we keep in our
library.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then number one, we make the weed for
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of how we work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also with the number one or two
or three, we depend on whatever we kept it
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do the breeding, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we cross them two or we sell one as
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends a lot on many things,
but that's kind of how we work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would try to put a minimum of 200 seeds
out, but preferable 1,000, 1,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's how well I know the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's stuff where I know I'm looking
for something specific that I know I can
[SPEAKER_00]: find it in 50 or 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I'm working in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm limited with the amount of space that
I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my model is a little bit different and
I might pop 10 of something and not find
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's worth revisiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes I'll just pop 10 to see if
it's even worth exploring more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of these crosses that we're
making, it's like they have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive traits and you're looking for
the recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes even within the progeny,
you don't get any expression of really
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but you understand America much better
than me, but that's also a little bit the
[SPEAKER_06]: bad luck you guys have that you're limited
to space, no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see that with all the breeders and
most of the grows are spreadsheet grows
[SPEAKER_06]: here in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to turn over whatever,
60 grams of feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise the investors get really angry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have any options.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know also in ag, technically find
something near like salad and corn.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do 10,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't have near the diversity
that we have in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but that even says we should even put
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that makes it more difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: To find something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so tough to find something
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were going through a lot of stuff
where we kept saying, oh man, this reminds
[SPEAKER_00]: me of this or this reminds me of this
stuff that's 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the purple oracle crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even with the RS 11 crosses,
it has this interesting structure that
[SPEAKER_00]: reminds me of the Calio or some of these
old orange varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was nice to see at Turpnami in the
weekend also that a lot of the hazes are
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen hazes in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five guys came to me with three of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, super silver has one with
Hawaiian snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where did we grow this from?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know Hawaiian snow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know your thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've progressed in a lot of ways in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a lot of the guys were coming
from Humboldt and Mendocino from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hills, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like those guys are coming down with
these equatorial and sativa crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday on the Eagle Clash, there were a
lot of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even more, I'm sure, because it's local.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is that everything has to be
six, seven weeks where really good weed is
[SPEAKER_06]: 10, 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, those kinds of varieties,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many amazing, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave from Budge Lair that had the pearls
that was at Turpnami.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on the podcast recently, but he only
does longer flowering varieties and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, more so than
anything he's breeding for the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect of those is so different
than the stuff that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven weeks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw the Dr. Greenspoon-like strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a different phenome of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is even longer.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's like one of the few guys
that wants to grow that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of people have the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's people are on the scrutiny of Wall
Street guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have this big facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 17 owners and they demand six,
seven, 70 grams in seven weeks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six crops, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is the main problem,
which kills the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think anyway, listed companies
kill the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't see any really good
things coming out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at Canada, 2018 to 2024,
and as you know, we were partners with
[SPEAKER_06]: Canopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how many money got blown up?
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Six years, Canada, how many money went
into stock market?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many hundreds of millions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Big money.
[SPEAKER_06]: $770 billion Canadian dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which let's say 500 US.
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 billion US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly.
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 billion just evaporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people losing two, 300 million per
quarter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: How in the hell is this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they were just talking about Jay-Z
and his brand, how it lost a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in our shop last year and I told
him, see, it's not the way to do things,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a guy like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's no passion for cannabis
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not into craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't understand the craft model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I, we both have
experience in as far as you had Heineken,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Laganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to work with Laganese and they
created a craft product from the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: with the intention to scale and to the
scale to the point where they sold it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Heineken for a billion dollars,
half a billion originally, and then 3
[SPEAKER_00]: years later.
880 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 880 million.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were involved a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our friend did the deal and then it came
in the newspapers in Holland and then
[SPEAKER_06]: Heineken CEO said, oh, we didn't know it
was CBD brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You pay $1 billion, you don't know your
shit, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should resign immediately then,
no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that was such a joke, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, I think Laganese is a
great brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like that beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of my favorite IPAs to drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great people, great beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did a fucking great job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Heineken, it was just a bunch of
idiots because, and that is the corporate
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that is against us because let me,
you want to hear a really funny thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say it was Heineken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's say it was a very big Dutch beer
brewer.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the biggest, there's a few of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly in 98, 99, one of the reasons
we had to start the Cannabis Retail
[SPEAKER_06]: Association in parliament, questions were
asked about the mix of alcohol and
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in our shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We remember we had alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had five dispensaries in Amsterdam
with alcohol, 20%.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was only 40 in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had 20% of the license in the
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly in parliament, Christian
parties were popping up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we want to discuss this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Poly drug use.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: Poly drug use, so multiple drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a really bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it crossfading, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: They started in 2000 and we lost
everything in 2007.
[SPEAKER_06]: It turned out really great for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go into details because
we were making much more money when the
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol was out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were panicking and then it was much
better in the end of the day for us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And later in 2016 or 17, I was on a party
and one of the main guys from this brewery
[SPEAKER_06]: came to me and said, Arjan, we figured out
that in a dispensary, there's 70% less
[SPEAKER_06]: consuming of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the only way to drink healthy way
alcohol is to also smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you're with your friends,
you drink eight or 10 beers and you have a
[SPEAKER_06]: great night.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you smoke one joint, you're only going
to drink three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is the best combination in the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the opposite what the Christian
parties made us do in Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ben, a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's only good if I smoke before I
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I've been drinking and then you smoke,
it's all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you do it first,
it's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the alcohol use go less than marijuana
use increased over alcohol use,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, in America?
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: In America so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I remember already when I was with
Erich on the party six, seven years ago
[SPEAKER_06]: that I walked into parties, there was no
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one guy drinking a bottle of red
wine and everybody was smoking and there
[SPEAKER_06]: was no Bell Prize winner there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a professor from university.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's funny now that the political
party, who's a Christian party,
[SPEAKER_06]: so they have another agenda and raising
this in parliament, making it happen that
[SPEAKER_06]: we lose all our license.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the end of the day,
it's a really bad decision they made
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's much healthier to drink and
smoke at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our double lemon cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Runtz S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good yielder and it has
really high turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that combination that has the
structure, it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely passes on the structure
with the turps to a lot of the things we
[SPEAKER_00]: breed it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I can ask you, what are you looking
for?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking for more turps or a higher
THC?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you look for also commercially?
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think commercial viability is
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I went back to
the drawing board after 420 when my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: died.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to only breed for effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: He still is totally right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a craft brand like we are and
you are, of course, everything is high
[SPEAKER_06]: THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: People want 28, 32.
[SPEAKER_06]: But your 33 here in America is not a real
33.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maximum is our 25.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our 23 sativas get you more high than
the 32 American couchlock one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of the flavonols of the turpentine
profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a reason to explain that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the sativas that are early 20s are by
far higher than the 30s in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect is much stronger.
[SPEAKER_06]: The longer the flowering, the longer the
effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also find it much more pleasant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's less paranoia on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people in the States,
because they haven't experienced sativas
[SPEAKER_00]: or really good hazes, they think of the
sativas as the ones that make your heart
[SPEAKER_00]: beat out of your chest, that give you
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fentanyl, no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the hazes, you get some of the
strong, super strong hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not all like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also have that with strong indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with strong indica, they have this
narcotic effect where you just feel super
[SPEAKER_00]: tired.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see more people getting more
slightly to the paranoia side if you smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: too much of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard that much more than with the
sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then there's the feel-good weed,
which is what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how much you smoke, you just
feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the guy that passed away, his name was
Dave Mesford.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a podcast the week before he
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gifted me a seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he really was breeding for effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his priority was how does it make you
feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he worked with some Nigerian hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really wild stuff that we're feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino hunting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was his percentage of THC
according to him?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he was more into the mild THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 22?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 15 to 20 maybe even.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That range.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the best range for a
perfect workout and a terp in profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the higher you get, the more terps
get more complicated to have this really
[SPEAKER_06]: nice body.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flavor gets not better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher the cannabinoids get,
there's only so much room on the plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at it like that,
then the terpenes a lot of times are less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare that you have something
that tests in the 30s, like truly tests in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 30s, that has super high terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell me now, this perception here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We both chefs in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love to cook together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did that many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it possible that everybody is
smoking this hydro wheat, even the cocoa
[SPEAKER_06]: wheat, which we're smoking now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I only grow organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to grow on soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly on soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we go to a restaurant and we would get
organic food, we would never come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tomatoes taste like water.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cucumber doesn't taste nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: The salad is not good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in North California, you have great
food.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you go to dispensary and all
those big guys, they'll all grow in rock,
[SPEAKER_06]: coal, ore, and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is everybody smoking that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's because of the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have gone away for the bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't give a shit then about the
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's something that we have
to reintroduce to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's a lot of new
smokers and so they don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're educated on cannabis by
Instagram and social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's so important that your stuff
looks good on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I love about the pre-rolls
and the hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what we have right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you don't have to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to be able to have a product
where people didn't care what it looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could give them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they trusted my brand so much that
they bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even care what the flower looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
it's all about effect and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But social media has gone in this
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good side to social media,
a bad side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely with the cannabis,
it's about how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to look a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's things like Oreos that
have no turps whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nothing I would ever want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to your point about the Hydro,
I feel like if you're going in rock wool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow okay stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that are doing it the best,
they grow okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly what you say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sometimes the genetics, they work
okay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say cocoa is the happy medium
because you get the yield and the
[SPEAKER_06]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's say we agree on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like smoking soil is better on my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's just... Of course it's better
on your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a non-chemical if you use organics.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put a mineral through soil,
then you get away with the real liquid
[SPEAKER_06]: chemicals that American fertilizer
companies throw on the fucking Hydro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all so green, we're all
marijuana, we're all cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're all smoking this.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we won't know for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can argue about yeah, okay,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is again spreadsheets,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the same people that made America
and Europe obese.
[SPEAKER_06]: And killing us with the wrong nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those kids are going with the
baggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bag appeal is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bag appeal in Hydro is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're smoking a chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turping their weed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the turp pouches next to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were real cannabis turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are the fake turps where they
have non-cannabis turps and they're adding
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like McDonald's, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nothing I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, unfortunately, there's something
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the testing in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're selling a product that's 35% but
they're spraying THCA on it and that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they send it to the testing
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember in the beginning,
you guys sat here and it was a bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: hype, but you had the PGR nugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that were rock hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at some point everybody,
they're away from PGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: PGRs are now illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean they don't use it,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you still have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people still want those really tight
nugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even after they know it's illegal and it's
bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think PGRs help people get bigger
yields and that's why they want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nothing I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only PGRs that are a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else is in those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, this coughing disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: This really bad coughing and puking.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's puking what everybody has.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the name.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of it right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the top of my head, but it's the
one with the cannabis that basically makes
[SPEAKER_00]: you sick and makes you want to throw up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and my son-in-law and my son have it by
huge coincidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did extensive tests the last three
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my son-in-law had a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's rushed into hospital a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there we find the medicine that stops
the puking in half an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the puke doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have the dry heaves or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you hear this really funny puke where
you know when people have nothing in them
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore, this high tone puke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had to save him last year in
Rolling Loud in the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to rush him to the hospital because we
didn't have the medicine with us and we
[SPEAKER_06]: were smoking all day.
[SPEAKER_06]: He got the attack.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he already figured out when he smokes
Dutch grown wheat, he doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when he smokes Kali wheat with hydro,
he gets it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My son now, exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I catch him one night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Puking, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's 18.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I heard a sound and I say,
hey, you have the same as Zigo,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to the hospital, got the
medicine, gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was smoking Kali wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what's going on there,
but there is, so we have the cure for this
[SPEAKER_06]: because I saw some people talking in the
press.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite new, this, this, this puking
disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know the cure and I think I also
think it has, it's related to Kali wheat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think to the salts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It must be something in the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a nutrient company too with your
powder feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you are the innovator of powder
feeding to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they had it in big ag before you
guys had it, but you really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroduced it to the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a lot of companies have followed
suit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we started it 10 years ago and it's
not our core business, but I felt that all
[SPEAKER_06]: the nutrients we're doing these big liquid
stuff was going in the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I knew it was possible, you know,
but I was good friends with Larry always
[SPEAKER_06]: in the general, I had a policy,
not possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't have a one component, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we kept working and working and working
until we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the organic one we have is the
best one in the world with soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and then we have, of course also the
mineral line, but we made it for a very
[SPEAKER_06]: reasonable price and very easy access.
[SPEAKER_06]: People love it, you know, because she
makes it to the soul and you walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have a buffer in there and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and with, of course with the salts,
with the minerals you add, if your water
[SPEAKER_06]: is not good, you add some calcium,
you know, and with a booster and stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: like that, but it's still one component,
you know, and it's very easy to use,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's a very fair product, you know,
everybody who starts it doesn't go away
[SPEAKER_06]: from it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on low carbon footprint,
I think that's the big takeaway for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of places like the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's super, super important to not
transport extra water to a place like the
[SPEAKER_06]: Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you remember Jamie Oliver going to
the schools in England, showing the kids,
[SPEAKER_06]: you remember that thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember when the kid with McNuggets,
how he did that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took the whole bloody chicken,
put it in a fucking blender and all that
[SPEAKER_06]: shit and kids were freaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what you're eating.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all stopped.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if you can like go to a big grow
and show them like real soil and the
[SPEAKER_06]: grandmother is there, how she make a real
pasta with a good brand with real tomatoes
[SPEAKER_06]: from outside, you know, tastes so much
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you show them the indoor with the
hydro, with all these chemicals and that
[SPEAKER_06]: goes through your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and for me, I want to smoke this
really nice in, but if you look now,
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I could do a large scale living
soil because I see all my little friends
[SPEAKER_06]: with their closet grows doing the living
soil farmers out there for fucking taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all the stuff we've had in the
last three days, four days.
[SPEAKER_06]: All living soil, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking worms and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you want to eat and that's
what you want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would already be scared to smoke every
day all this hydro, you know, because I
[SPEAKER_06]: would think I'm going to get sick at one
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so my next question for you would be
from hydro to indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see the future of
cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you believe in the
greenhouse model being Dutch and also
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your thing in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see the hybrid model as being the
future for the industry, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it depends a lot on what country we
are for the climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, if you're going to
need, if you're in North Canada and you
[SPEAKER_06]: have to heat up that glass house,
you're going to lose a lot of electricity
[SPEAKER_06]: costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also depends on your electricity bill
in which country you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in North Europe, it's 25 cents and in
Argentina, it's five cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So already debt, you know, what are you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for both is something,
well, for all say something to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think outdoor wheat is great for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can do that, why should you not
grow outdoor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's going to see the flower and you
have a great turpentine profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially here in North Cal where you
probably have the best climate in the
[SPEAKER_06]: world, you know, like where I'm in North
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you have the glass house,
which could be hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my glass houses have no light because
I'm on the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't even, I don't need light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any assistive lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I only have three big exhaust fans blowing
in and three big exhaust fan blowing out
[SPEAKER_06]: and one in the middle to help out,
you know, and I have great sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't need to dehumidify or
humidify.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because between October and March,
I'll be under 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm fine, you know, and then you have,
of course the indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you could be in very complicated
areas like in North Canada or in Patagonia
[SPEAKER_06]: and the south of the planet or wherever,
and you need a lot of electricity,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's nowhere the way, you know,
some areas you can't grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then you, of course you have the
GMP story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like where it gets technically difficult
is glass house, of course, is less stable
[SPEAKER_06]: than indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us is to fine tune that we are the
first in the world to go through that
[SPEAKER_06]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, can we do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, because every crop you can
imagine is a little bit different because
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes we have seven weeks of sun,
but sometimes we have five and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the light intensity changes
throughout the year and there's clouds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this means your profile changes a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have a leverage of 20% in a GMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if it's 20, it can be 18,
but you can't go to 17 because then the
[SPEAKER_06]: batch is disregarded, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also time of the year,
you have like in Thailand, you have a few
[SPEAKER_06]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in Europe, we have four seasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have four seasons here too,
I assume.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have four seasons in a glass
house and you have supplemental lights,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the third profile will be different
because of the sunlight, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how far can you play with that and how
far?
[SPEAKER_00]: With spectrum tuning now, I mean,
I think there's new possibilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, it's still, you're still going
to get a different chemical profile
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so many micro variables
that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but your best bet is with a
Venlo or with these glass greenhouses.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it's also our duty as a community
to make sure that we have certain kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: leverage in a GMP where we all accept
that, you know, the turpents this time of
[SPEAKER_06]: the year, a little bit less than the other
time of year, but it's still qualifies as
[SPEAKER_06]: a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only time this comes into a,
you know, it can be a major issue is with
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotyping when you're looking for that
exact chemical profile for like drug
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery or for medicine, but they can do
a lot of stuff with extraction as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Israel has gone through a lot
of, you know, of that over the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 15 years, Deti Miri, I talked to him
a couple of times and trying to get him on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, but you know, the drug
discovery and stuff they're doing over
[SPEAKER_00]: there and trying to keep the chemical
profile the same in greenhouse houses or
[SPEAKER_00]: even just in the same environment is the
plant can change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your thoughts on Israel as far
as let's talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was invited by a few different
factories.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me personally, and for our
company, long story short, we will never
[SPEAKER_06]: go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we do not agree on their policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's too harsh for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, you know, like it's just a
very complicated country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very complicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a different vision than most of
other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, it's a no go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other countries do you guys have
on the horizon that you guys are thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to shoot a few movies in
a few very interesting countries.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We never look what I can say a little bit,
but for security reasons, we don't say
[SPEAKER_06]: where we go because some countries are
very illegal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go in as a national geographic team
with cameras.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to shoot some whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: A deer or bird, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We play that game sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends a little bit where it was,
you know, Russia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is close to Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be all the horses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say where that sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that one is that one is on the radar
and there's three more on the radar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to speed it up the process.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been already fooling around with a
camera, you know, with with my camera guy
[SPEAKER_06]: to do quicker things like five days
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really like to make a documentary,
you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that documentary costs time and a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it costs, you know, preparing,
preferably going the season before to
[SPEAKER_06]: really see how it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then come back to season after or have
really good fixes in the country,
[SPEAKER_06]: which we mostly have, because the surprise
is also really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we what we used to do with Vice,
you know, so like really surprisingly
[SPEAKER_06]: going to a country where you don't know
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything and everything happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, in my case, I always have a
laptop with me with my movies on because
[SPEAKER_06]: people can be very skeptical.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one way or the other, they love to be
in the film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly, I don't know, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there's always a few
exceptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We protect everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see my Swaziland movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are all blurred in their faces so
nobody can see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I do the interview from behind,
you know, so they speak this way and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: sitting there, you know, it depends a
little bit on situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed my group now again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a new group.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have all the camera guys from The
Reppers in Holland.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turned out really nice to Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different angles and whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was quite easy because it was a
legal country.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for example, the first time we had a
Franco's uncle who won the Film Festival
[SPEAKER_06]: of Venice as a camera guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he came with the big boom,
you know, in Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: People freaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they said the boom is us,
you know, do whatever with mics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, the cameras got much better,
you know, and what totally changed
[SPEAKER_06]: everything is the drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the South African.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were making that review.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did 100Ks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was amazing, you know,
the South African one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I call this I want to do South Africa
because this is the area where besides the
[SPEAKER_06]: political thing we're talking about,
we also helped a lot of communities in
[SPEAKER_06]: this world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can tell one is trans guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's millions of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plants growing from us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's only full gas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, she's times Sherbert grows
amazing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Franco's kids were born there in the early
2000 when we worked there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a trans guy was the poorest country in
the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the three, like Sudan, you know,
60% PBC, 40% HIV.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're sleeping in tents with these
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's quite tricky there,
you know, growing a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 years later, I said, listen,
I need to want to make that movie there
[SPEAKER_06]: because also the American helicopters,
the South African pilots would teach like
[SPEAKER_06]: what they do in Colombia, spraying over
the fields, spraying on the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the people run to a big river,
Uzumbuvi River.
[SPEAKER_06]: The helicopters, it's very steep,
so the helicopters cannot reach that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they moved all there and start growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that story.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was 2021.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all quite bored with redoing all
our shops in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to do a movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything was impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one way or the other, through a friend
of mine who's still a friend of us,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he said, listen, call this guy in
Joburg.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got a rafting company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he wants to do it because we had to
do a hundred case of rafting on a river
[SPEAKER_06]: that has never been rafted before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not two guys in a raft.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're big rafts with 300 kilo of supply on
the raft, 10 rafts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're four actors, supporting boats,
chef, you know, the whole lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I called the guy and he said,
Arjan, I've never been on that river.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are not professional rafters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't take the risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to die, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we kept talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at one point I was talking again,
but, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are quite cool guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we can handle a problem,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we start talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I showed him my movies a little bit
more, you know, you know, we train hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were very fit, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, Arjan, are you willing to sign a
non-liable, how you say that?
[SPEAKER_06]: A waiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, I'm not going to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pay me, you also save my company
because it was Corona.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was losing his money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll make a long story.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, listen, I do all these things
under one condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have the best food in the world
on the trip this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause his wife was a chef and I knew that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said, okay, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make a long story short.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went there and the first day was 12
hours in this canoe, in this raft.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we came and then on the side of
the river, on the islands, we put tents
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we sleep in tents, you know,
do barbecue.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went eight days on that river.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did, uh, 200 Ks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the mountains, cold water to the,
where the ocean starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any rapids or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many rapids.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see them in the movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went upside down a few times,
but we are, we're talking about the drone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm explaining this situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there we, and I said, listen,
guys, I want two drones with us,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and, and that's, yeah,
this and that, but he did, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oscar winning movie with Meryl Streep that
was made in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the drone pilot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some Oscar movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was not Meryl Streep,
but one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, he was the drone pilot.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, all right, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, we're going to do the river
rafting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine just drone there?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you go over the raft and then you
see the fields on the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a million dollar shot,
no?
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turned out perfectly, you know,
and that we did in 21, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: with the drones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there, the perception of making the
film changing, you know, also like not
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore with all these big things,
you know, like not necessary, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can make as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have the 360 and the GoPros,
you know, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still sometimes a challenge to get
all the equipment in on the drones and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to talk about Franco for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if you, if that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my book was dedicated to Franco and he
was one of my friends, but he was your
[SPEAKER_00]: best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as his legacy, you want to talk
about his legacy a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's the Franco Aloha Foundation
and I mean, all the videos you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I started working with Franco early
2000.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were 15 years together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in 2001, we got the first
license in the world, medical license.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was in Naltweig with an American guy
called James Burton.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, him, him is in the newspapers,
but of course it was my place,
[SPEAKER_06]: but no, we're not allowed to say that
because the first medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: license was very legal to be affiliated to
a coffee shop guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we financed everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he was working from 99 to 2001 in
my coffee shop on the little one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember upstairs I was living and at
one point in my wife said, I said,
[SPEAKER_06]: I need more growers, I need more growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, go speak to this Italian guy
that's working in the Vatla Plenary two
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very passionate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he would love to grow for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I go there, you know, he just finished
his hotel school in Leeuwarden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I said, it's my dream to work for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: My dream, he said.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took him and then we start growing on
a small scale in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were growing, but I put him in the C
tents, you know, like the small two,
[SPEAKER_06]: three light things, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly James Burton came who was
already supplying me.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, I can get a license for medical
marijuana.
What?
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't even know it was existing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, yeah, but we need a guy in and we
have to put a lot of money, blah,
[SPEAKER_06]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how it went, but Franco
became that guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's still showing the pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have the pictures and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, listen, I have something really
crazy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are the guy going to, you want to
do it?
[SPEAKER_06]: She, of course I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to be three years in a
glass house.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 50 degrees Celsius inside,
which is at 130, 140 in the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to grow medical weed and
we're going to sell it to patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how the whole thing started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I teach him all the growing and how to
do everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in 2005, he became such a
character with me and in my shops and
[SPEAKER_06]: speaking the language.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like a real street kid.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a little bit like my son,
you know, like ducks, friends with,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, with the underground very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, and I thought I was already
working on a Strain Hunter movie after
[SPEAKER_06]: King of Cannabis was only in the shops
with the Cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, okay, now I need to go to the
jungle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do this on my own.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I learned from Hager, you need the
characters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because High Times had all these
characters.
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember the Rocker T's and the
Fantusias and the Hager.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I said, okay, this guy speaks five
languages.
[SPEAKER_06]: He spoke five languages.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a big advantage.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, let's take him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was a great hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because he did Special Forces,
no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was four years Special Forces in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That tiger or lion thing he had here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he was a survivor.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the Special Forces in America?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have two of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Navy SEALs.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the Italian version.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Italian version.
[SPEAKER_06]: Increase the Italian version.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had great fun, you know,
and he had a little bit the same set mind
[SPEAKER_06]: as me, you know, go to more difficult
countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's how we also winded up in Africa
in 2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't start in 2000.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started there, I think, in 2005.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then went Congo, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where India and then Congo,
the disaster happened, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Franco was wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said him a few times to the doctor
when he came back and he said he went,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the doctors told him he didn't have
malaria.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they made that conclusion because he
didn't have fever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in his family, people get sick without
fever, which is a quite rare disease.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a doctor ignored that, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, then shit happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fucking so much fun with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He loved weed more than anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the first night, the first
night I took him to South Africa and he
[SPEAKER_06]: was quite young.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where we were, I think I have footage
of that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's where it's crocodiles.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's bull shark.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's black mamba.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the three worst things you can have.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was Simon lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are there with Simon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm also a long time friend of mine,
of course, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we sleep together in one tent,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably 11, 12 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have to get up at four or five.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and you work in Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: You shoot movie.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the golden hour between six and
eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So four thirty to get out, you know,
you eat something quickly, a coffee and
[SPEAKER_06]: you go shoot.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's we are late and we only can sleep
two hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're lying and the motherfucker puts
light on in the tent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's little light.
[SPEAKER_06]: So put it off, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We go fucking sleep now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have to do I have to roll two
joints, two joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't understand one if I wake up at
three and one for a piss and the other one
[SPEAKER_06]: if I wake up at four thirty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm lying there.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'm not going to argue with this guy
because he's mad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he walks out also out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_06]: He starts rolling the joints and he come
back in a tent and he closes the clothes
[SPEAKER_06]: that put the lights off 10 minutes later,
but he leaves the door open.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said.
[SPEAKER_06]: He left the door open.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, well, fucking mother black mama
come in because it's nice and you within
[SPEAKER_06]: this room will fuck tomorrow morning.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, we find like 20 now grow rooms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have never seen a guy so quickly out
of his bed to close the curtain of the
[SPEAKER_06]: tent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have so many, but we had serious
situations, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're shooting with soldiers and
we went for it, you know, getting chased
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bro, we were in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say on this this part.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say, you know, the part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were in a rough part.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were the only people, white people
going in and out of that area for many
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had some adventures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, he left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the some of the best ones die
young.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we buried our partner just two
months ago in Thailand and buried my best
[SPEAKER_06]: friend seven years ago, buried five
friends in the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's happened when you get a little
bit older and when you are in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you get to 40 and then you
start losing friends and it just gets be
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's why we got to appreciate
each moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the most healthy thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, appreciate life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure your children always come home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The moment you know your children don't
come home anymore, then you did something
[SPEAKER_06]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my parents come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of advice for
younger people coming into this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask both of you guys this
question from your own perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what would that one piece of advice
be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the industry is quite broad,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to become a grower?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it be normal, organic or living soil
and make a craft brand because I think
[SPEAKER_06]: then you have the most chance and have a
dispensary like that you are vertically
[SPEAKER_06]: integrated so you can build up your own
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's our strong point and in
Amsterdam and in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where we grow and you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You like it or you don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, and there's nothing in the
middle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, basically like you see the
really good Michelin star restaurants,
[SPEAKER_06]: they have their own grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have their own farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their own farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: They go pick up their shit in the morning
and they make the best food in the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the ones that don't have contracts
with specific farms and farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: also people that grow specific animals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how successful, any Michelin star
restaurant is successful in the world
[SPEAKER_06]: because there's a limited amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: And why are they successful?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they grow the best organic food
and the only ones that are healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I think my advice would be
grow organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least on soil, you know,
make a good product and see how close you
[SPEAKER_06]: can stay to your customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by selling it in your own dispensary,
you know, or make sure it's marketed well
[SPEAKER_06]: and then put on a shelf in another
dispensary really well, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think if you are small, then you
don't depend on investors.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the best advice I can give
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would your one piece of
advice be for younger people coming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for any industry or just in life,
basically, because I have two older sons
[SPEAKER_05]: as well, going into life, you know,
and going into doing some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: business, you know, where they can make a
living.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so cliche, but I'll explain a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's doing what you really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say you don't work a day in your life
if you do what you love.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the people see for us is the whole
package because there's such a
[SPEAKER_05]: misconception sometimes because of what
the people see on our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get so many comments, of course,
of almost everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like your life is so fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people have no idea that for every
nice thing you see an Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a message just at least 10 or 20
huge, big fucking problems that we have to
[SPEAKER_05]: solve and the shit that we get every day
and from a lot of different sides.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because we have the whole thing and we
have these really nice things,
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole package, I wouldn't do anything
different, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I said to my son too.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that I have to solve so much shit
every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, yeah, basically, that's your job
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're just a problem solver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the day, you have to
switch off and do nice things and make it
[SPEAKER_05]: worth your while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, that's what I would advise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do what you love, but do it with a big
passion.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Passion is you need passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passion is everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have the passion,
then nothing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So circling back to Franco, passion for
the sacred plant, that hashtag that I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to use originally and I still use today,
I started with Franco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were smoking and that came out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passion for the sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that started with Franco a long time
ago and the full gas is your one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his plant, full gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: He always liked it, you know, but that's
why we named it after him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he always just full gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He never had, he didn't had a break.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's peddled to the metal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, that's also why he passed
away, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the reality of life, you know,
like he was too wild, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's his life motto was full gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Full gas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We go for all the, for the hard stuff,
for the, for the good stuff, we go full.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the way in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if he would not be with me,
he would have died like three times
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some crazy stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you know, sometimes you have to
fall a little bit the middle way,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some countries are quite dangerous,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me that day that, because I don't know
if a lot of people know, but he first was
[SPEAKER_05]: a few days in coma, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the day that my, my youngest kid was
born, that was the end of December,
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 December, I walk out of the hospital
with my, my newborn baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I call him up to tell him the good
news.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Franco just went into hospital in
coma.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I traveled to Barcelona also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of days later he died.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was very bizarre period always.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically it's also a metaphor for
life now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you wonder, you know,
why are the politicians killing our own
[SPEAKER_06]: population?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we smoking hydro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it go so far that we just fucked up
everything now?
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, because we are all killing our
own population with the wrong foods,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, all the seed oils we are eating,
which are super bad for your body,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and all these chemicals that are
using, you know, and like the overtone of
[SPEAKER_06]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sugar, especially sugar.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the worst one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the fuel for tumors and bad cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's the worst product on this
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's worse than the drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more people got killed through
sugar than to all the diseases and all the
[SPEAKER_06]: wars together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the math on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So more people got killed from sugar than
from anything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just let it all happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the supermarkets, how supermarkets
are made.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you walk into a supermarket,
which is a genius idea, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you come in, you see only beautiful
colors of the vegetables and fruits to
[SPEAKER_06]: make you happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it stimulates your eye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you walk and you smell the bread.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you wind up at the till with your
little kids with the candy as an eye
[SPEAKER_06]: height, you know, the right one for them,
you know, and then you fill up everything
[SPEAKER_06]: and you take only the shit with you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bread is for nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy is for nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad calories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have to fight the stigma though,
because the association of the retailers
[SPEAKER_05]: association, we got a letter from one of
the biggest sugar candy companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: Haribo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know if you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some companies were making fake
edibles, you know, with their logo and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the letter, it mentioned,
of course, we don't want to be associated
[SPEAKER_05]: with, you know, this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at that letter,
you think, but the problem in our
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, and that's why we're all
fighting is 99% of all people agree with
[SPEAKER_05]: Haribo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and they don't see the
ridiculousness of that letter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we have to protect our dear
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, you know, our own communities
are not within our groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not protected well enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, look in America, everybody's
suing each other in cannabis lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know only about lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely don't want to support the
lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only ones that win in
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can say proudly, we have avoided maybe
15 lawsuits that we all settled outside
[SPEAKER_06]: the room really quickly with idiots,
mostly with staff and stupid things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always try to stay away.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a big problem of our industry,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on top of that, all the listed
companies come in and blow the money of
[SPEAKER_06]: the investors, pops on mom's money,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is why also we are not strong
enough as like the NHL will be or the
[SPEAKER_06]: baseball league or the ice hockey league
or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they are smarter together and all
have one goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our industry, there's a few people who
want to eat the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like the big corpse that are
coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a small crafted grow
that's been pushed out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the guys in North Cal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in Humboldt, it's the worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Humboldt, it's the worst, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and that's why there's also not enough
unity in our world to make that we are
[SPEAKER_06]: stronger and we can fight as a big group,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's so many diversity and
issues and politics and whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas in pharma and in sugar,
they protect each other really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those are really long established
industries too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in a lot of ways we are going in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think some of this takes a lot of
time to stabilize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's finish positive this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are interested in finding out
more about greenhouse seeds, strain
[SPEAKER_00]: hunter, powder feeding, where can they,
Thailand, they're going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand, your next holiday destination,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Thailand, let me say one more
thing, because I would like to end really
[SPEAKER_06]: positive about Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in 103 countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lived in, this is number 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and you, we have a really nice house
together in Sukhumvit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're most welcome to come there one day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beaches, restaurants, logistics,
zero crime, great schools.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the best, maybe the best country.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look everything together,
it's maybe the best country in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can eat a great soup on the street for
$2, even $1.50, him and me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like a proper soup, but there's a line
of people waiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is your next holiday destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally my next holiday destination is
one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can fly to the islands,
everything with your bag full with weed,
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can open for security.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there you can smoke all our products
as they should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like full sun grown, indoor, glass house,
premium indoor, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think I would like to invite
everybody in this world to come and see
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially out of our industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's not enough space for
everybody because it's already a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit like Cali.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's too many coffee shops,
there's too many growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be a natural way that these
things all will settle, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But for tourist people, for people who'd
like to have a nice holiday, it's just one
[SPEAKER_06]: of the best countries in the world to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
