[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today my special guest is Jason
Brooks, one of my good friends from
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've known each other since about 2013
Denver at the Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met in line when I was waiting to get
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you're at the peak of your
high times experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had been caught up in the chef world
for a long time at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis had just become legal in Denver
and the medicinal side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I was really focused on
being a chef at that time, but I was still
[SPEAKER_02]: picking up high times every once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember seeing you quite a bit in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walking into the show, I kind of got a
little fanboy, I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey, dude, that's that's James
Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was a well, it was an amazing
time for cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you I could tell you were talking
about weed and you'd see me in high times
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had extra wristbands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we became friends over that
wristband.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got you in the show and then we hung out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you invited me to your farm
because you were working a farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had the big forty three thousand
square foot under glass in Lafayette,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was one acre under glass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure is the biggest operation in
Colorado at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was a spectacle, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people had never seen
like that was a big grow back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty amazing and impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think you guys struggled
in a lot of ways, too, like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, whoever, you know, starting
out, there's always struggle in trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out and navigate how you do it when
you go to scale like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The craziest part was we found that
property and I believe they were growing
[SPEAKER_02]: carnations back in the 80s before they
moved the cut flower business down to
[SPEAKER_02]: South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found the property and there was
literally mockingbirds nests in the
[SPEAKER_02]: roofing of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was completely naked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no skins on the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had no heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had, you know, terrible water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil had been polluted from the years
of chemical flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning the building, completing the
grow, you know, the build out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of before there was just
a dude you could pick up the phone and
[SPEAKER_02]: say, hey, man, I need a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of course, there's like farm
tech and guys like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys jumped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it wasn't obvious and it wasn't
it wasn't apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't jump off.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you had to you had to really take some
time, sit in the office and dig it out and
[SPEAKER_02]: find that help, find the person that was
willing to work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like even when it came down to
testing genetics, I was running up plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to CSU and getting chased out of the
university by people that were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: get that cannabis off the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they wouldn't even work with you
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: My first experience with cannabis was just
like an after school special, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it really was.
[SPEAKER_02]: My best friend, I'll keep his name quiet
because he works for the government at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some kind of secret whatever past
stuff he can't get in trouble with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it literally was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: His uncle came in town, like left some
weed behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we went around the side of the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked a little bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of at the time I was down in
South Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of my friends were starting to
experiment with alcohol and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I quickly realized it was it was
pretty apparent when you were drunk
[SPEAKER_02]: versus, you know, you can smoke a little
weed and I mean, maybe your eyes got a
[SPEAKER_02]: little red, but you're still coherent and
you're still with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how much back in the quality,
you know, it was a little pre-crippy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like we started off with some
swaggy stuff and moved quickly into the
[SPEAKER_02]: Crip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it went along really well with
my skateboarding and my surfing and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the Crippy,
your experience with the Crippy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had mango on here and we've had some
other people from Florida and Crippy was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much all the good stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of a loose term for kind,
but you know, most of the time it was
[SPEAKER_02]: homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some dudes down there that were
really cranking it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I just remember meeting people
randomly, like at the beach or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, you smoke weed and
then invite that guy to the party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that guy would show up with like an
igloo cooler full of the same cola of
[SPEAKER_02]: Crippy, like just sea of green Crippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it taught me really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like flavor is everything in cannabis,
you know, like if you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: something, especially highly illegal at
the time, it might as well taste good and
[SPEAKER_02]: make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so yeah, that was kind of the- Well,
and I feel like it's one of those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've never experienced it,
you don't know what good weed tastes like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know what you're missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second you taste it,
whether it's at a young age or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's older, then you realize the contrast
between everything else and then the good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say like that experience in
life really paved the road to me becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: a chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was like, well, everybody eats all
day long, but are you putting quality in
[SPEAKER_02]: your mouth?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that definitely was a big
influence on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a huge, like working in the kitchen
has so much, as far as so much in common
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis, like those two fields,
I feel like they're both passion-driven
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think a lot of people see the
financial aspect or did in the past of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but I think also people watch TV
and they're like, Oh, these celebrity
[SPEAKER_01]: chefs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like all glammed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the real kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's not the real world is,
you know, it's like, but there is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a water boys and dishwashers have a
lot in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's valuable to learn all
those things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing how many similarities there
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then palette wise too, like,
I feel like that's where I develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my palette from both, you know,
I feel, I feel most of us that worked in
[SPEAKER_01]: the kitchen, it's like, it's all from
collecting data points, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, the more data points you have
over time, the more developed your palette
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more things you experience,
you figure out what you like, what you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at a certain point, you can
figure out what other people like too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's one of the things that
makes cooking special too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always about what you like,
but, but understanding what everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: likes or what most people would like going
in there, what they would be impressed
[SPEAKER_01]: with or, or, you know, add to the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at the end of the day, it's all
about an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for a restaurant to be successful,
there has to be some form of a massive
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal, you know, something's got to hit
and resonate with everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where you get certain
strains of cannabis that become legendary
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the Crippie down in the
South, Blue Dream out here in Cali,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like those things hit and they
resonated for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Crippie somehow turned into OG
Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, Crippie was kind of
encompassing, but then it emerged as the
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush cut that we know today is OG Kush,
which is like that earthy piney gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was, you know, the successful
growers in Florida that were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: attract some, a little bit of gravitas and
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they got the West coast
people paying attention and they were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to come out here and make OG like a
California thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I don't think of OG as,
or like Crippie's Florida, but OG is
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Soup Dog, Ricky Palomino,
Cypress Hill, all those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and those guys were pushing the
envelope in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the cool thing about cannabis
for me, man, is it just, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's brought my best friends into my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brought my wife into my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was running around Athens,
Georgia for a little while in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were definitely, we were selling swag
to buy good bud, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually got to a point where we
make enough money that we rented Bon
[SPEAKER_02]: Jovi's tour bus and his driver to take us
down to the dead shows from Athens to
[SPEAKER_02]: Atlanta in 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I met my wife,
man, on a Grateful Dead lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was like, Hey, you want to get on
the bus and come check it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she got on the bus and never got off,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in the mid nineties?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was March 31st, 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how the Grateful Dead has so
much influence over, or not even
[SPEAKER_01]: influence, but impact on the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cannabis industry wouldn't be
what the cannabis industry is without the
[SPEAKER_01]: impact from the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, so many of us have stories that
revolve around either the lot or around
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics that came from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Athens, you know, like as soon as
the kids left town after school got out,
[SPEAKER_02]: typically there was a huge drought all
through the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where like summer tours of the
Grateful Dead coming through would
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely save the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you'd load up on your
glass, you load up on your mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: you load up on your, you know,
your jars of weed and totally try to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it through, you know, pinch it,
pinch it through till till everything came
[SPEAKER_02]: back around in the spring, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I started growing is
because I was like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we running out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if we can just grow it,
let's grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when do you start growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first plants were in high school in
1994.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a window in my basement and I
planted a bunch of plants in my window and
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went away on a little trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came back home and all my plants are
sitting on the kitchen table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my my parents are basically like,
you know, you said this is Basil and I
[SPEAKER_02]: have a really cool uncle and he was like,
that's that's not based.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so he blew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blew.
[SPEAKER_02]: He blew my cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it all worked out well because I was
able to, you know, I graduated from high
[SPEAKER_02]: school and then went up the road to
Athens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the first plant I was gifted was a
mother plant, a big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in nineteen ninety six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing had been topped forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it probably had 50 tops on it when
I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It showed up in one of the big old school
TV boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to be square.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it took up the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my good buddies is like,
we need a grow light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, back then you couldn't just
go to the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So or you had to go to the electrical shop
and build one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was outside of my realm of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we stole one from my community college.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like a four hundred watt
HPS or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when the light was on,
also like, you know, like could have lost
[SPEAKER_02]: a good friend in that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that thing went into a closet
and what doesn't kill you only only makes
[SPEAKER_02]: a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the first plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it was 90s big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke wasn't all that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and then I got into, you know,
still Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of penalties to be paid if you
got caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mostly gorilla growing and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember my dad sitting down at the
kitchen table and being like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: whose plants those were in the woods,
but they just had crop failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like trying not to react at the
dinner table, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, man, I grew all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, the Athens thing went good for a
while till it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had some we had a federal
thing happen and one of my buddies,
[SPEAKER_02]: a really kind of my best friend at the
time, started wearing a wire and actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was it was it was a weird time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's houses started getting kicked
in and we didn't know what was going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: My best friend at the time, like the guy
that had all the weed and the best weed
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden didn't have any weed,
you know, and he was asking us for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things just got weird, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one by one, they all got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I don't really know exactly
because I never talked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ever talk to any officers about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I was so low on the totem
pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think they had who they
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually go for the big fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's kind of especially back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like get them, you know, hit them
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they hit people hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hit people hard, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my friends, you know,
like their parents had to put their houses
[SPEAKER_02]: up to keep their kids out of jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like just stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, yeah, they seize property to seize
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So asset forfeiture sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, this the whole the road
has been so weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what sent me to culinary
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, I got to learn a
trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get out of this and get into
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to the Art Institute of
Atlanta and learned to become a chef and
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then did that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that forever, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was drinking the Kool-Aid,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm not doing anything else
besides being a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty of being a chef is you're a
chef forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn that once you learn how to cook,
it just changes your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like learning how to grow,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You once you understand the plant,
once you understand the kitchen and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a formula to it and everybody
makes their own formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go along, you learn things and you
pick up things from different cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you understand how food works
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it's an amazing thing to be
able to just kind of create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's there's an artistic side to
it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, culinary school gives you the
the intros and the hows and the whys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you learn that, it's it's
kind of like all cuisine is pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have a different set of
ingredients to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, yeah, same with cannabis,
same with growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I knew I instantly realized
like I didn't want to work at a Chili's.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to cut something out of a
bag and pour it in and call that soup of
[SPEAKER_02]: the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that approach worked me in
cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm not a hydro guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't want to take part A part B
and then throw in some C and then call it
[SPEAKER_02]: my creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think that's no shame on
anybody doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just not me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to like, oh, I made this input and
I put that input on to ground up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it reflects in your flower,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some good flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I love smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I go to Colorado, that's one of
the places I look forward to going to is
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always love to see you show up,
man, and show you what I've been working
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was that big flood we
had in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was running that greenhouse,
we had a huge flood come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it was I think it's 10 years
ago, September.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it literally cut my town in half,
you know, like we had to drive all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: around just to get to town.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my greenhouse, I remember waking up at
four o'clock in the morning and turning on
[SPEAKER_02]: the news and seeing that Lafayette was
underwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I jumped in my truck at five o'clock
in the morning and drove to that
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like an episode of Ghost
Hunters, like the trash cans floating
[SPEAKER_02]: across the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just the kitty cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we had Durbin was all the way in the
rafters, like he was hiding out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of that, it locked up the
ground so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were in the ground organ or trying
to be as organic as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we couldn't grow anything like we were
getting every kind of anything you could
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was fungal based, it was in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was just any nightmare to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost like a Bad Bugs Bunny
cartoon, like when the little all the
[SPEAKER_02]: carrots start disappearing, you know,
going down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd water a plant and it would die.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd water a plant and it would die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had two or three growers at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all kind of, you know, we're head
butting a little bit on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every time we put chemicals into the
soil, it was worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like salt based stuff would just would
kill things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I got to know Brian from
Vital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Carl Gorka from Photosynthesis Plus
Microb Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I started reaching out to all
these organic guys and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, like how do we stop this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and Brian's answer was compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I was like, OK, you know,
I'm with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought in a master horticulturist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, OK, all right, now we're
getting somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started bringing in better supplies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't water anything because as soon
as water hit the ground, it locked up
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started foliar feeding compost teas
and we turned that grow around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it took we still got a crop in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly, I think I watered
the crop one time in 90 days and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else is foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, we had Jurassic Leaves on these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to see the connection here,
you know, and so, yeah, through the
[SPEAKER_02]: organics, you know, I learned about
probiotics, which brought me to Alan
[SPEAKER_02]: Atkinson and Grokashi using his products
and then watching everything change,
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the soil change, watching the
composition of the soil change,
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the pH of the soil change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, yeah, I guess my point is like
feeding cannabis in that situation taught
[SPEAKER_02]: me how to feed myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, why am I not
drinking coconut water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do I not take aloe?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, why do I not eat
probiotics?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was I was just coming out of my chef
career, which they tell you in culinary
[SPEAKER_02]: school, like fat is flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like any time you can throw more
butter in there, hit it with some cream,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that's the problem just
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You love I do love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a good energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the problem right now today with
people's eating is that they're eating
[SPEAKER_01]: processed foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I think butter's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, butter's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think exercise and eating raw
ingredients is the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now I understand, like through like
fermented products, you know, like your
[SPEAKER_02]: kimchi's and your kombucha's and your
sauerkraut's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're looking at KNF, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like these guys are just
fermenting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And micronizing those things and applying
them straight to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's eating itself or the plant's
eating whatever it wants to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're doing that, eating the
fermented stuff, everything is micronized
[SPEAKER_02]: for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier for our bodies to uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's good for our body pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I actually just read an article
about how similar the root system is in
[SPEAKER_02]: soil versus our gut system in our
microbiota.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the cool takeaways from the
article was, you know, like if people have
[SPEAKER_02]: like surgeries and stuff like that and
their their probiotics completely shut
[SPEAKER_02]: down, you know, like and they're basically
dying of like diarrhea and dysentery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a fecal transplant that you can
do, you know, where you actually take
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't sound like what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically eating a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eating a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have an ulcerative colitis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know all about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I do cold punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I read in this article that a
compost tea is just like doing a fecal
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant for the soil, which makes
totally made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, so yeah, it's just
like when things aren't right,
[SPEAKER_02]: you take what is right and apply it in and
then let the symbiotic process occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting to learn so much more
science about like GI issues and also
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science is just kind of there's a lot of
stuff we knew, but we're learning a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, I think, you know,
especially about eating things that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was saying like fat is
flavored, like there's a big difference
[SPEAKER_02]: between like grass fed beef butter,
you know, like grass fed butter or whorl
[SPEAKER_02]: oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I've worked with places
like grab the whorl and put it on the
[SPEAKER_02]: green beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, what the fuck is whorl?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, and it's just some crazy
oil, some hydrogenated, hydrogenated oil
[SPEAKER_02]: that tastes like butter, you know,
like it's made for a buffet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your butter, your butter never breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's cheap butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap butter, but that's kind of
stuff that I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the spice of butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how spices to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, so it became like,
I realized quickly the best way to raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can, I know it's not for
everybody, but the best way to raise
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in my book is to feed it
organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I just, I mean, I do shop at
whole foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: I eat mostly organic food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I strictly pay check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're freaking out the other day when
you can check out with your palm now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I think I'll skip that tech,
but I appreciate your celery juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finger prick.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it's, it's interesting and
how, how these things relate and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much crossover, you know, in life and
then with your family and then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: raising your kid on these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my wife thinks I'm crazy because
I'm always, you know, like if I'm cooked
[SPEAKER_02]: rice, then I'm shaking it in rice water
and I'm making my own labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's always a project on my
counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like right now I know there's,
there's a huge thing of garlic fermenting
[SPEAKER_02]: and honey on the counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it does become a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem that's going on right now is,
you know, we're sending our kids off to
[SPEAKER_02]: school with heads full of sugar and
artificial colors and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they can't concentrate at school
and then it's your kid's fault,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then you get mad at the
teacher for not engaging your kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, like feed your kid
whole foods and teach your kid how to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's what's really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like stop the disconnect, teach your kids
how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think also like, if you're a
meat eater, I don't vegetarian,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, if you eat meat, you should
understand the process of how animals come
[SPEAKER_01]: to end up on your plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the whole process of all that stuff
and understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, all these things are lost art.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love, since I'm in Colorado,
I'd love to embrace more hunting and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always have like a full freezer of
some good elk and stuff to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elk's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elk's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like a lot of different kinds of
meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like bear, bear jerky too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bear is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shot a big old bear and we made some
stew out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bear can vary so much from animal to
animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what they're eating on and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the trash bear out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much all animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, yeah, it's, I mean, cannabis is
taught me how to feed myself completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's really not much difference
between like the amount of salt we can
[SPEAKER_02]: take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we think of as salt, like for us,
it's like, there's different types of salt
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there's table salt,
which is very linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's sea salt, which is very
complex.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's all the components also,
like magnesiums and all those other
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like those plants, I mean,
we know like growing cannabis is all about
[SPEAKER_02]: your micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same, same, like that's gotten me
every morning taking a little Celtic sea
[SPEAKER_02]: salt and dropping it under my tongue and
getting all, you know, getting all my good
[SPEAKER_02]: vitamins in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I mean, she's, she's the one
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the goddess.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like the number one woman of the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I personally think it's really hard
to wrap around my head that like an orange
[SPEAKER_02]: could taste like cannabis or a cannabis
can taste like orange, but a cannabis can
[SPEAKER_02]: also taste like any other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like Green Dot Dave's got the A5
Wagyu out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you haven't tried that,
I mean, it's a greasy meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some fried chicken turps before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fried chicken turps for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that lemon G.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lemon G.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I got the lemon G from
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it from someone in Colorado,
but that lemon G is fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fire, but it's also got like a
funky fried chicken gas station,
[SPEAKER_02]: like bathroom in an Alabama gas station
where they fry their own chicken turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's borderline offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really comes through in the
concentrate too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love borderline offensive too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go a lot of borderline offensive weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your GMOs and your chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 91 ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the best expressions I've
ever had of ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what I smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, man, my Rhino gig led me
to hang out at Elite Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of brought me in as a consultant
because they were moving into the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we needed a little, you know,
I wanted to help them with a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more production stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, that was, that was the most
loaded bench of growers I've ever gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Graham from Crickets in Zucada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Jamie who's famous for the
headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a dude named Jack Love,
Matt Fordyce, Dave Von Villan,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I mean, he's a gangster himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you kept like paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like painting guitars and stuff
he's doing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude got to go on Slayer's world tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: As their weed tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like taking all the weed that we grew
around the world of Slayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, somehow he became Kerry
King's guitar tech, like through the tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, we, I mean, this,
this group of growers that I got to hang
[SPEAKER_02]: out with every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean, we started work at seven o
'clock, which meant smoking OG at like
[SPEAKER_02]: seven 15 and drinking coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would leave the table at like
10 30 higher is the balance though,
[SPEAKER_02]: higher than giraffe pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like way up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, okay, let's get to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like, Oh, let's get to
lunch.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the, the information that I
gathered from all those guys and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this is still, this is a couple
of years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a lot of bro science still,
you know, but sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pushing to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can, we could get to the,
where we, where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like it takes a lot of
trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't understand cause
we're standing on the shoulders of giants
[SPEAKER_01]: and these are such big giants that we
don't even really see the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've done necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the work's been going on for 45,
50 years really, and then even 2000 years
[SPEAKER_01]: in the making, but we're standing on the
shoulders of some amazing giants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of trial and error to
get to where we are today to get funneled
[SPEAKER_01]: into gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just grew some outdoor runs this year in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I see why it's got,
you know, I see why it's got his good
[SPEAKER_02]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I totally love the appeal of some of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally like the flavor,
but I also love diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that comes from the chef
background too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is not just like sitting around
getting stoned for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, okay, what's going to
start my day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get my, get my processes going,
you know, get my, whether it's get my
[SPEAKER_02]: exercise in, get the dog out for a walk,
like just make a list, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like the mid day stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, once I'm done working,
like I'm 47 now, man, my body hurts,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so I'm ready to smoke some of
that dog walker or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to put me in the couch and
put me, you know, in a good space,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting ready to get you to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I feel like stimulants are good
in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is data stuff at night, but I have
like things like OG Kush where I can smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: them day or night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles is another one I smoke in the
morning and smoke it at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm constantly changing when I'm
smoking and probably smoking whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: best shit I have is what I smoke first.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've, you know, I have built up a
tolerance for all the Kims and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can still function, but I,
I personally like to be a little scared
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking me like there's something about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings me more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more attentive actually to like
everything around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypersensitive almost, but not in a bad
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in a paranoid way, but just,
you know, like, no, but where you can be
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable in that borderline place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's kind of how mushrooms work
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once you get, like at first it's
like, it can be borderline, like not micro
[SPEAKER_01]: dose, but I'm not talking about micro
dose, but I'm talking about like a real
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we do grew up doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, uh, now everyone's on the
micro dose kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like technically you get the most
benefit from doing the larger doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms and it is borderline scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you learned how to relax,
then you can really appreciate,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, everything it has to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms are amazing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, last time I had one of those trips
was about a year and a half ago and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.5 grams of this Brazilian strain that my
buddy grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of lemon tech, I did
grapefruit tech, you know, I'd heard,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, I heard this works better,
whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made this little grapefruit thingy
and, um, it was 3.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I blended it into this tiny
little grapefruit margarita.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a little tiny tequila and a
little tiny Grand Marnier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, I mean, it was a shot and I
shot that thing down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time I could clean the blender,
I was having like DMT visuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't know what was going on,
but yeah, it hit me so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the strongest trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking back, I'm like,
there's no way I could be in a public
[SPEAKER_02]: setting right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I felt like I was DNA going
through somebody's like bloods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, but I do microdose a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do microdose like five times or five
days a week, try to take a couple of days
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you were the first person to get
me on microdoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, you gave me some pills in
Denver one time that had a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different mushrooms, including the 15
mushroom blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the 15 mushroom blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were like real microdose too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, you weren't taking
them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you got high, you were taking them
for the mushroom benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, like everybody's got
their traumas and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the more I learned about
the brain and like, uh, concussions and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that, like how, I mean,
I, I did surf, I skateboarded,
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of football,
you know, like, yeah, I've taken some,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I fought, I used to be a fighter,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've taken some shots and, um,
now, yeah, now that I'm in my forties,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, we got to protect this
noodle, you know, cause I'm looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: next 40 and I don't want to be,
you know, useless as far as my brain or
[SPEAKER_02]: my, my vocabulary and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I, I do, I spend a lot of time,
um, trying to rebuild those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about cold punch a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge cold punch fan and I do these
longer plunges now, which is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: goes, goes against a lot of stuff you
read, but I feel like you got to listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: your body and give your body what it
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I do days where I do 15
minute plunges now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, well, Joe Rogan did like 20 and
then Rick Rubin, he did like a 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: he says he did a 30, but I saw Joe Rogan's
20 minute plunge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I realized that anything's
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just listen to your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's too much, like as you're
building it up, you don't go past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go past five minutes for the
longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think three, three minutes and 30
seconds has been about it depends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a little warmer temperature so I
can go for longer, but you get in more of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a meditating type meditative state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, I feel like it's in a,
you're in a different state of mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with the cold, like then you
start breathing through it and relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the moment too, cause you're
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the very first initial plunge is,
it's pretty ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm like not in control of my
vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know, like, yeah,
I do it every day now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do it every day first thing in the
morning, right when I get out of bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're hot from sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when you get in, it's almost like
going in the sauna.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get one for my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I live in Colorado, so cold
plunge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can literally be just run outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time of year, you could probably just
put a trough out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a baby pool and just go crack the ice
and jump in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, I was thinking like,
this has been, the past couple of years
[SPEAKER_02]: have been the year of the cold plunges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, maybe I'll just wait and
see what pops up on the Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just snacking on the cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, I mean, you can buy the $10,000
ones on the internet or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Morosco, which I think it's bad ass,
it's $10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you can make one for $2,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if you're in a cold,
cold enough region, I just, I'm so worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about balancing out everything like
chemical wise, because you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't do it right, you can get
bacteria infections and die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing I've, you know,
I'd worry about kind of doing it by
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself or like fainting, you know,
from like holding your breath or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first, when I first started doing it,
I'm like, what if I have a heart attack?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of like going through my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I did it, I used to dump a
vice and I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a jacuzzi tub and I go in the
jacuzzi tub and it was super cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a week, you start realizing like
even not doing it every day, you start
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing that you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now even at the cold temperatures,
I can go in them and I don't feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to faint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you feel a little lightheaded at
first, but like, it's all about breathing
[SPEAKER_01]: and knowing that you're safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the, doing it regularly,
you develop that too, where you realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're safe, even if you're going
extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is amazing the power of breath
and your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, if you can, if you connect those
to my yoga teacher back in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, she's like, watch how fast your
heart changes when you focus on your
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing and like, or just how,
like how your shoulders settle,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and everything, your face is
tight, you relax your face, all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, all of a sudden you realize
your tongue's not pressing against the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of your head all the time, you know,
like relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: When time really slows down, when you're
doing cold plunging, my day goes by like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems like I wake up and I'm
doing all these things and the next thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know is the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that's getting older,
but also we can look at life in
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, but that, that small amount
of time in the morning, whether it's five
[SPEAKER_01]: or 10 or 15 minutes, it's not 15 minutes
every day, but I've been doing like
[SPEAKER_01]: building up to the 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it really slows life down and then
I don't drink coffee first thing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like gives me what I need to wake
up and be, I'll drink coffee in the
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon or if I smoke a bunch of weed
and then I'm like, I feel tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: But coffee is the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way it makes me feel and coffee
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like those two are meant to go
together like one chefs and coffee working
[SPEAKER_01]: as a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're working long hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like coffee is just part of the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with cannabis, it kind of
balances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be with drinking and being a
chef growing weed and making seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like smoking weed all day,
you got to have the coffee to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: balance it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have appreciated getting older and not
having such a like crazy head of steam,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like when you're younger,
it's just like, all right, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: put your head down and plow through
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting older is definitely like,
okay, like separating things and taking
[SPEAKER_02]: time to listen to your body and heal your
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you know, it's not all go,
go, go these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got to have some downtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's funny because there's there's
different ways of doing stuff in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like part of the chef mentality
is because you're you're working so fast
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything's you're only as good as
your last plate to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you have to make snap decisions
and you have to be right the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the thing is, is like,
yeah, you make mistakes and you learn from
[SPEAKER_01]: your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, like in the restaurant,
because it's repetition time and time
[SPEAKER_01]: again, you learn how to navigate through
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you can correct mistakes where you
almost make mistake and you correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's nights on the line where
you're cooking to where it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's almost falling apart,
literally almost falling apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you feel like you're failing the whole
time, but you pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in between your ears.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the papers did like your fucking
tickets just stacking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those experiences in the kitchen
made every day in the grow that much
[SPEAKER_02]: easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because I'm like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to burn yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to you might cut
yourself, but it's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: nick of some scissors or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to deal with all those, like you just
said, all those problems and all those
[SPEAKER_02]: things that arose all the time and having
to put out the fire, pivot, put out the
[SPEAKER_02]: fire, pivot, replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I mean, those are those are
the things that define you to a degree and
[SPEAKER_01]: like mentally also prepare you those type
of moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they really prepare you for
other things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you realize how small some of the
things that we worry about so much are,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that that phrase,
this too shall pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this too shall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hard times and the good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, no matter how bad it
seems like it is, it's like you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass into something else eventually,
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so breathing, getting through those
moments, you know, it's like I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how many times over the last 10 years it's
like seemed like it was just tough and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like everything was, you know,
at the lows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then your lows become highs and then
your highs then become lows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at the end of the day,
you just have to put one foot in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's days where you just
got to get up and suck it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you don't just get to stay
in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get up and you power through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing, you know, you've been out
to the hemp farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was we were getting ready for one
season and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I think starting in like November,
December, I started all the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had these plants perfect, like the best
looking mother is completely organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing going on with them as far as bugs
and which no bugs in a greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is pretty easy, you know,
because everything outside is dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got into the cloning and first set
of cloning went great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We needed to cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was one hundred and twenty five
thousand clones to populate the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: First twenty five thousand went fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next hundred thousand clones,
we would cut them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would look perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd walk in the greenhouse and these
things are folded over within twenty four
[SPEAKER_02]: hours and nobody knew what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we saw people up too much
airflow, too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's all these opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it is some kind of pathogen that
was inside that greenhouse that was just
[SPEAKER_02]: jumping in there and knocking these things
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't even talk about pathogens
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that was just it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're like, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pythium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, you know, we don't know where it is
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're bro scientists at this point,
you know, just trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like getting up every morning to go check
that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twenty four hours after I cut those
clones, like I didn't even I couldn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: drink coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so stressed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sweat would be pouring out of my
hands on the steering wheel and then just
[SPEAKER_02]: to whip open that greenhouse door and see
them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fold it over.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, OK, I'm like,
pull in the bobcat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw all these in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bucket goes the compost file, you know,
and like one foot in front of the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cutting that many clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like being on the Viking
ship and somebody just like boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you just got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you go from being a chef to
transition and doing it scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we met, you were you were at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been working at scale with farmers,
hemp farmers growing massive amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: acres for hemp and huge greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you go from being a home grower
and a chef to get into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the little bit of medical time as soon
as medical popped off a buddy of mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was living on an 80 acre farm in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to push the envelopes a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built four big greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was basically going off of what I had
seen in greenhouse production in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, like through high times or
what, you know, I kind of was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, these plants need to be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to fill out the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got to have some airflow,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had I think it was two seasons under
my belt, Colorado, outdoor and these big
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when all the venture
capitalists and all that started to come
[SPEAKER_02]: into Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, a bunch of dudes are coming in
town with a bunch of money.
And.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this one guy, I'd walk through my
greenhouse with an iPad and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a bunch of pictures or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he showed it to one of these guys and
this guy showed up and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're hired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're fired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like this whole is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I want you to look at this
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he showed me this property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, we've got to rebuild this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to do it exactly like you
did it over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I mean, I went from four
greenhouses that were like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 31 20s to forty three thousand square
feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what it is, it's like it's just
like being a chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like it really doesn't
matter if you're cooking one cover or if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're cooking a thousand covers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to prepare for it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And and yeah, just see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the little stuff first, all the way
out to the big picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, I I didn't have any
staff at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the local skate park.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found I love skateboarders are my dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I'm going to hire anybody,
they're either going to be a wrestler from
[SPEAKER_02]: high school or a skateboarder,
because those two people are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most driven people that you could ever
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like to be able to ride a
skateboard on a ramp or in a park and to
[SPEAKER_01]: fall down repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it over and over and over and over and
back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And think about what you did wrong and do
it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fall down seven, stay up eight.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to little Jason Henderson,
little Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was big Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was little Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy followed me, you know,
helped me out a ton at that place and went
[SPEAKER_02]: to Washington with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah, man, he was a guy that
could like he knew vegetation and cloning
[SPEAKER_02]: like just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just in his blood, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny those life lessons that
you can apply to cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you and not even cannabis,
but doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of all follows suit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to be good at something,
it doesn't matter whether it's growing or
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you want to play the guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to learn how to do this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to you know, you got to fail a
bunch along the way to really learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it properly or to be really good at it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very much using your eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's using your brain and using
your eyes and looking at things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you should be able to read a
plant just by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, well, what's going on with
that plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is it the stems green all the way
through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have any little purple streaks
going through it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, it looks like you missed out on
some nitrate there, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like just being it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just being able to read those plants like
that and read it from afar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, and repetition over and over and
over and learning how to do it your own
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, all these cultivars,
they're all just like anybody else in your
[SPEAKER_02]: life, you know, like, you know,
certain things about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, OK, like that Afghani or that
hash plant, you know, like she likes to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit wider and a little bit
loamier soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't like all that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't like dense soil, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, geez, as little water as possible,
but as often as possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with a ton of calcium and magnesium to
help things move around in that little
[SPEAKER_02]: spaghetti like stem, you know,
like it's just, yeah, they all have their
[SPEAKER_02]: nuances and the spaghetti down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like my favorite stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, dude, yeah, it's just like,
come on, you're only stand up straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just yeah, it's getting to know
them all and and how they work for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like that's what we saw,
like especially in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's really hard to find a
dispensary that's got like pre-98 Bubba
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush now, because like the plant,
there's a whole bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it fit into the I mean, it was
finished early.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was definitely benefits,
but the pre-98 isn't really what you see
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a Bubba Kush that the one that
finishes in like 50 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and I think that's burgers,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, that was just it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it was a little bit longer
to clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of screwed up your two week
routine and your clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as opposed to having it ready for
the field in 21 days, it might need 35.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it screwed up your time and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you've got this huge
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you saw I had 14 foot 14 foot wide
blue dreams or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: super lemon hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got this little blue dream or
this little Bubba Kush, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging out and, you know, investors are
walking by.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, what's wrong with that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't look like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, California, we had the mids market
was filled with Bubba and they grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had number three, they had number
four, and it kind of turned it around and
picked up the green.
And then it had number eight, the numbers
that were in the last month, that's like
it was a giant number 10 scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you wouldn't believe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but then that's kind of transitioned in
the runs Gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemon cherry gelato runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, gelato is all the
different gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 three 40 ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm, you know, in Colorado,
I'm always about two and a half years
[SPEAKER_02]: behind what you guys are up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes that long for us to actually get
our hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you got the plug over here that's-
Eventually it's going to come back all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fun to watch new markets open
up because that's when you find some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these strains that we considered gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, some dude in Oklahoma has
had it in his closet for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just talking to Crockett.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily fit into the
commercially popular varieties of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're enjoying today on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun one to grow and it's quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a user-friendly plant pretty much
from A to Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely has a spot to be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: With food, I think one of the biggest
things is you build this foundation and
[SPEAKER_01]: you learn how to make a dish and then make
your own twisted as a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're coming in, whereas with
breeding, it's a different thought
[SPEAKER_01]: process, but you've been getting into
breeding too over the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that going?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it more of a part of me wants to
be a preservation breeder and increase
[SPEAKER_02]: what's already- I would hate for something
to go away just because people lost
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old enough to know that one day Jinkos
are going to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: All these- Jinkos are like $400 a pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw somebody wearing Doc Martens the
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, wow, that reminds me of 1994 in
high school or the punk rock scene,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is even older than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it all comes back around.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was first concerned about,
I wanted to push as many cannabinoids into
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant as I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was coming from the hemp field to the
lab because it used to be a pain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ass to be like, oh, well, I've got this
CBG strain here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this section of the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got this CBC over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all my VAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to batch them for the lab to
figure it out versus knowing what happens
[SPEAKER_02]: in the lab and the fact that they can just
spill over whatever they want to spill
[SPEAKER_02]: over and grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started working on a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it The Noid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dates me from the old Domino's
commercials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid the Noid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabinoid plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to just push as much as I
could into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really- You were looking for the
most amount of diversity or complexity as
[SPEAKER_01]: you- To possibly push into a plant.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I ended up with, I mean, this thing
is nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is loaded with DG, lots of C,
but she's stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is very much like a Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I took that and I put it into other
things like puck, more hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're digging in that puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to go BX on that and because of the
fact that puck was- That's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hardest plants I've ever had to hang on
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is so finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do an increase on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I also wanted to do for the hemp
farmers, I wanted to do triple crop was
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming a big thing to get your seed,
your fiber, and your cannabinoids all in
[SPEAKER_02]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to go for something that was
14 feet tall with no offshoots at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was packing on about a foot,
foot and a half tall coal on the top
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just loaded with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically breeding the intersex traits
into it and having the complete- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I was realizing as modern
hemp farming in Europe, they take the tops
[SPEAKER_02]: off the plant, grab everything they want
there, and then they let it basically sit
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field for a little bit longer and
that outer, it'll decorticate itself
[SPEAKER_02]: really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll like take this sheath off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you got that pure fiber down below
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to go for that where it's
like, okay, harvest your cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: your food products first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then come back and get your fiber content
classed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, now I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all this purple gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just talking about star killer and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love star killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing is with the green,
I feel like you want stronger stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be green and not purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People always want what they can't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want this purple stuff and then they
want it to be super potent and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is some stuff that's borderline
strong, but it's not like the gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that gassy stuff was its own era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the hazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the first good weed that I got,
there's a dude around Athens, Georgia that
[SPEAKER_02]: was growing the Swazi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, the Swazi, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Swazi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could take five little calyxes
and put it into a bowl and go throw a
[SPEAKER_02]: frisbee for four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like completely psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was completely ceilingless.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you smoke, the higher you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff isn't like that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a quarter of it was like that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of stuff in Europe too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not announced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a big quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was tripping on acid one night and the
homie came through with a jar of it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: literally shut down my ability to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had to totally shut it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, I can't talk.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your favorite thing to grow and
what's the best thing you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, right now my favorite thing to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a total accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out of my old trap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a room full of Kim and I had a room
full of Crippy and I found one seed in a
[SPEAKER_02]: Crippy Bud and I popped that thing and it
turned into this like OG KB looking plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: slow growing, silver purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got like this almost like a soapy,
piffy smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really heavy buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's really creepy in the buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it the Ducky because it's got
just a complete duck leaf and that's my
[SPEAKER_02]: son's nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just by coincidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Ducky is my favorite to grow right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll never be a production strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am, you know, I try to run through
all the hypey stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flower it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like everything that Chris has
been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I don't think he's with Compound
anymore, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that guy's stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Compound that's not with Compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know his last name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Christopher Lynch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I did know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris is a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only had good experiences with Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've popped a bunch of his Joker stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Acai was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything he's doing,
I think it's all solid work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fletch from Archive, I think consistently
puts out the hits and I think he puts out
[SPEAKER_02]: the hits that people talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott Reach is a dear friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything Red Angus does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does some good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does some great work, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Star Killer is epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some Star Killer flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the same cut going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time that we've kept alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed me a Star Killer cut and a Flow
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Flow OG went on to win second
place in the Adam Dunn thing a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll date myself five years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam is a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam is a total character.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the phone with him earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at MJ Biz this year, him and I are
releasing Sage Against the Machine
[SPEAKER_01]: Crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that part of the Sage and Sour project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the seeds and he helped curate the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did the packaging and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did the breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on his show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked some Sage and Sour that a buddy
had sifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Sage and Sour crosses or was it
actual Sage and Sour?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sage and Sour from a few years
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wild, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the one that has the open bud
structure the most where it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: nested, not the nested bracts,
but very open and podgily where the bracts
[SPEAKER_01]: stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to get it at Harborside,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff tasted crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted like a blend of Sour and Sage
with a lot of gas in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a really unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all the diesels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still hang on to the day record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an East Coast Sour Diesel I like
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an Albany Sour Diesel that I'm
really digging on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I like those old flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not scared to try anything new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get the potency on some of the
newer stuff that I prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think back on my younger self.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, man, if I was smoking this when
I was 19, I wouldn't leave the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just sit here and smoke this all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find myself with some of these rosins
where I'll have them in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm watching TV or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep smelling it over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little aroma therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking the turps away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, taking all the aroma out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I enjoy just the smell of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's one of the beauties of
the cannabis plant is it has these amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles that we can really relate to and
we get excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a diverse plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like what I was saying
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's... I'm just a dude,
but I find it impossible that everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else...
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis can smell like everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like that has to be the first
plant that created terpenes and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else evolved into... Well, it's
interesting because you think you could
[SPEAKER_01]: take cucumbers and breathe them into all
kinds of... I mean, there's lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: cucumbers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is the most cultivated plant
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more variety, not most cultivated,
but there's more diversity in cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if we applied all that same
diversity to cucumbers or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: cruciferous related from... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My latest pivot, man, I'm not done with
cannabis by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the industry is just in a place where
I'm not as involved right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of taking a step back, watching the
plane circle, the runway a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some behind the scenes work that I
feel will be prudent work whenever I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to pop it back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I met a really awesome dude,
Grant, my man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's got a flower farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, that's been the biggest pivot
for me is growing these dahlias and
[SPEAKER_02]: checking out... You talk about a diverse
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: These dahlias, I forget the set of
chromosomes they have, but it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to cannabis where you can start
breeding something and you might not get
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that looks like mother or father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all these recessive traits and then
inbreeding too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at cruciferous and how it
evolved into like wild mustard,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it evolved into all these different
things where they're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: broccoli, cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that amount of diversity too,
if you go back into something like wild
[SPEAKER_01]: mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the potential for what we can do with
the plant even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that we're scratching the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in some ways with technology,
we're scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential is going to be even more
amazing, I think, in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think you're right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when we were playing with it,
you weren't allowed to play with this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything had to be kept quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very much a quiet society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's like we can share the
information, we can share the cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram, everybody's talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or you're going to have the ability
to sell somebody their favorite cut and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll show up 24 hours after they click a
button.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, it used to be, dude, start going
through the old hippie Rolodex and see who
[SPEAKER_02]: you knew and track it down or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, make a long trip, a road trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dangerous one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A dangerous one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you got your weed on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you grew, well, you've grown in both
Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were in Washington for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the most opposite places on
the whole planet as far as cultivation is
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about super dry Colorado
versus super humid Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 22 miles from the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, man, fog rolled in every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big learning curve there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, again, that's when I really
started to figure out the microbiology
[SPEAKER_02]: behind things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep the trichoderma pumping,
you're going to keep a lot of those
[SPEAKER_02]: problems away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought some strains up from Colorado
that were hitters, like this old purple
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that like the Oregon diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the purple phenos of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my experience, it came out of a
dispensary in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when we were sourcing plants in
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember purple diesel from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it performed really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the yield was really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we took that strain to Washington
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we set up a little R&D medical
greenhouse, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember putting 22 of these plants
out and seeing a little bit of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, we're all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll carve that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day, you could walk up and just
slop the whole thing on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, OK, we got to learn a lot
about how to move this air around and dry
[SPEAKER_02]: this air out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Struggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like field testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that works good in Colorado does
not necessarily work in Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing proper field testing and being
able to identify what works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so different than indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't really always understand how
much different and how plants respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have the same exact cultivar in
Washington or in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get a different
expression of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of that's UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Altitude is a big thing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Boulder, Colorado, we're kind of
sitting similar to a Hindu Kush Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a high desert, very arid,
cold weather, cold nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these plants want to stay close to
the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to spread their feet out versus
some of these tropical varieties that want
[SPEAKER_02]: to shoot up a pole to outcompete anything
that might be near them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've got a kind of a narrow
rootstock that doesn't go out too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you can pack them in tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all these different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think about like
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, OK, now you kind of got
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're throwing in all that
humidity and that heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you already have like natural
fungus blowing around in that wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's tons of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go further south.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I mean, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they grow great in the south,
but they also get tons of pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go to Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now you're growing in a swamp,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, indoor versus anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nothing against a good indoor grower,
you know, because, I mean, it takes the
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes and it takes the effort, whatever
you're doing, to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's passion involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to, every once in a while,
get lucky in a small home grower to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to produce good flour at
scale, it takes a special eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter whether it's outdoor
at scale or indoor at scale or whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's learning curves to all of it
and being able to move past the tough
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody, you know, everybody likes
doing anything the first time when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fun and it looks good, you know,
it's like, oh man, we've got this brand
[SPEAKER_02]: new facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to crank out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see who we can hit, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you got to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to keep showing up, you know,
and you can't get comfortable with what
[SPEAKER_02]: you think you're doing because eventually
you're going to fall off of your own path.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it takes almost somebody
else to be like, Hey man, let's bring it
[SPEAKER_02]: back this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's very much like,
you got to be your own cheerleader.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be a lot of life though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, that's like, you got to be
your own cheerleader in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's a great example of,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and motivating other people to
be there with you, you know, you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, man, like you got a thousand
plants to take down a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we don't stop at 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I used to sleep a lot less
and now I'm forcing myself to sleep more,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, it's like, as we've gotten
older, it's like I, when I was in my
[SPEAKER_01]: thirties, I'm like, I only need four
hours, five hours of sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, stay in party.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was younger, I was different,
but then I went through this phase where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't need a lot of sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it, but like I value sleep now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like for, for health,
for health, for health, I value sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's like, and then being as
productive as possible during the days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my wife for giving me that right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she's like, dude, you need,
to get that morning sleep, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause as a farmer, the past,
what Henry's 11, I've been doing it longer
[SPEAKER_02]: than that, you know, for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, man, we're up at five o'clock,
four 30, five o'clock, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the field by six in the greenhouse by
six 37 o'clock, but I mean, it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to be out of there by like two
30, you're still going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just going to have a life,
but life starts early and then you take
[SPEAKER_02]: all that stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then years and years and years and
years of that compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, you know,
I don't know, some days I'm going down the
[SPEAKER_02]: stairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like an old uncooked spaghetti
noodle and crack, crack, crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I know the feeling,
but it's interesting with cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than, not that it's better
than cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different than cooking, being a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's a whole different sort of
toll that that takes on your body too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and different kinds of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different stresses now about
plants rather than food, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all those things are character
building for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't trade a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like being a chef taught me, yeah,
it put my like, this is how you become a
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you stay a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, these are the things
you're going to focus or you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to face and focus on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't, then you're not going to
be a chef very long or you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a top, you know, a head chef very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think if you want to be a chef
or if you want to be a girl, the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is realizing where you're really at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's like, cause you can
improve if you know that you can improve,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think you've got it all figured
out, that's when you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you failed to a degree because there's
always improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always room for improvement and
going through life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, whether you're a chef,
like being able to take a step back and
[SPEAKER_01]: get rid of the ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's ties into the mushrooms
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even like, I mean, being able to get rid
of your ego and realize who you are and
[SPEAKER_01]: authenticity is such a big thing now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've gotten older, it's like,
I think being authentic is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that I worked with a lot of
egotistical maniacs in the culinary world,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then I got into cannabis, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that cannabis is a whole nother,
like, and I think there's like the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: rock star side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the funny thing is like, as funny as
like the whole rock star side of these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys and people wanting to be,
you know, pot celebrities or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going back to being tomato farmers
and you got to do it because you love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like the rock star image
that, you know, I mean, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis rock stars, you know,
it's like, look at, I mean, Arianne from
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, he's definitely like the
cannabis rock star lives up to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, a handful of other guys as well,
but we're going back into agriculture to a
[SPEAKER_01]: degree and farming and doing stuff because
you love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tomato farmers to a degree and maybe
not tomato farmers, but we're still,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like cannabis right now is going
through a, like culinary went through when
[SPEAKER_02]: the slow food movement started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, you know what,
dude, like you may think, you know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a tomato sauce, but like where are
your tomatoes coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's go all the way back down to the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes are important in the culinary,
but quality tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, there's such a, a difference
in a wide variety of tomatoes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the tomatoes and how,
how impactful that is to food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes across the board with all
the vegetables that are, that are
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think a lot of times we
only see one or two expressions of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the store, but like with potatoes,
there's thousands, thousands, thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: different cultivars of potatoes or
varieties of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost think this is the gift that
cannabis is going to give us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to teach a bunch of people how
to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to get the tools
and then they're going to use those tools
[SPEAKER_02]: to go grow Dahlia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to go, you know,
like go geek out on something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one more of her gifts,
you know, she's going to educate you to
[SPEAKER_02]: the point where you're like, why am I not
growing celery or, you know, what can I do
[SPEAKER_02]: in my backyard?
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you're following,
you know, all these like build a soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can, you do living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about, yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's a low tail living soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say it's no till cause I do top
dress and scratch and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, if, if a situation's bad
enough, I will dig up some soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, this year, my outdoor crop,
I have it's six year living soil from
[SPEAKER_02]: build a soil in my backyard, 200 gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put out 21 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have 24 kept it a little under
just keep them off the, off my back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but dude, it was water only.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, I was, I was kind of,
I was kind of putting it all the,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hanging like a bat right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I cut down the last day record
yesterday before I got on the plane.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in it, I mean, but yeah, so that same
thing I can throw like I did on that three
[SPEAKER_02]: sisters technique this year where you're
growing corn, melons and beans together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same soil, no fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was that called complimentary
planting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're using the corn to grow tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beans will grow up the corn and then
the melon will ground cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the beans are also nitrogen fixing the
soil for the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, yeah, it's just, it's really
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything came out awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, we've got a couple of fun
little pumpkins to play around with for
[SPEAKER_02]: Halloween and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I had way too many green beans this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green beans are awesome though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green beans are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing my kid will definitely
chow down on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dude, I love vegetables.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like you said about tomatoes,
I just, every, every spring I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, I need one of these tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need five of these different peppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I got a little geeked out
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the tomato farmers out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing it guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the farmers, all the farmers,
they all need a big pat on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Including the cannabis ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, but anybody who's still doing it,
whether it's, you know, agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, whatever, man, the fact is,
is times are tough and we're going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it through this just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always going to be a need for
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the more awareness there is
about quality, the more we're seeing it
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis, Colorado is a more mature
market and Washington is a more mature
[SPEAKER_01]: market than California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like in Colorado brands have
become established and they're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: off the hype as much as they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brands and brand awareness is a bigger
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the THC percentage, that stuff's all
going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about aroma and
other things and effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, it's now, it's definite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have your bargain shoppers who,
you know, that's kind of the dude that
[SPEAKER_02]: buys the mountain thunder instead of
buying Mountain Dew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes to Walmart and buys the knockoff
soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's plenty of that weed out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's plenty of what,
you know, people are calling mids or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's salty weed that is not
that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the brands that are doing really good
and the brands that can sell their pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of weed or their extracts are all about
quality and they're breeding their own
[SPEAKER_02]: in-house cultivars that nobody else has.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it separates them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're separating themselves through the
technique or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mass appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like for the back of the Westward
magazine, you know, like if you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for a $50 pounds, it's out there probably
even cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I saw $10 ounces in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like advertised, but you know,
like green dot, like that, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, green dot Dave, that guy like
constantly raising the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time they make a drop, the bar is
raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you heard of NorCal Nemo?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So NorCal Nemo sells the $1,800 ounces of
Skittles and thousand dollar ounces of
[SPEAKER_01]: Guava gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and the stuff is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like organic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's super terpy, super
flavorful, good effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I love those stories and some
people are like, oh, that's not worth it,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love hearing stories about somebody
succeeding like that on that level,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if they're true, because it
adds the, it increases the value of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else is doing it quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause at a certain point when we're
talking about the most amazing stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: we like to smoke and that that's the
highest quality that A triple plus stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that has flavor and effect and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all a subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like art.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like tattoos, tattoos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can go get scratched on by
some guy down on main street for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 20 bucks or you can,
you know, pay a thousand dollars for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple hours from your favorite artists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go to Japan, get hammered on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go somewhere and get a whole different
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, yeah, it's wild,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cannabis, there's, I don't feel
like anybody should feel like their ship
[SPEAKER_02]: has left the harbor or whatever the saying
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's plenty of room at the table
for everybody, but you do need to pull up
[SPEAKER_02]: your own seat and you do need to be
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, yeah, like pick a reason to do
it, but do it for a good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Passion should drive you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, so this is one thing I know we
can agree on is that passion should drive
[SPEAKER_01]: you in everything in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like being a chef, you really get
that like passion driven because you
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't work those long hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do those shitty days that,
you know, there's good days to come along
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, but there's shitty days too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you wouldn't suck it all up if you
didn't love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like as we get older,
it's like, there's other ways to make
[SPEAKER_01]: money too, but it's like being able to be
in cannabis and to be able to contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: to something that's so much bigger than
us, I feel like is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an amazing opportunity that we're
blessed to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is like, you know, it taught me
how to feed myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've helped, I don't even know how
many people with different problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, I mean, my brother-in-law
had stage four glioblastoma and got six
[SPEAKER_02]: months to live and CBD, man, like huge fat
syringes of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a game.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing, he's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it saves lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It saves lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the biggest thing is,
is like, it saves lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings us together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't be here today without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't be having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would've walked right past you if I
never, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's such a big part of my life,
big part of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the people that watch the
show, it's just such a special plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: special on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, it's definitely
part of everything that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's sometimes it's the reason I
can't go on that super long vacation I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to go on with my wife and my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a lot of sacrifice,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had plants I've had longer than my
son, you know, like I've kept a little
[SPEAKER_02]: plant longer than I've had my son,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such, it presents so many
opportunities in this, in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you put in, you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of things you can
say about that in life, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because relationships are another one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what, what comes out is what you
put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it should, but you learn real
quick with relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: With relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start coasting, you take your foot off
the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start coasting and things start
getting real swervy, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you got to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well with relationships, until it gets
tough, you really don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship or the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you go through tough times that
that's when you really see who people are
[SPEAKER_01]: and what people are made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's there for you and who's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and it's important to go
through those things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Struggle is, it's like, I wanted to run
away from struggle as a kid, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I thought the struggle was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to like live a comfortable life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And comfort isn't what life's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause as I've gotten older, I feel like
struggle is what makes you great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's also what makes life great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like experiencing struggle and to be able
to make it past that and growing and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to grow a plant and experience those
types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, dogs are another,
you're a big dog guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost three months ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like my, my best friend in the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best hellos and the worst goodbye,
man, like dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a whole nother level, dude,
but senior dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a new appreciation for senior dogs,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought the puppy stage is like
the best part until we had a senior dog
[SPEAKER_01]: that like the senior years were the best
where she wanted to be with us all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dogs are so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once you bring them into your life,
they're like, okay, I got one,
[SPEAKER_02]: one job and it's to hang with this guy,
you know, and make sure he's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I have a 130 pound Rottweiler
and the big head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all he wants to do is hang out with my
son or by the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his job.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he was named after one of the
best country music singers of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sturgill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sturgill Simpson, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I fell in love with Sturgill Simpson
and you turned me on to Sturgill Simpson
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day, a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope his voice gets better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently he's got some voice issues or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went from like this amazing country
to do an amazing bluegrass too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two albums are just next level,
but all his stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's another passionate guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I liked about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like kind of like that old
seventies hillbilly talking about weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's talking about like DMT and
turtles and, you know, like turtles all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way down and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, yeah, that definitely,
yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sturgill is the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I love all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, big Sturg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it'd be a good name for a big
old goofy Rottweiler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because like his music is kind
of in line with the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's some alignment there with
the message.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's also, yeah,
it's, it's just music is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This vibration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to catch those last dead shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last, oh dude, I stayed 20 minutes
from the, I was 20 feet, not 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like 20 minutes, but 20 feet from
the stage, uh, all three nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't go to the restroom during
intermission, any of those nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only night I had to go to the
bathroom was the third night at
[SPEAKER_01]: intermission.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sucked it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that guy's IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just like working out every time he
goes to swing and shit around his head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got, yeah, he's got some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, I mean, he, he's inspirational,
especially for moving into the older years
[SPEAKER_01]: of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like going to the X stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, that's going to be okay
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was a kid, I thought 40 year
olds were old.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was 18, I was like, man,
that dude's hella old and he's like 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, you know, like now that I'm
past 40, it's like, I don't feel all that
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important now,
cause you know, you're a healthy guy and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're focused on your health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am similar to, you know,
I take a lot of supplements and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but I'm 47 now, like, but I'm not
going to be 47 here in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really important to start
thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, man, like here comes 55 and
what's that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause I got a man, I got an 11
and a half year old.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's almost 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it's not all like it used
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do what you want to do for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right now I got people to look
out for and there's a bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sturge to feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sturge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the dogs though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to stick around for as long as
possible, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a reason I don't do hard
drugs or smoke cigarettes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked you a question, but I didn't get
the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What your favorite thing to smoke was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to say my desert Island
strain would be dog walker OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was just going to sit on,
you know, if I had just to enjoy,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to be high and not focus on anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could only smoke for the rest of your
life while you lived on that desert
[SPEAKER_01]: Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would, you know, it'd make me
paranoid enough to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would get me stoned enough to go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like those tolerant free strands
to where like, there's no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's the tolerance free where like,
it doesn't matter how long you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't fully build a tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, or even in the evening after you've
been smoking all day for, for like three
[SPEAKER_01]: months of the like green crack after a
week, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say chem 91, but it's just
like, if you even like look at that plan
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong, it's going to turn out different
than it did the time before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, she takes a lot of effort and a
lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I think my, yeah,
my go-to is that dog walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can grow her big and strong and
yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the concentrates are great from
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, she's a head, head wringer,
man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the TK, the lime green TK is fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought some TK for you to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love TK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a motor breath, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like all those chems and
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grateful dead weed, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the grateful dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all this stuff is nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The music, but then all these experiences
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I think it's cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where you grew up, you know,
like these New York cats are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's idle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the sour bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, it is about the sour,
you know, it is, but it's also about
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it fits, it fits the electricity in
New York city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like that kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can like flow through the city
with, you know, we're going to smoke some
[SPEAKER_01]: good sour in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had, or if you had the
opportunity to go back and talk to your
[SPEAKER_01]: younger self that had been in the industry
for just about a year, what would you tell
[SPEAKER_01]: your younger self?
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one would be get rid of the chef
ego day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like that was out of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to like, it was just like a
kitchen and I was trying to climb up the
[SPEAKER_02]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, if you're in my way,
I was a little rough, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I think I would have been a
little bit more Kumbaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think I did a good job on keeping my
eyes and my ears open, but I would now
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the research there is like,
especially with the socials and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Patreons and all that I would,
I would dive deep into.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what Brandon Russ is talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, he's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just listened to him on a first
book the day, the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I mean, yeah, those kinds of
dudes, there's like so much knowledge to
[SPEAKER_02]: gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want to run when he's
self-taught, that's the beauty of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, if you don't want to go
to school, you don't have to go to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, just it's all about reverse
engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you really love, you know,
like if it's like, dude, I love mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: biking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, don't, not go to college
because you want to ride your mountain
[SPEAKER_02]: bike, go work at a bike shop or go get
sponsored or, you know, like start getting
[SPEAKER_01]: some coins from something you love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't start early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, you know, like I've learned to
reinvent myself over the years with doing
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has always kind of been a
constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always smoked, you know, so,
but as far as like I've worked in IT,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done all kinds of different stuff,
worked as a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and also had a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when shit goes sideways, I can,
you have to pivot, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: in this, like this day and age,
you can, like back, you know, back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, it was kind of like you picked a
career and you had to stick with that
[SPEAKER_02]: career or, you know, change to a really
other boring career.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for, since the beginning of time,
you did what your father did, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's some beauty in that as
well as like perfecting something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I like, I've liked to try to do
everything and, you know, I've liked to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience different things, find out what
I like, but there is a beauty to doing one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that you love your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your whole life and mastering that to the
next level where you are in the very elite
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and that stuff takes time,
but also it can be a combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that lead you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the plans led me to understanding
soil and, and, you know, vegetables and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that would be my, my gift to my
son would be like, Hey man, like I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember when Henry was, I think about
four years old, his, his nephew was in
[SPEAKER_02]: town or my nephew was in town,
the kids like 11 years old and Henry's in
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden, like pulling things out and
showing this kid, like, this is how
[SPEAKER_02]: carrots grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the guy's like carrot,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I thought he, they came
inside and the kid was like, I thought all
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff just came from the grocery
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my little kid is showing you what's
underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like he knew what the leaf
looked like to pull the carrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he didn't get to see a carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, like, yeah, I think that's the
gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's going to be really amazing to
see what the kids of these, like your kids
[SPEAKER_01]: and my friends kids, I don't have kids,
but these kids and the things that they
[SPEAKER_01]: do, my nieces and nephews, like the things
that they're doing and the things that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as, as young adults,
and then as your kid is, he's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow up in a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, and all of it is
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything in life is beautiful from
the right angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not everything, but you know,
a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's the good, the good and
the dark, but a lot of stuff that we think
[SPEAKER_01]: is bad is necessarily not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my kid has kind of like a bad taste
in his mouth about America right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's like, why do, why is,
why is all this crap going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually went to Europe over like
after Christmas break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he got to see both sides and he's
still like, all right, when we move to
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, you know, which I mean with
cannabis now, Barcelona, I was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, the food is good over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's the one I was going to go the
year everybody got COVID and you had to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend a little extra time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, I definitely need to get
over there and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fun trip for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's looking to find out more
information about you, they want to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, where would they go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep my Facebook stuff kind of at
this point, like, if I don't know you,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably not adding you to my Facebook
is private.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Facebook's kind of turned into like
family stuff and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, at Brooksies buds, a B R O O K S
I E buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that'll kind of show you what I'm up
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's pretty much it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm kind of that edge of the
generations that like, I'm a private
[SPEAKER_02]: person, you know, like I don't have to
show off everything all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do want to get caught up on,
you know, Patreon and discords and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even some Reddit stuff and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be selling your seeds in
the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of people interested
in the breeding that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have one ready to go right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're calling it make America great
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's basically we reversed our
favorite grape drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a strain in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, it tastes like the purple
barrel grape drink from Walmart,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I got that on Gary and I got that on
all the currents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, they're FEMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be an easy, you know,
an easy thing to release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm already moving past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, I would like to get that one
out there and a couple others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't really bring up our friend
Leland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leland introduced me to Leland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Leland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really appreciate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's doing some cool breeding
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure Leland will send you some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He appreciates good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He appreciates the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to Leland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we got to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were supposed to bring a hat for me
from Leland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me, he gave me three jars of weed
that were grown with front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got nervous at the last minute going
through TSA and I left him at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, but no, he never gave me
any swag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he said, he's got swag for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Front row hooked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have those dope work shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the new, um, slick work shirts,
like the ag shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They crushed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not set on just one nutrient line as
far as for salts, but I think they do a
[SPEAKER_01]: good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a handful of other guys
that do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I just, I just really liked
the, the fact that the people that work
[SPEAKER_01]: there give a shit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know about the plant and about
making the plant the best expression it
[SPEAKER_01]: can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their customer service is really good
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was going to say,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're real like heads grow in the
plants that they're, they spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money to put people out there in your grow
to figure out what's going on and how they
[SPEAKER_02]: can fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, if it's a problem with their
product, which they did have a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: run-ins in the beginning, like everybody
does their part B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a micronization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a hammer mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like literally a hammer mill that
was screwing up the whole thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty well, but it's still a good,
yeah, they fixed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in these, yeah, that's what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now everybody I put on front row,
like I still got a bunch of homies in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado that are just home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Oh man, you know,
living soil is fine, but keep the dirty
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt outside, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put them on front row and they're
just like, dude, like so impressed and
[SPEAKER_02]: their plants look amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they smoke really well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hate on front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my buddy, Stacey up at Harvest House
in Netherlands has been growing the front
[SPEAKER_02]: row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got some Gary Payton and some
Alpine guava from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually got a 72 year old mom
helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to OG, old grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, she's grown some fire with the
front row, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff grows great weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's really, it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy to use.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's one of the easier
nutrient lines to actually use and execute
[SPEAKER_01]: flawlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel, yeah, it's kind of like,
you just got to know how to make some
[SPEAKER_02]: really good Kool-Aid and you're there,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use it in line too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Leland, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I got to work with Leland over
at a spot and I met him in Boulder at a,
[SPEAKER_02]: at a, at Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he used to breed lizards and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this guy, I mean, he's, there's so
much to Leland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's actually my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just bought a house right next to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, man, it's been great having you on
the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on and we'll have to do
this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy your time in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me out,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, the compound, holy smokes,
dude, like mind blown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is, it's already put
together, but I can, I can see what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen here very shortly and
couldn't be more proud of you,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
