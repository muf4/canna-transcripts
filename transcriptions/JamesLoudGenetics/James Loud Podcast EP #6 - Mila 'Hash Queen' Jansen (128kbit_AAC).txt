[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today my special guest is Mila Jansen,
one of my good friends from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so very well, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've spent the last week here in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it been?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's been wonderful and I've seen some
amazing places, met some wonderful people
[SPEAKER_02]: and had some great food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't die this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost died.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time we had a safe journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mila and I in 2014 almost died in a boat
accident on the bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good friend who's since passed,
Gordon Jones, he was the captain of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sailboat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were on a 35 foot sailboat and there
was only two boats out on the bay and the
[SPEAKER_01]: wind picked up and somehow we went for a
head on and ended up almost crashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so lucky because all those boats
have all these pieces of wood sticking out
[SPEAKER_02]: in all directions and all these ropes
waving around in that wind and nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were lucky that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were so lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some really good food afterwards
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: To celebrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mila's in town to accept a Lifetime
Achievement Award from the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's done a lot for the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been a part of the community over
the years and she's been a big part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of cannabis as it is in modern
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your contributions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be getting thanked a lot more
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot of selfies and a
lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to the beginning and I guess
we can talk about the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and hash and how you got started
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got started with cannabis in 1964 in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time there were no coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no weed to be found anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you went down to the harbor there'd
be pubs that had been buying hash from
[SPEAKER_02]: sailors and you could get it from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually the same way as I do now with a
little bit of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 58 years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started smoking hash and that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later I traveled east and I saw
several countries that are famous for
[SPEAKER_02]: their hash like Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew it was out there and in all
those countries they only smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody smokes weed at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the whole duration I was there I
smoked hash, came back to Amsterdam 18
[SPEAKER_02]: years later, full of coffee shops,
full of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried about three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after 20 years of hash smoking it
didn't serve me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hash extraction in the 60s and even
before then, there's several ways they
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing it around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about resin crystals that
are on the plant and they're extracted
[SPEAKER_01]: either using a sieving method like dry
sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry sift or for a screen or there's areas
where they rub the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the charas?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the charas and then scrape it
off their hand palms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd seen all this happening out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I felt I was just a recreational
smoker.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've had some adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've written an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about that thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take about two years to read,
but it's really amazing and there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: really good stories in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took me 11 years to write it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how was it like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan, the different hashes,
I mean, they bred specifically for those
[SPEAKER_01]: hash varieties that they had in
Afghanistan and Pakistan and other places
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For hundreds of years, if not longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think they cared much about
what it looks, smelt or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: so long as it made good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the circumstances in Afghanistan,
for instance, are quite wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard of one village that they just get
a big rainstorm once a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody runs out, plants the seeds and
that's all the water it gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know from experience that the
cannabis plant can create deep roots if it
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six meters, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 feet or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they get one rain a year and then
they all got to rush out to get everything
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how about hiking through the
Himalayas?
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw wild cannabis growing,
feral cannabis that was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenously?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that in the Himalayas, but the
place to go for that is Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 1,200,000 hectares of wild
marijuana growing there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So several different kinds that are
regional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't be surprised if originally
it was very good smokable cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that time Kazakhstan belonged to
Russia and I think Stalin saw how China
[SPEAKER_02]: made all these glows for everybody in
China out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he must have thought,
oh, I got a big hemp field or marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: field and he probably planted hemp among
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time I got there, the THC wasn't
exciting and there was quite a lot of CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how did it look?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't have like the structure that
we know now, it was more bushy or were
[SPEAKER_01]: they taller?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were taller and basically there was a
red stemmed variety and a green stemmed
[SPEAKER_02]: variety and they were either really the
one or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no like mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so people that smoked hash,
did they use those for hash at all or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just grown wild as almost an
ornamental?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just grow wild like other places
have pampas grass growing wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cultivated in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time I was there, it wasn't
illegal to have and smoke hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it didn't look very popular even among
the young people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't meet many people that smoked
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of all the countries you've been,
who smokes the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who smokes the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who smokes the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be surprised if it's America
and that's also because they dab and it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes a lot of flour to make a good dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so you've been doing the dabadoo for
over 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an event where it's judged on extract
and you have some categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a dry safe category, ice water
hash, rosin extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically a snow weed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always felt there's enough cups that
have weed that might be something
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I never smoke weed anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: To avoid it completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to a heritage hash company and
so the heritage, they have a dispensary up
[SPEAKER_01]: there and it's Bell's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy's Apprentice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do really good work and they gave us
some samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they won with the White Horn Rose at
Emerald Cup last year in the solventless
[SPEAKER_01]: extract category for the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really exciting to see how it's
progressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel how it's progressed from
the time you first saw hash to where it is
[SPEAKER_01]: now with things like rosin where they're
actually making bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has definitely advanced a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I started making hash,
we didn't even never even heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanted to make something get you
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the knowledge also of people has
increased a hell of a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People throw around language that is
nearly abracadabra to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have a lot more knowledge about what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more technological
advancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science of it's gone through the roof.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good thing because
anything, if it doesn't grow, it dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if making hash grows, that makes me
very happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to use my method,
but the fact that it's growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's caught on, it's become part of
many people's lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, as far as I know, hash is the
essence of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were a part of all this technology
actually with the pollinator.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the pollinator has been around
for nearly almost 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a dry tumbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first dry tumbler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when I came back to Holland,
I was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided to make my own hash and then
started real Afghan style on a flat screen
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of waffling the material around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until one night I stood quite stoned in
front of my clothes dryer, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: clothes dry and they're all tumbling
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was in one moment that changed my
life because I thought, how about making a
[SPEAKER_02]: flat screen round?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first mechanical system
to separate the dry combs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people have been doing it by hand
for longest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been selling them all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the technology is just
stacked over the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grown exponentially since,
especially since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like before the nineties,
it was, you know, they were doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in the seventies even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I remember I bought a book in
Berkeley off telegraph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue that was, you know, they had a
reflux apparatus and stuff to make,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, honey oil and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a hash back in the day,
the hash extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they understood it a little bit,
but then really, you know, Kenny Morrow
[SPEAKER_01]: and people like Kenny from dry comb
technologies have really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with butane extraction and everything else
that he's done, like it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's amazing where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quality, I mean, it's just,
I liked bubble hash back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: In early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now we have this rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in these hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of this modern stuff, I find too
strong for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like smoking a whole spliff in one
talk, like with the diving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at hash,
you want to smoke, what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: qualifiers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you put in order?
[SPEAKER_01]: Effect is the most important?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the effect is the most important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor, also the consistency.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it when you can crumble it still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made some hash three years ago that
when you came here, I gave you my,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you ended up really liking the three
year old hash, which it's been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like it's been sitting out for
three years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it very much because it's so
smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been coughing so much less since I've
been smoking that hash of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had so much of it at one point and I
gave a whole bunch of it away and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: saved the best of it and I've kept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I kept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I held onto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we have some different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got these hash holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hash holes are a new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're not super new.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been putting hash in joints
forever, but the hash holes are where you
[SPEAKER_01]: put, they call them donuts or hash holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam from Rosentick gave me and Mila gave
us some hash holes in a box set and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have the hash in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a stubby, but a glass tip and then
they put the hash in the middle and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they roll it around it and it burns like a
donut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually going to smoke this right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mila is going to smoke it with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it contains a lot of weed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains a lot of weed and they're
really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer, if I'm going to do a dab,
I'd like to do a dab or whatever for
[SPEAKER_01]: taking hits out of a vaporizer or anything
else like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my weed in joints and I like dabs
in rigs or something like that where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're separate and they have different
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like if I get used to smoking
joints all the time, my tolerance for dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: is very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then same thing if I go through
periods where I do lots of dabs,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I go to smoke a joint and all of a
sudden it gets me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why these dabs, the few times
that I've tried it have kind of knocked me
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Amsterdam, I spent a lot of time in
Amsterdam over the last more than 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've gone to the markets together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've cooked and Mila's had me over and
we've spent a lot of good quality time
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam's just an amazing city.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been in Amsterdam for how many
years now since you came back?
[SPEAKER_02]: About since 88.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 12 and 23.
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 years, something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what do you like about Amsterdam
the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the thing I can get everywhere on
my bicycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still ride a half hour a day,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, about 30 minutes at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you live somewhere, you also know
where to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you come somewhere and you're just new,
you don't really know where to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that time, you know where to
have the cheese that you like or the
[SPEAKER_02]: asparagus or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know where all the good restaurants
are, where all the market is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go more to markets than to restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic market in Amsterdam is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mushrooms there, not saying that
the mushrooms here are bad, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing mushrooms here too, but like
really, really, really incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, many varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, that's just for eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get those other places,
but the organic market has the edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and they have a variety of really
good mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the Golden Chanterelle are my
favorite, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go as a kid to Austria and we
used to pick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan,
you spent a lot of time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you live in?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't really live in either
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on my way to India.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Afghanistan and Afghani Haish was my
definite most favorite in all the time I
[SPEAKER_02]: lived out in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like about it the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: The smooth taste and effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, very nice high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, probably now you have western
marijuana that will get you higher maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: than that one in that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for that time, it was the best by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you also did a lot of hiking in the
Himalayas and up through the those
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain ranges, and you'd hike 20 miles a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the hike, it would build up
to nearly 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we'd be walking for a few months
and your body just becomes a walking
[SPEAKER_02]: machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have no body fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how is that girls?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're really serious about
losing weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll toughen you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dabadoo, the first Dabadoo,
I helped you with the Dabadoo in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cooked for the Dabadoo in Nikatee and
Duggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put it on together and hopefully we'll
do another one next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be the 10 year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, sounds good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fun event.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've worked with Nick, Nikatee and
Duggie on other events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I visited a lot of Duggie's events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chalice for me was the most amazing events
with everything that was to be seen there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duggie is a special breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of those guys that when he tells
you he's going to do something,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might sound crazy, but then he goes and
does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of times it's over the top
and it's like, holy shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does what he says.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does what he says and he's very
innovative and not like anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very creative when things go wrong,
how to finally solve the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really good at problem
solving when you're putting on events like
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of events he puts on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he seems to reinvent himself pretty
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fearless.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely fearless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he did some music a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he released an album with
Chalice and with all his events and with
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitman Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I first met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at the High Times Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget where it was in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had this amazing smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a table made of glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like a hookah that like
four different.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To talk on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mouthpieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a beautiful piece of
glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turned out he'd just created a
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, I think, the best book I had
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the hand blown chess glass
pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quality was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that also about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes for quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes for quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He understands quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He appreciates quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this market, you have to have
quality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 10 years ago, you could get by on
volume as an individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think really, if you want to be
competitive in this market, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have good quality, whether it's hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, flour, genetics, all these
things play a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's important to have the
best quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting with good seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people who ask me tips for making
hash, I always say the first three ones
[SPEAKER_02]: are good genetics and good genetics and
good genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without that, you'll never make good hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the genetics, you can't get past
that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have viruses and furoids,
all these things that we're aware of,
[SPEAKER_01]: these pathogens that are affecting crops,
like heavily affecting crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with good genetics, if you have
those problems, you've got to start
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other tip I give is not be greedy
because everything you've collected more
[SPEAKER_02]: is what you didn't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many dabadoos have you done now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think about 36 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought it would happen like that
because it was just going to be a one-time
[SPEAKER_02]: affair.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to do it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my 69th birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, I got to do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody liked it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four months later, we had one in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just been going since.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last fall, I did a trip through South
America, stayed in eight countries and had
[SPEAKER_02]: seven dabadoos actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really liked it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had glassblowers that would follow us
along for three or four dabadoos or other
[SPEAKER_02]: people you'd meet in Uruguay that had come
from Colombia or Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started in Brazil, Uruguay,
Argentina, Chile, Peru, Mexico,
[SPEAKER_02]: Costa Rica, and we ended in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had my dabadoo there on the beach at
my birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People in South America are very
passionate about extract and flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis in general, but like
embodying the whole lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I was there three years earlier
to have some dabadoos and the quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount and the interest has increased
so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really impressed me is the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in Mexico, where I think coming from
America, Mexico was like, oh, that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the shitty weed comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going there a year and a half ago,
it opened my eyes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality has gotten a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing in genetics from the
United States, good or bad, but they have
[SPEAKER_01]: some really amazing blends of some Mexican
stuff that I've seen and some Oaxacan
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the good stuff came from Mexico
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people don't give enough credit to
the genetics that have come out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: area, Colombia, Santa Marta, all these
amazing genetics that we're using even
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Mexico and South America and
the passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanish people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have passionate people all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing how passionate people
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really had such a good time there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes like a magical mystery too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had no idea where you'd be sleeping
the next night, but I was okay too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always an adventure.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the dabadoo, you typically get like
20 to 50 entries?
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally we get between maybe 18 and 25,
going up to 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 max, except for in Chile where there
were 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he'd gotten permission to add wheat to
his things, but that was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a wonderful dabadoo out in the
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabadoo out in nature sounds fun.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been to Italy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gone to Italy at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to Italy, but not with the
dabadoo yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did one of our...
[SPEAKER_02]: I was taking part in the cannabis cycle
tour to raise money for medical purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them ended in Italy.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Italians love their hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like my Italian friends love hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people love hash all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just really isolate one,
but my friends that are Italian,
[SPEAKER_01]: they like hash more than wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly once you get to Turkey and East
of that, I don't know, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Southern regions, you'd find some wheat
like in Thailand or India even,
[SPEAKER_02]: but all the way from Turkey to China,
they smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, China.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have people that smoke hash in
China.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super illegal there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to a couple of pollinators
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to the factory that's going to
copy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's happened before too,
I think, with everything and with
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hash hole tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes hash holes... It's actually
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably the perfect point of
tasting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we burned it down and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the good flavor from the hash and
yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't hurt my throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not affecting my... The high is nice
and clean from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the hash hole is more of a modern
name for it, but that's really trendy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big trendy thing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people make big hash holes where
they put like four grams of flour and do a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram of rosin or a gram of hash in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great for parties, but this has a
really nice oil ring around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's burning nice and even.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ash is white in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys can get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our good friend Soma is getting an
award for, I believe it's Breeders Hall of
[SPEAKER_01]: Fame for Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can't come to the States to get the
award, but... I'll bring it back for him
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's not too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and Soma is a good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone to dinner with Soma and Ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Ed will be by in a little bit,
but yeah, Ed's a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think we've had some crazy
conversations between the four of us in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam before at Golden Temple.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite restaurant is over there where
you just sit on the floor and... I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a home cooker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go much to restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I travel, there's no home
cooks unless I'm over at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly go into restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you like Barcelona as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of your favorite cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the city very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all the buildings, especially the
Gaudi buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the kind of general feel of the
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's active.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of very much alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're a pretty adventurous eater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all Dutch people are as adventurous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like sushi?
[SPEAKER_01]: You went to sushi the other night?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to enjoy some of the good food
in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's so much diverse food
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping into talking about the
achievements over the last 60,
[SPEAKER_01]: 70, 80 years of achievements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think being a woman, the biggest
achievement in my mind is your success
[SPEAKER_01]: being a woman at the time when you're a
woman in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a competitive market as it is,
but it's a man's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry, you had to be tough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my aunt who, she was in the
cannabis industry growing back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's another one and it's like,
it's a very competitive world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's very few women that actually
break through and be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that try it and
there's been women that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: successful, but you were one of the
pioneers of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you've shown a lot of people,
I believe that you were one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: that's shown a lot of the people in the
industry here in California, hash makers,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jendo, Mel, people like that, seeing you
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the biggest
things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the pollinator, I mean,
being able to do the pollinator and being
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still sell them and you've had your
money for 30 years almost, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at different locations and you've had a
lot of fun along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fun along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fun along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't start the business until I was
50.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really had a lot of fun and I'm very
glad actually it turned out like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I spent when I was younger,
being full time there for my children also
[SPEAKER_02]: and having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so tell us about your children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your daughter helps you out a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My oldest daughter, she helps me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does all my Instagram, all my media,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a son who's manager of my
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to learn all that, but he's doing
okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have another daughter and she's
an ecologist and she advises cities and
[SPEAKER_02]: towns with their parks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mainly with their bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does a lot of research about the bats
because they're protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have one more kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my youngest son.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was dyslexic like hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted him three times in first grade
and now he's a PhD and he's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, let me say this correctly,
a computational pharmaceutical chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just got his first patent for some
medicine for blood cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to tell him he could get a good
job with marijuana, but he likes to invent
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds and then knowing to which
receptors he goes, they go, he can works
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, anyway, that's how he tries to explain
it to his mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash hole hit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effects work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the States, when did you start
coming over for cannabis vents?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in the 2000 around 2010,
when they first started with that cup or
[SPEAKER_01]: did you travel around here before it all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember when I first came
here and a friend who used to work for
[SPEAKER_02]: high times, Annie Rican, and she wrote the
first article about the pollinator for
[SPEAKER_02]: high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jen wrote another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that was later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she started all Ash Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her article just had on one page,
Ash Queen, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Annie introduced the pollinator and it
was a few years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really, you know, when you get
older, your memory... Dates change,
[SPEAKER_02]: times, names change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a few years after I came out with
the pollinator.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mid 90s sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and you make different sizes with
the pollinator and you started out with
[SPEAKER_01]: the smaller size and then you got the big
commercial size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got one that's good for 11 pounds,
five kilos anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's about 11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're building a newer version of the
forever, but that's stagnating a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit, but we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the idea with forever,
like in the other ones, you throw the
[SPEAKER_02]: material inside the drum and it turns and
the forever is open ended at both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used to have another model before
and I sold them quite a lot to South
[SPEAKER_02]: America and I always said, as long as you
have someone to shovel, it'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just shoveled it in one end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes through and then comes out the other
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way you could put in two
positions and one would take about three
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes to get through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like a first quality and the
other 15 to 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in much slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he'd get more, but it was really more
commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot more plant material in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the temperature you're using
your machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people used to use dry ice in the
machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they still do that,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they would do that
because we tried one time, but then the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole screen gets wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trachomes don't fall through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do it in a cold room,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made bags for dry ice and we had some
demonstrations in one time at the high
[SPEAKER_02]: times when they were the last one they did
in Amsterdam.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, you know, the first 30
seconds to a minute, maybe it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just get the trachomes, but because
all the material is so cold, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaves are going to start breaking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after a minute for me, yeah,
maybe it's okay for butter or cooking,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not for smoking anymore.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when somebody asks you what your flavor
is, what are you usually your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one in my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all the other ones are past and
future, but they're up in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of grew up in the age when
they've here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I know, so it's so
difficult, especially if I'd come to the
[SPEAKER_02]: States, every time I come back,
there's at least a hundred new names.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it'd take me a whole year to
try them all, which one I'd like best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice how she said names because there's
a lot of renaming going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whether they're renaming or whether
the names come out of new crosses and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of new crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the style changes slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's impossible for me to really,
from all this, what's being grown and
[SPEAKER_02]: produced here to say which one for me is
the best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one for right now until there's
the next one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coffee shops in Amsterdam, you saw the
coffee shops evolve into what they are
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's changed because five years ago,
the red light was much bigger and there
[SPEAKER_01]: was more coffee shops closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But slowly over time, how many years did
it take to get where it was in its peak?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe between 91 and 94 was really
its peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a collection of newspaper headings
and all of them, the police support
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: All kind of in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody was expecting it to be legal
by 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we just vote wrong because even
after 40 years of coffee shops,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is tolerated to sell in the coffee
shops and they love to get their
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage of taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is illegal to grow for the coffee
shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just typical Dutch hypocrisy or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 40 years, they still don't see
any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although now they have this new government
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I heard about it, they're going
to grow four kinds of weed and one of them
[SPEAKER_02]: is CBD weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then supposedly in their idea,
all the coffee shop is going to sell that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine that that's going to work
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the diversity that the
coffee shops have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what makes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of them sell the same for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people aren't going to get excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nobody's going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they spent several millions on it
to get this up and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're still doing it because they're
able to grow legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some some truth to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the politics over there is so strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like every other year,
every couple of years, they talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: banning it or they talk about they're
going to expand on it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that expanding on it hasn't been
like that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the most recent new law is that you're
not allowed to walk through the Red Light
[SPEAKER_02]: District in Amsterdam anymore,
holding a spliff or anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's not the smokers that
create the noise and the fights and the
[SPEAKER_02]: yelling and the screaming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know that's the people are
drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say anything about any
English people that I know that like to
[SPEAKER_01]: drink a lot and get rowdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a few we've even made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam has even made ads to discard
British people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really good British friends.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But especially the younger ones are
notorious for being loud and rowdy and
[SPEAKER_01]: rowdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of rowdy, rowdy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2013 at the High Times Cannabis Cup
in Amsterdam, you were the only one
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops came in and raided the place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't do you remember what they were
yelling and the people when they were
[SPEAKER_01]: yelling pineapples?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pineapples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the stage suddenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly was looking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pineapples.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they all about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the distance, I saw the cops
walking up to the big aisle, the central
[SPEAKER_02]: aisle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they arrest the little lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing was that we were
demonstrating the isolator, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'd been demonstrating that isolator
more or less with the same material,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like that every new run was new
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just went on just for people to see
what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did have a couple of bags next to
it to change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was more than 500 grams,
they said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time I ever heard
that I was even allowed 500 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it took me with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them, yeah, that was just
crazy, because once they came in,
[SPEAKER_02]: it became clear that everybody who left
there would have to give up whatever they
[SPEAKER_02]: had in their pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd look towards the entrance and
there was this gigantic cloud coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was trying to smoke it before
they got to the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a big garbage can that everybody
was supposed to throw their stuff into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I believe Ariane is the one that
set your bear off.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bailed you out for that event,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem was that this location was
not inside the city of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to ask this kind of other town
for permission to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times probably didn't pay enough
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was that or if it was
just the wrong city where they didn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: what was going on in Amsterdam with all
the coffee shops and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the more bourgeois people living
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded good on paper until it
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was pretty wild, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people were really spooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took me to the police station,
but it didn't take more than three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could go home again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never, ever heard anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those high times events, the cups were
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Amsterdam ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like disco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could never do it quite the same
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met some friends that I, a lot of
friends that I'm still friends with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at those events from all over the world
and so, and seeing all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, seeing different hash, different
flour, hot sauce from my friend from
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinidad, you know, every, we ended up
getting hot sauce every year and Franco's
[SPEAKER_01]: left us, but he leaves behind his legacy
and he's very passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a very sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked him a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was actually the one when Ariane won
his umpteenth hash cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: He handed it to me, Franco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave you the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me the cup.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was quite the character.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I both gave the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I found out later that it wasn't
their cup to give away in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was quite the character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Franco was always so passionate about weed
and he could roll the biggest he rolled
[SPEAKER_01]: these joints that were this long.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always fun to be around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very, very loving kind guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked him a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, Frenchy and a couple
of weeks ago, they had this showing of
[SPEAKER_02]: this, I think it was called Frenchy dreams
of hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea was that all over the world,
people could watch the movie at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd all do a zoom together
after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was divided in different time
zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe was one time zone, North and South
America one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they had one in France too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Paris and in Germany, London.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had several people from Paris come
up to ours to watch it from Germany
[SPEAKER_02]: because they knew where in Amsterdam,
at least they could smoke while they were
[SPEAKER_02]: watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it in the cannabis college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was very nice because first we
were going to do it in a Pridami,
[SPEAKER_02]: the coffee shop there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but then he said it's the biggest,
most busy day and the most busy time,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven o'clock in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was imagining standing at the door
and there's 200 people trying to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to figure out the ones which
are coming to see the movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do it in cannabis college and we
just put out the message, bring stuff to
[SPEAKER_02]: share.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had so many edibles and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, it was a really nice party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the movie I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just great to hear him speak
towards the second half.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a lot of more of activists and
politicians talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured maybe it was worth two movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really sad about Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unexpected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was full of life up until his
last breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met for the, well, we didn't really
meet, but we were in Goa in the late
[SPEAKER_02]: seventies, mid seventies, late seventies
at the New Year's Eve party at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was like 25 years younger and a
bachelor and I was a mom with four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was a Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke French in the French gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were very separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nobody else speaks French.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we never really met like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us about Goa back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Goa has changed a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first year I was there is winter 68
and there was 11 travelers, 11 people were
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second year, 200, third year, 5,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just kept growing from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots of parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lifestyle too though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in the beginning there was no
electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only if you had someone along with
played a flute or a guitar or some
[SPEAKER_02]: tableaus or something, there'd be some
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember one time we got a candle
from the church.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we got it or bought it,
whatever, but it took all night to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sat around in the circle all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think many people said a word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a very strong experience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was what happened in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually when I first arrived there,
you got down there by the Bombay boat and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd land in Panjim and cross the river
in a canoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was these copper little
buses just big enough to hold 15,
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 people maybe that were driving around
at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just very magical, very good
for acid experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green is already so green.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sky is already so blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hibiscus flowers are already with
their red colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the food there, how's the food?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fish, especially in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now they hardly get any fish out
of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't go into the sea anymore because
now they have trawlers now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was just canoes from the
village and the fishermen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd go out at night and get very
drunk and fanny and come back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everybody helps to pull in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a big net in like a U shape and
two ends you pull it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd always used to help, especially
the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they could take as much fish
as you wanted if you'd help them pull in
the net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed so much over the last 40
years there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's become very commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything seems like everything's become
commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember as a kid being able to
drive up to Portland, Oregon from the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: Area and there would be different candy
and different sodas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different stores, small businesses really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it's gone, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we got to treasure the boutique
companies that we still have and the
[SPEAKER_01]: people even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since it's gone commercial, we've lost
some of the legacy brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry, it's not easy like
people would like it to be or think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I remember afterwards actually that
it quite isolated you from society because
[SPEAKER_02]: you could never talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you only had a certain set of
friends and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you'd have friends doing all
because people come together from all
[SPEAKER_01]: different kind of cultures that smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that was the one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was growing, there wasn't so much
people traveling to smoke pot yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I was aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't meet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it seems like it's the one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the glue that holds us
all together in some regards over a span
[SPEAKER_01]: of this even.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all go back and we do different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think spandibus is probably the
biggest event like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I must say the one in Chile was
also huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Ariel there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's in Thailand right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they just opened Greenhouse in
Thailand, I think, last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that sounds like the new promised
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting because their
market, I think, for tourism, it's great
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have so much tourism.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people from Asia will be able to go
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People from Europe that want to go to
someplace tropical, it's a great place to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like smoking pot, it's a great
tourist destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm excited to go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just in Tenerife.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the Champions Cup there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas first prize, you get a big boxing
belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to hand out the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, oh, because all the guys
were going like this with the belt before
[SPEAKER_02]: I could hardly get it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So heavy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they just have so many coffee
shops there and or clubs they call them
[SPEAKER_02]: there in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's obviously for the tourists.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder how that goes anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Spain in Barcelona,
especially for the social clubs that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look very much like the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer them to coffee shops and to
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, they haven't really thought of
anything else yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the vibe is all chill for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I like it because friends really agree
to meet up in their club, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then hang out together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not sure, but in dispensaries,
but in a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, maybe you'll have a coffee with a
friend, but it's not like in the club you
[SPEAKER_02]: hang out there for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go there, talk for a few hours,
a couple of joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drink a beer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because in a social club in that
setting, as far as the government's
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned, it's like it could be a chess
club.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even considered Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's its own private thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, totally different business
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I like clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis has gotten a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash has gotten better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the varieties and the
accessibility to stuff and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and nutrients and all these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market has matured over there
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really impressed with the stuff
that's in the shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if if I'm here in the States and
people, I tell them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Amsterdam, oh, I'm going to come
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a lucky girl?
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell them, if I was you, I'd go to
Barcelona now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's more variety, better
weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that the people aren't great in
Amsterdam, because I really like the
[SPEAKER_01]: people in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Amsterdam, it's also forbidden to
sell extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all paranoid to sell rosin,
even though technically, what I understand
[SPEAKER_02]: a little, that should be legal because it
has only been squashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, same as my hash things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you haven't involved a club in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooking process or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be any manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even edibles, you have to have an ugly
looking cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be marketed like it can't be
marketed towards kids, obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ugly cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think technically by law,
it's also not really allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some coffee shops have bubble
hash and they do have rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just call it isolator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Amsterdam has a good variety of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know where to go, you can get
really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, American, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to climb four stairs to get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a workout, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think before, yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, American genetics are so popular
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people consider those great
ones that were Dutch before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be like, OK, well, we know those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think a lot of the Dutch genetics
came originally from California,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, in California and South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we had some interesting
breeding going on in the 80s and 90s in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam and in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, but some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and now it's coming back in the States,
these haze hazes are coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never found any weed in the 80s,
did I?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you weren't looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when the city was full of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was before my time in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, really, really interesting in
the breeding projects that went on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, things like Super Lemon Haze and
Amnesia and Liberty Haze and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese is not necessarily from Amsterdam,
but very popular there, extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good hash strain and, you know,
and there are so many seed companies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you went big, they did a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of seed companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but not so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so many new ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last 10 years, maybe just a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: While in Spain, I remember from one year
to the next, you know, you kind of keep
[SPEAKER_02]: track of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were like so many 46 Spanish seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only 10 of them actually probably made
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest were just buying seeds from
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds wasn't my business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting, interesting market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and like each one of the seed
companies in Amsterdam, they all had their
[SPEAKER_01]: classic signature genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Luke from Paradise, he had his
Sensei Star, like that's his claim to
[SPEAKER_01]: fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Greenhouse, they had several
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the older companies, they really
had that one claim to fame, their
[SPEAKER_01]: flagship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the first one was White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was it's funny because I just I
don't know if you saw the White Widow that
[SPEAKER_01]: I had last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some White Widow flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the first time I've seen it since
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this stuff called the sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a phenotype of the White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was super, super, super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys in Richmond would grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this crew of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff was super expensive,
but it would make you sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had nothing to do with the genetic
sweating or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would make you sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally, you know, you would be
dripping sweat after you smoked it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really good White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the European stuff is very
kind of a vanilla White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see the really strong,
pungent smelling White Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_02]: He originally, I think, developed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then he made other ones also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was pre-Greenhouse,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the stories there maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stories, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we hear all kinds of different
stories for the origins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as we smoke a lot of weed
and get older, as things change,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there were so many seed companies
back in the 90s in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: In High Times magazine, we read about like
as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the 90s, I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first started smoking in 91,
but High Times magazine was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go in there for all the cannabis
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't go to the bookstore and buy
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get it on Telegraph Avenue in
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had these seashell pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy would make these seashell
pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like $10 or $15,
which was a lot of money at that time
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to like now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like still you didn't... And
you had the High Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had High Times and Ed Rosenthal
books, Jorge Cervantes books, Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had those three staples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wanted the books, you'd get
them on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Telegraph or on Telegraph.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go get some lunch, skateboard around
the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at that time, yeah, maybe some
books would be starting because once I
[SPEAKER_02]: started my shop, we started selling books.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, we had like 150 titles,
half of them about cannabis and half of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bound about psychedelics and mushrooms
and everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of good books out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good books that you can't
find here in the States that are only in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen them in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys have a lot more books,
it seems like, on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody buys books now because they'll get
their info from Google or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, next is ChatGP.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just talk into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ask the app what you want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually train it to do different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, it's... Yeah,
you can get it to write your essays and
[SPEAKER_02]: book reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, very soon, if you do,
the teachers are going to have a way where
[SPEAKER_01]: they can find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the moment, there's a big to do about
it because smart kids are using it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: teachers aren't aware of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just finding out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're doubtful of anybody's
writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about all this
technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think it's good?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when we were talking earlier about
nuclear, you were very against nuclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, mainly because they
haven't figured out what to do with the
[SPEAKER_02]: waste material.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think once they get that solved,
I do believe what I read and know about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, that it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you also have these terrible
accidents like... Oh, yeah, like
[SPEAKER_01]: Fukushima.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Russia that time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chernobyl and these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is clean energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it is clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting conversation for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as far as technology now,
I think...
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes totally beyond me because even my
phone, I don't know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that my phone gave up phoning a
couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you took a little break for a couple
of days from your cell phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get it to work as a phone anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can only do a Gmail and what's up
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dread the day that I really have to
get a hearing aid because I hear that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: on an app on Bluetooth also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything has an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is Bluetooth capable now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about dab rigs, lighters,
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rely on technology, maybe a little more
than we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's obviously the direction is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won't have to keep up for too many
more years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have my daughter there.
[SPEAKER_02]: She helps me so much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look back at the industry and all
the stuff you've done, what do you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: was your biggest contribution to the
industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the pollinator kind of got things
moving because that I think the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: that even had the thought I can make my
own hash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, before that, it never occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time I showed them at
one of the high times cops, I had several
[SPEAKER_02]: ladies coming over and they'd always
thought that hash came from like a
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even realize that it came from
the cannabis plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of not knowing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and not just because of it,
but yeah, just because it started things
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling and moving in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you were the beginning of all this
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't use it and don't understand it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a life of its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can see everybody's happy and
enthusiastic with what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and it's hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fully bless what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the world a better place,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell a little story,
one of the craziest occurrences on my
[SPEAKER_02]: trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, there's a couple,
but this is a nice little one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We arrived in Pakistan from Afghanistan
and it was a Sunday or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no banks open, so we had no
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of wandering around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was these two little
bicycle rickshaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were quite small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beautifully decorated with colors and
blinkers and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having nothing else to do, we followed
them and we ended up at this circus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only the owner, but everybody in
it was a little person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you call that correctly,
a lily putter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nobody was bigger than up to my
waist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the owner and he had his own tent
and he was made of silk and applique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sat inside like some Middle Eastern
rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had all these poofs there and his
hookah in front of him and with his
[SPEAKER_02]: enormous turban and beard, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He even had dancing girls, although what
they were wearing was quite hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: They must have heard about brows from the
West and bikinis and stuff or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they turned out is something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Madonna got it from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pointy bra.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we stayed there for three days and we
performed in the circus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my daughter, who was three then,
would sing Baa Baa Black Sheep and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody crooned and was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guys would dress up as bears and
have fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they thought that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what otherwise they had in
that circus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to dance rock and roll with some
of the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even the whole orchestra were these
small people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they played the bass standing on a
stool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a crazy situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked after us very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to get there was actually the first
time that I really smuggled some hash from
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan into Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd ended up traveling through
Afghanistan, finally to the Khyber Pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's apparently where trucks came
from India to stock up on hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as I heard or experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could get it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twenty dollars a kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with my last money, more or less,
I got two kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was traveling with six guys,
Western guys at that time, and everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: got some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we get closer to the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, I took all the hash and put
it in a big bag with some towels and kid
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sat in front seat with my daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the driver was very concerned if I was
enjoying it and was I OK and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get to the border and one of
the border guys comes over because Mellus
[SPEAKER_02]: and me, my daughter, we got invited to
eat, have tea with the officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The officer had never seen a little girl
with blue curls and blonde curls and blue
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had tea and I had cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, the whole bus was
getting searched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also very much the locals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they were supposed to be
bringing from Afghanistan to Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think stuff like rice or some vegetable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think hash was involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, finally, everybody piled back in
the bus and the officer himself carried my
[SPEAKER_02]: bag back and put it back in the bus and
continued.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us some more stories about
smuggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've got some good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I got we got talking about
Afghanistan when I arrived there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also something we arrived on the
bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bus didn't really want to ride all
the way to the border because he had a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole next lot of customers waiting like
six hours earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he dropped us about half a kilometer
away from the border, pointed up the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, that's the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was in the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got our luggage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you didn't carry more than or brav
more with you than you could carry in
[SPEAKER_02]: those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So took our luggage and walked up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're both kind of shapes in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either they were walking your way or the
opposite way or just standing still.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got up there and there were some tea
shops and they all had these kind of beds
[SPEAKER_02]: around where people sit on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eat and drink their food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly the border police or control come
over and they're carrying something with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's their hookah pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, they put their hookah pipe and fill it
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they show us how to smoke,
me especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just said, welcome to
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just such a magic moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very welcoming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ate everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was really a nice country in those
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always felt it was because we all loved
the hookah pipe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they grow in some really harsh
climates there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really harsh climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mila, tell me your story about the
American Book of Law.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time I ever had the American Book
of Law in my hands was when I bought it
[SPEAKER_02]: second hand on the market in Delhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a time when I used to send
back books sometimes with some hash in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this book of law, I don't know,
it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like a treasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to, well, I sent it to Holland and
he made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the feeling of having this book of law
for this very purpose of cutting it open
[SPEAKER_02]: and putting hash into it and shipping it
out with something special extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think, you know, even on a
higher level, like without doing things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and breaking the law and pushing
the limits, cannabis wouldn't be legal
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one of your legacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think not even probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people didn't do the illegal stuff and
break the law, it would not be legal
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know why it was legal in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think that started here in the
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, unfortunately.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I'm glad we're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I saw when I saw medical for the
first time in 96, I knew someday it would
[SPEAKER_01]: be legal in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize that it would happen like
it happened, but I knew that it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was excited for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: By that time, I'd been smoking so long and
never really considered to do medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was more like a ruse to
get in through the back door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since then, I've also changed my
opinion by myself and realize I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking the medical all those years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I never touch wood,
get very sick, very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was Dennis Perron that said
it's medical whether you believe it is or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's definitely a lot of truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so what other events are you doing
this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you plan on doing more dabadoos this
year or are you going to any other?
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, maybe I'm hoping to do some
dabadoos here right in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before that, I'll be in Berlin for the
full moon sesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very interested because online we
got connection with an Afghani person and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've even bought seeds from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last month or so, he got refugee
status in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave him a house and a job and a bank
account as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when this full moon sesh came on,
my daughter got it together and asked him
[SPEAKER_02]: and yes, he would love to judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually we're both judging dry sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very curious about his opinion of
what we think is worth entering as dry
[SPEAKER_02]: sift for a competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I was growing in Amsterdam,
an old Afghan friend came by one time and
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed him the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was hugely impressed by the size of
the buds because there, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd never ever had nutrients or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardly rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I said, yeah, I'm harvesting
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, about 10% of the crystals is
changing color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people who smoke weed think that's the
right time to harvest and get it ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I asked him, and I'm very glad I
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked him, I said, but you guys only
make hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when would you harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, in about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And alas, because we did all our growing
indoor, I could never find anyone who was
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared to pay the electricity bill to
have the grow go on for an extra two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: and not being certain that that would be
financially worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to end up with is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day I'm going to be able to hope to
try it and see what the different effect
[SPEAKER_02]: is then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely has a different effect,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine also it has maybe more CBD
in it than those kind of different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivar dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavors change completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people harvest it 63 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them should probably be harvested
56.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some should be harvested a little
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cultivar dependent,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is eight weeks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight weeks is 56 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could fill it in on the map ahead of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 56 days for a lot of stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then sour diesel, for instance,
that, in my opinion, needs to go a minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: of 70 days, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these OG varieties that we used to
grow, 70 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could even go 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had one variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came in from California in a bunch of
flowers as a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Orange Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we had Calio that was 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends grew it back in the day,
but 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a more sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very, very equatorial sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the pre-Tangy Bud that had
that tangerine orange flavor, a little
[SPEAKER_01]: rind in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect was good, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming out on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad to catch up with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was wonderful to spend some
time together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't go hiking in the Redwoods like
we wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we wanted to, but we'll do that
together one day, next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so when people want to find you
online or in Instagram, how can they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: hold of you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look at pollinator.nl, www
.pollinator.nl.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Instagram is milahashqueen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're off to New York after this
to go see Dougie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a taste of New York happening,
so hopefully we'll get some feedback from
[SPEAKER_01]: that event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for having me here on this
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for putting up with me for a
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been a great guest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've been a great host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a fantastic garden to unwind
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
