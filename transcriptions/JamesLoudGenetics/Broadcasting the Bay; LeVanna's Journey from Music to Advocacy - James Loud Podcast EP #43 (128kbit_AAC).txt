[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, our special guest is LaVonna from
the Bay Sesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a, you know, somewhat
short notice we met last week over at
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve D'Angelo's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were visiting Richard DeLisi when he
was in town and Small World, you have your
[SPEAKER_01]: own radio show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me on the
show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like what you do for the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following the show for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've, you know, you, I love the people
that you choose to have on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like an honor for you to include
me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a show on 89.5 FM, KZCT,
AusCat radio in Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Bay Sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing it for a little over five
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started it Thanksgiving of 2019.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time sure flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got offered the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing some, so I decided I wanted to
create a brand within cannabis when it
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could quickly see I didn't have the
resources to pull together for like
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I figured what I could do was build,
sort of start with like a lifestyle brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: NorCalFlower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was doing that for about a year
and I got offered this slot on the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually been a DJ since 1998
when I got my turntables down on Market
[SPEAKER_00]: Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't unfamiliar with that as well
as like having gone to film school and
[SPEAKER_00]: been in film and post-production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started DJing midnight till 2 AM for
about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started as houses of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would play like stony music and talk
to people in their cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are you out in your car smoking
weed, you know, late night or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kept doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some guests on and then it became
the Bay Sesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the like culture shifted into the
legalization, I saw a lot of my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: that were just like sort of stuck on the
hill, maybe didn't have a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like couldn't really promote
themselves so much on social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: content and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling left out while some other people
were sort of taking that place and feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to make my show about sort of
holding that space and like telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: stories of my friends from the culture,
from like the Bay to Humble, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And through music and growing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I found myself playing a
lot of Mendo boys, high grade all-stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started doing some videos too,
but like the core like foundation of it
[SPEAKER_00]: all is that show in Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's so much to culture
people haven't seen and it's great to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people like yourself being able to
share audiences, like they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they'll learn about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe you'll talk about me on
your show and people learn about our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like, you know, it's,
it's an amazing time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing time to be in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's changed and evolved so much in
the last, you know, 15 years, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not how exactly we imagined it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually living in Brooklyn right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that you knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still broadcasting the show and I'm in
the studio when I'm home visiting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going there on and off since
2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I home based it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just really wanted to see where
things went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day I was getting off the train
and there was like a taco truck next to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, a girl had an ambulance that was
like a mobile dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is what I thought it
was going to be like in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, lots changed in the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're finally like year five
into like recreational legalization here
[SPEAKER_00]: in California, turning a corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things are starting to kind
of like settle and like the OGs and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people, the, the real people from the
culture are finally getting their
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, they're stuff in the
dispensary or their dispensaries or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm glad to have like held the
torch for this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everybody's sort of getting there
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a long ways to go though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this stuff that's going on in the
industry, New York, and they're the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bodegas that are in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I feel like that's,
that's a whole interesting, I haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: out to New York to check it out,
but that's a very interesting scene out
[SPEAKER_01]: there from what I hear, very unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a relationship, there's always
been a relationship between us and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what is like the biggest
consumer market in the world and the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest, well, you know, was the biggest
supplier or grower cultivators of not just
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but food here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to change too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an obvious relationship there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but now, yeah, with their freedoms and
the way things are going, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like LA was right after, you know,
with the gray area there, but it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: three year long gray area and it's New
York city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much, much different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different energy out in New York than LA,
even though they're, they're both big
[SPEAKER_01]: cities and amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the United States, there's totally
two different energies and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: different, both, both great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like people from LA and I like people
from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they all have their intricacies and
yeah, it's, it's a lot of fun always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see people like
Buddy's Bodega opening up a shop in LA now
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the Astor Club opening up and
bringing what they've been doing there to
[SPEAKER_00]: the LA scene now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it could start in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a little more freedoms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a NorCal Bay area person and I
love it up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I would hope that we could
do like the Astor Club thing model is
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't have anywhere here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still getting weed and like hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still hanging out in my car and
smoking weed after I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have anywhere to go,
like hang out with people too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a handful of clubs in
California that allow smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool thing about California is we got
backyards at a lot of bars and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but like not exactly to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in New York, I experienced these
lounges in these places like Metro Bud
[SPEAKER_00]: Lounge is a place and you can just go,
you know, chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got like video games and couches and
like meet other stoners and kick it with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like have those conversations and
chill things you get to have for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's dive into a little bit of
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about yourself, how you got
started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I remember smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely like wanted some dank,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was raised by RBL posse and I
knew all about not wanting Bama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted dank, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was seventh grade Mill Valley
middle school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked the kid from eighth grade,
Dave Ross to, you know, to buy a swamp
[SPEAKER_00]: sack from him of dank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a bong, I had acquired bong at
the flea market.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those old like purple, like plastic
tube ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the knockoff graphics ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these, I mean, yeah, these were
knockoff graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went and smoked the bowl of that
with Chris and my pipe bong together in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bushes by Mill Valley middle school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I feel like I just like loved
weed ever since then and like dank weed
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it went legal and everything here,
I think I started like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: planting seeds and stuff went in like
maybe like 98, like around when I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get my medical, like around 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, people I knew grew,
I kind of found out that my dad grew from
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody from high school because he was
like, oh my God, like your dad grows a
[SPEAKER_00]: hell of a good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little bit sheltered in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got, I think I started trimming
for people in like 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Crest side in Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like hanging the trees like
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had, we were just all sitting
around this big circle with like the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: tree hung like that, trimming them with
like paper scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys trim wet or trim dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think, I feel like it was dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started trimming wet a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We trimmed wet first and then we hang it
and then trim it off the bud or off the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd also have the fresh frozen
that was wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the fine trim, we'd put that in the
freezer and make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing that right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, originally we didn't do anything
with our trim, but then once somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: figured out how to do bubble hash,
we started freezing all our trim to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the bubble hash and amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't even have bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally there was a silk screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use solo cups and you poured it
over the silk screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stirred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like this recipe, you know,
and you had to stir it one way and then
[SPEAKER_01]: stir it the other way and then scoop it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the silk screen and let it,
we used to let it dry on the silk screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who showed you how to do all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddy Micah showed me some of the
stuff who I was partners with for quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a group of a bunch of us that
just kind of shared the information
[SPEAKER_01]: between the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's like trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't pay trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all helped each other trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like there was trim parties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, we're going to go party at
someone's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I remember watching,
I mean, this late 90s, early 2000s
[SPEAKER_01]: watching the disc set of In Living Color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We watched those over and over and over,
but we trimmed and I think I still have
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they're sticky with resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from way back in the day, but yeah,
I mean, it was a different, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: different world back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we had knife hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have dabs really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we smoked, we smoked extract on
coal with the little tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also did knife hits and knife
hits were what would, you'd smoke the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, old school hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot pressing between two knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a super hot dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruin your throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're, I think the generation of
us that did that have some pretty damaged
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the hot, I mean, we were doing
hot dab and then we're doing hot dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravity, gravity bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't a question for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do gravity bongs back in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did gravity, hot knife, gravity bongs
before too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'll wreck your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a milk carton off and like put it
over the sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend who jumped into a swimming
pool with a five gallon alhambra,
[SPEAKER_01]: hit himself in the face with it,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have another friend,
he had his gravity bong with a two liter
[SPEAKER_01]: that was in a cooler in his closet at his
parents' house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gross water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super gross, you know, but we all had our
fun ways of smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the glass pipes back then,
everyone had, it was before all the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was done by like artists and yeah,
it was all, it was all produced by real
[SPEAKER_01]: artists and they were sold at the head
shops and you know, they were still fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: inexpensive, but they were pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the work that went into
them and yeah, I mean, late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my one pipe for hell along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the skull pipe I had and it
finally broke, but I really had that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have amazing glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, but there's a lot of
Chinese glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before there was the Chinese glass,
there was a lot of artists that made it
[SPEAKER_01]: from everywhere from Eugene, Oregon,
I mean, Portland, Washington, all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were getting stuff from all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, head shops were so cool,
you know, and that's like where you would
[SPEAKER_00]: learn things back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally find stuff at head shops and grow
shops, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get them on the lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you went to a dead show or you could go
to telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to get some telegraph was a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say telegraph or history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had seashell pipes back in the day that
were like resin on the, there were like a
[SPEAKER_01]: resin material on a seashell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put a screen in there and the
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go get a new screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to get new clean screens off
telegraph.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a place called gypsy trader in
this guy, raw zone, gypsy trader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd like to wheel and deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we used to ride skateboards to
telegraph or hopefully get a ride from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody before we even were able to
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to mighty Quinn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got mighty Quinn in, in San Rafael.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was all really good at smoke
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke shops are so dope in Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all, there's like 10,000 of these
like smoke shops in New York and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: have just Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Amazon runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these dusty, you know,
like Bart Simpson, like plastic bongs,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the ones like I started on,
on 12, but worse and like no supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like smoke shops are supposed to be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to go in there and find
all these cool little things and like ways
[SPEAKER_00]: of smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like the hippie side of it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the smoke shops that have the tie
dye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you gotta get some nog champa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta get some tie dye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you gotta be able to go through
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they have crystals, it's a bonus,
you know, it's like, I'm all about the
[SPEAKER_01]: crystals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a pretty big collection of
crystals that I've collected over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years and all that stuff, you know,
tapestries, all that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the custom glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a wide variety of pipes that
are all different sizes and all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, most of them, most of them I
don't use now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to drop or break them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some hand-blown chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chem dog pieces, the chem dog blue
that are pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some of the Grateful Dead Millies
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't make them like this anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do, but like, there's cool new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's cool new stuff and chem dogs still
blows glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at his glass online.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can still buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy as it was back then to
get them from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, they're, they're in more
high demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these things that are slowly going
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have China who's producing
glass hand over fist and they're selling
[SPEAKER_01]: it for $5, just undercutting the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are okay with the
Chinese glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that could be said about pretty
much all markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still go for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still go to a farmer's market before
I'll go if they have a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a Safeway anytime or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people eat McDonald's and drink
Coke and like, you know, there's a market
[SPEAKER_00]: for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there is China can't undercut you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they just can't do hand made like
that or, you know, buy an artisanal glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's what you might call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, even flour, we go back into
the quality of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can grow at a large
quantity and you can get a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, but you're not going to get the
artisanal quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think anything when you're trying
to replicate it at that scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's much more difficult to control all
the variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the guy who's putting his love into
the plant and it goes like tomatoes in
[SPEAKER_01]: your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go buy a decent, you can get a
Berkeley bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get pretty good tomatoes,
but then if you grow your own tomatoes in
[SPEAKER_01]: your backyard, you can pick them when
they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow each one exactly how you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also, the secret ingredient
with all of it is love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say and energy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you were talking about how much you
love crystals and like why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that first someone couldn't be
incapable of giving all that love to a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger grow and all that, but it's not the
focus in a lot of these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I know a couple of people that do
a really good job at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know people I worked for,
like, uh, I wish I could remember her name
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but the, one of the women
cultivators over at Floricow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, would have us, you know, they,
they would be telling each plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would have us doing that as we were
bucking it, trimming it, putting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar and sending it off, like doing
that whole energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I think that there's
gotta be like an energetic spiritual like
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with growing these THC crystals on
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in tomatoes, but perhaps even
more present because it's crystals in
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's gotta be alignment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I mean, I have my friends over at
SF Canada that crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fig farms in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of grows that I think they
do a great job for what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially at scale, but there's still
something to be said for the homegrown and
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow people everywhere to grow
homegrown weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, uh, it's, it's also just
such an amazing experience because then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a story behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're consuming something that
you help produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you understand pretty much every
day what happened to the life of that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're smoking it or you're sharing it
with your friends and there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: alignment there, that's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing my own and I always make
use of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a lot of times it's not as
good as what all my friends grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up like sort of giving that to
someone that might need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then smoking the other weed from other
friends that I like maybe better,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's always comes in valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the experience itself grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me love being in the garden and like
having something to cultivate and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and all the little smells that
come along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also love juicing my cannabis raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the leaves and the little nugs like
the juice, the leaves, but then the little
[SPEAKER_00]: nugs I'll put into like smoothies with
some fruit from my garden too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as something I can't really like at
this point get, although I hope down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line, I could maybe go to the grocery
store and buy like a frozen pack of like
[SPEAKER_00]: baby nugs that were super organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't want, you know, I didn't
spray these like either, so I don't want,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it sprayed with something
weird cause it's so fresh and raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, and you learn that to respect
the people that are the weed that was
[SPEAKER_00]: grown so well, you realize like,
you know, I'm going to pay some money for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, I, you know, it's not as good
as my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it teaches you that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be like, maybe I'm not in,
maybe I shouldn't, I don't have time and
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and I'm not that good at growing
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I should just buy other people's
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a lot of energy, a lot of
time, a lot of repetition to grow really
[SPEAKER_01]: good flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, not everybody appreciates it
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are okay with mediocre,
mediocre everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and also there, I mean,
mediocre, what is that anyways?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like, you know, subjective,
subjective indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it should smell good and taste
good and make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should, but like lots of people,
cause I did some budtending workout in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, got good read on the, on the,
you know, the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people, you know,
especially they want, they don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: want like it to be so strong, you know,
they want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually looking for like lower,
lower THC weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the older people, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good market though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking business, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big market, the baby boomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in looking for some stuff that
reminds them of the flower back in the 60s
[SPEAKER_01]: or 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom always talks about the Acapulco
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's her nostalgic weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she's born and raised in the Bay
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern lights even is pretty nostalgic
for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Piff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Piff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Cuban black haze, Piff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Piff is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a difference between Piff and
haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Piff is definitely a type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Piff comes from the Cuban black haze
and it's a, I believe it's an S1 of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cuban black haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is definitely hazy, but I feel like
it's on the more mild side of haze and
[SPEAKER_01]: they get that characteristic with the
tropinoline and limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it comes from places like
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's genetics from Africa that have
that characteristic in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's associated with a really
strong effect, but with the Piff,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not that strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I feel like it's, it's uplifting
and then it just kind of mellows off and
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes you feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Piff always makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy, Josh Freeman from Sebastopol
grows Piff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: In black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually rolling me up some right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the taste is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good down to the, if it's grown
correctly, it tastes good down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: roach and it has a unique flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not purple candy ass like everybody
likes, you know, like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little bit of the hazy,
but it's a, it's really an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, you know, and I would love to
see us getting back into more of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the varieties of cannabis that are just
outside the box a little bit, adding some
[SPEAKER_01]: more diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more of the old school stuff,
you know, train wrecky stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like train wreck, but I also like Durbin
poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also like Romulan like going back to
some Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We that's a popular Bay area genetic that
we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's from all over, but you know,
we definitely had it in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was real hot for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then we had some European
stuff and I really liked some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: European genetics that they, they,
they took California genetics and molded
[SPEAKER_01]: them their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some really interesting stuff
over there, like the Liberty Hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but some of the hazes are a little
bit too strong for people because they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they don't want to take just a half
a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to smoke like three or four hits
and they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people get heart palpitations and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like, uh, I think that the stuff
that leans on the sedative side is more
[SPEAKER_01]: popular right now, more of the indica,
but it all goes in waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, uh, 80%, more than 80%
of the market is purple candy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people want purple flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that there are a lot of
those people that think they're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: purple weed or smoking like hemp sprayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no, I mean, I think there's a
runts in gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato 33 runs in gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those though, but it's my install.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my, it's like, I think it's like
regional at this point, almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: regional tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your nostalgic flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cat piss from the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about it a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk, I'm doing a documentary later
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do one on cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some great stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some great storytellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's, there's amazing history
with cat piss and it's, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: argument on where it came from,
who created it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people want to take credit for
creating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe a lot of people did create
their version of cat piss and it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's something that smells like
ammonia and people relate that to cat
[SPEAKER_01]: piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the name blue dream where
it's like, okay, the Hayes brothers,
[SPEAKER_01]: they created the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's we can trace that back to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very specific name.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have something that describes an aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime someone in Kentucky or Florida
or LA or San Diego or the Bay area,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it was very popular here,
they grow something and it's got some
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia, you know, the first thing out of
a lot of people that are like cat piss,
[SPEAKER_01]: cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when cat piss came around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real cat piss was like, Oh,
it really does kind of gross, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes hella.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smoked hella good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is it was the ugliest
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, I love ugly weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at ugly weed is like,
is like catching my eye now after seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: all this like weird, I had a whole
revolution in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what turps sprayed was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what was, I've been just on
the hill trimming, staying out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for awhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, why does this like look
like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it don't, it's, and I've smoked a
couple of these like sparkly purply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stuff that's rolled in THCA
where they, they, they toss it in THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's especially if it's sticky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have the, they call them snowballs
or snowcaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a moon rocks 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I wasn't a really big fan of moon
rocks and they have their heyday and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: it went relatively quickly, which I think
is going to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I want to taste the real
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the sprayed turps where
they're infusing different flavors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't know how safe it is for
one thing, but I want the flower to
[SPEAKER_01]: represent the genetics and you know,
the effort that the grower went through,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the person who's infusing the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a, it's a market for the
flavor stuff, you know, and that's that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I personally, no thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor is so subjective and all these
things are so subjective to the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: from one person to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I mean, I think I can tell
somebody what good flower is, but it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: very personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with your own individual
relationship with the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with these flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, it's an
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's aromatherapy and,
but I think I read somewhere that the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are what inform our
endocannabinoid receptors, which
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to take into the system to,
you know, send out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I don't know if I'm right on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I think it's- We don't
know so much more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just still scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they just came out with the,
the white papers on flavorants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are basically thials and esters and
alcohols that are in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're just still scratching the
surface of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a better understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the fact that that's advancing,
but you know, it can all be traced back
[SPEAKER_01]: also to our relationship to the data
points that we've experienced in our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've smelled different types of rose
or you tell different types of orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it orange blossom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it orange peel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it orange juice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a orange extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a, is it fake candy,
orange turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so many different things
and the more data points we collect over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, whether it's with food or with life
experiences, that's how we see,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's our lens we see the world
under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the pretty amazing part is
like all these different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: different combinations of terpenes,
I guess there's 40,000 different terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: in existence that they know of,
which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the, the wide variety of
stuff that we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience over the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's going to change
from the purple candy to hopefully some
[SPEAKER_01]: other interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you smelled that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Donnie burger is pretty greasy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you consider nostalgic as
far as genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, what takes you back when you
smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we talked before about like,
you know, the champagne was the turp that
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always chasing down, but yeah,
that's the like weed I always wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the granddaddy purple,
when it was good in the purple days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, herbs and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple was trendy back in the day before
it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't purple actually,
the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the, we had real GDP that was dark
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Ken's Ken's GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them, they weren't super dark,
but then we had a, I mean, I remember my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends going super dark GDP where the
leaves were black and plants were real
[SPEAKER_01]: short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the first floral before all
the candy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was floral gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, I was chasing the rosé
around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this rosé that we did a fluorocal
was growing at a time was so, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like sexual turps, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we had like 50 trimmers and they're
all super stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see like a good data point
of like, what, like everyone kind of says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like, definitely one of those
just like, everyone's like, Ooh,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, like, you know, can't get enough of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it's related to the creme rosé
from aficionado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had this one, Leo had this one,
uh, the, at least my buddy had the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was rosewater turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like rosewater, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it wasn't the most complex,
but it was like, it smelled like perfume
[SPEAKER_01]: almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a perfume, but like a sweet
undertones and then all that flavor in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pressing it and it was like
lavender, rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I bet it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had another one over there
called Rollins, which was like a Nigerian
[SPEAKER_00]: land cross and like a lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that was a really fire and also
like super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I miss like weed that really does get
you like super yonk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, Garth cultivator smoked
some of maybe his hello with me,
[SPEAKER_00]: his hello strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the last time that I really
like hit some weed and was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I cough so hard, but it was like that
cough that would expand or cough where
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs are like doing things and then
you're about to be whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just like, not just bloodshot
eyes, but like blood red eyes and just
[SPEAKER_00]: that like, I'm hella high right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really been getting that from,
for any bud too much for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why I dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll take you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed took me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the day, I think weed
took us there a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know if we watered
down all of the land race genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're never going to have that potency
back or is there the science going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring us back?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's, you got to convince
these people to grow some of these longer
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, uh, these longer flowering
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people got to pay for that because
if you think, you know, you want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: twice as long flowering time, that's going
to cost twice as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, you know, definitely
feeding into the lack of, I think like
[SPEAKER_00]: more quality stuff on the market here is
like, if you're going to push the price
[SPEAKER_00]: down that people, I mean, the math isn't
mapping in California right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really got to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were talking about the Northern
lights and we were talking about haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, just off the top of my
head, the, the PIF is an L five times
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's Northern lights times haze
is what makes the PIF and same thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Fort Collins cough smoke the PIF in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tasted like Northern nights a little
bit to me because it is it's Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: lights times haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing with the Fort Collins
cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another amazing, that one's pretty
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually the Fort Collins cough is pretty
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's got this crazy flavor that
that's unmistakable that that's musky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice musky characteristic to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's unique to the Fort Collins
cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think people can dial down the
flowering time or you think that's success
[SPEAKER_00]: of a really good, like psychedelic sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're in that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying, yeah, I think, well,
I think someone made a point the other day
[SPEAKER_01]: that said the longer it takes to flower,
the longer the high, the longer the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, but we can breed into,
I mean, I've seen stuff bred into shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering varieties for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of stuff has gotten shorter
over time, but there is a relationship to
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and structure, terpenes and
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's all these interconnected
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so through work, through effort,
like if you have breeding goals where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, I like this specific flavor
over time, you can breed those to shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want sour diesel and we want to capture
this exact thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste good smells good as the similar
effect, but it doesn't take 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only takes eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those things are possible,
but they take a lot of work and they take
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, some of these passion
projects don't pay out for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that you do out of
passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, these are all fun things,
but I don't know that everybody wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke haze and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I think variety is good too,
cause there's a lot of us that do like
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking haze or do like smoking
interesting and different unique
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause I feel like terpenes have a lot
to do with the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the end of the day, I want to
try different effects for different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the taste of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles is amazing, but it also has a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it only gets you so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, the Skittles high,
it takes me up to about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never really like as much as I smoke,
I could smoke it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never takes me, but it's a great social
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can smoke it with everybody
and most people like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get them too high, you know,
and, and for maybe novices, it gets them
[SPEAKER_01]: super high or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I think for people that are
experienced smokers, it doesn't take them
[SPEAKER_01]: above that threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you take something like some hazes
and, or some Durban poison, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you smoke a couple puffs,
it gets you here, but a couple more,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that never ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep smoking more and it just
keeps getting you more high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are fun experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, where's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people, I mean, Redbeard's got his
red Congolese and Durban poison and those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those, yeah, there's people still doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people in San Francisco,
some people in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're harder to find though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, well, I'm interested to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of these like psychedelic
sativas are Southeast Asian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is, there is some, I mean,
I think Southeast Asia is where we got the
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex traits, the hermaphrodite stuff
from, which that's heavily been bred into
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have issues with hermaphrodites now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, people just need to stress
test their weed more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the breeders, the guys growing and
the guys putting stuff out, need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: more stress testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that job like real seriously and
really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if they don't, someone else will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you feel like the stress hardest
thing to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the easiest, like the easiest least
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the easiest, the one, if you want to
feel really good about yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought you were going to say wedding
cake, but yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wedding cake's a good example,
but I would say blue dream is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the apical of structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has the, I mean, in my opinion is
the, as far as structure goes and easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, it is, it's very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to feel good about yourself,
grow blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to feel bad about yourself,
she grows some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an OG, well, I mean, for me back in the
day it was OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also a Girl Scout cookies was like
low yielding, hard to grow, very finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like so excited to finally get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the nugs were like this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like is the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So train wreck had like the really like
these clusters and really bad node
[SPEAKER_01]: spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but blue dream is like the strong
plant, just easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't, you, even if you're not a good
grower, you can get really good flower out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really simple and
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the more you push it,
the bigger it'll get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the genetics you've been
spoken on lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought some sun ground, full term sun
ground that I was super stoked to find
[SPEAKER_00]: that my buddy grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a cross of sunset Sherbur,
enchilado and ice cream cake and runs and
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that sounds all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and got some of Mendo Doughboy's
heady OG at the Organican, which is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was stoked cause it was like $20 for
eighth, which just felt like norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've normalized again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go get an eighth of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like some decents for 20 bucks plus
tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's their outdoor and it's good
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like excited to see it's like
kind of shaggy cause OG shaggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My OG was just super dense and it didn't
have very many leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pine cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the nested, the nested Brax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have a lot of a crazy shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll look like pine cones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outdoor OG is like some of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seven from the 707, I swear it's,
it's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good goes good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG is a special one and it's making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like OG is definitely making a
comeback along with all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour should make a comeback too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the year of sour and haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to have to switch over to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about your radio show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now it's drive time, which is
super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three to 6 PM on Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to reduce it down to
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm broad when I'm in New York,
I'm broadcasting it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm here in the studio,
I go in the studio and I play like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, smoking music, stoner music,
music to smoke too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely music you could put on for your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're an independent radio
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I include independent artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like try to give women other like
an open door poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if whatever you're doing,
if you're a woman, you can come and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about your thing and I'll play your music
or if it's like fashion, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do a ton of interviews though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do sometimes do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the YouTube channel where I've
gone out and about sort of like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it like Mr. Rogers neighborhood on
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm out in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to people from other sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I started playing a lot
of meadow dope boys, Garth cultivator,
[SPEAKER_00]: high grade all-stars and a lot of
cultivator music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond like reggae that you might want to
might think of as like the first music.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through that and playing that music and
that station and that show, I've got like
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that listen to me in Vallejo
and all the people that tune into AusCat
[SPEAKER_00]: online too, as my sort of community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always have meadow dope boys on
every year we do an interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, they're going to come into the
studio, but it's always been, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID and everything through like them and
Garth cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of grown the network and my
community on like my Instagram of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally, cause they've got this
great community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the best thing about radio and
the internet is the international
[SPEAKER_01]: community can tap in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough with the shadow banning,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I love my YouTube channel cause
I love to do the show and tell and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had like Mike Meesey, I don't know
if you know who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying, I got five on it,
the hook, but he's also a third gen grower
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, a Mendo family and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had like play his music and have him
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of like the Bay culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent like, I'm from, you know,
Vallejo and Mill Valley also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I've got connections in New York
from the rave scene and being a DJ and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took the vibe to New York of like
what we know to be our culture of like
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so I call it now, I'm starting to
call it now the culture of compassion,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, cause it's a little bit of a
different view.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, when I first started working in
cannabis, it was all about like the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and like medicine and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, I kind of just like have
this show every week on the radio and I
[SPEAKER_00]: play the music there and it's grown to be
like more artists and allow a lot of Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: dope though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of like, I just love playing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other people associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do the videos and everything
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in New York, I met this guy,
Jimmy Young, who does pro cannabis media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the California correspondent for
that now, which is like We Talk News.
[SPEAKER_00]: He offered it to me and I just decided to
take it to be the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to be, you know, I feel like
I could, I'm going to offer some good
[SPEAKER_00]: stories up and tell the stories to the
rest of the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's from Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like all these other
correspondents on there from different
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of enjoy watching the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just every week, just like everybody
telling people like me telling the news
[SPEAKER_00]: from their states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, I haven't done any of this
for a penny so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done this out of like my love of the
culture and to want to like be the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I was like, I told all,
you know, all my friends and they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of all starting to come around and stuff
and people in their own time to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice and to tell their story when it's
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like holding the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the show every week and some,
so I don't make new content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure with your podcast here,
it's, you know, it's a lot to create
[SPEAKER_00]: content all the time and promote it and
post it and honor every story that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I see us as kind of storytellers and
we're able to record some oral history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, it's all about the oral
history side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully in 50 years, people look
back and be like, yeah, that was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many angles to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw that you were doing,
you were doing a lot of people that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping to might come on my show or coming
on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's getting told.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a community and that's kind of
what it's about too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about, it's not competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in this together and I feel like
it's just, it's a, it's a beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing thing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry in a lot of ways is amazing,
you know, in a lot of ways it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: scary, you know, but that's life with
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, to be able to record some of
these people like Richard DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's a great storyteller.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filmed some good stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then both of the D'Angelo brothers
are characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they've, they've got their
stories too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the stories to be told and
for like that torch of compassion to be
[SPEAKER_00]: held.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like, so when I started Bay Sesh,
I always called it like a weekly sesh to
[SPEAKER_00]: inspire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our evolution, meaning like our evolution
from like traditional to what it is now,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever wants to participate and do what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's support them, you know, let's invite
the OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's invite the new people that are going
to bring something new to the table too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, let's find ways to come together
over this beautiful plant, this thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: all love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's an amazing thing that brings us
all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, people from all walks of
life that would never she is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people from all walks of life can,
can sit at the same table and have a great
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about something that they
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's something that unites
us all and makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings compassion and empathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scientifically proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we are, you know, we are really
giving a lot to the world with this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and by cultivating it and sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, that's the, you know,
we don't want that to be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the, in the hustle bustle of trying to
survive in the industry or make a dime or
[SPEAKER_00]: get, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you see the future of the
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking five years or 10 years
into the future, what do you see going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like the thing is the economics of
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Canada and Mexico has been gearing up
to everybody's going to have to go legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now the argument is like,
Oh, declassify or I'm like unclassified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been told by some people
from DC that like, cause my whole thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, look, it's reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's built on a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they just give up the lie already?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, but they won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to go with this,
like, you know, starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: declassification or not, but we're going
to argue about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to reschedule instead of
de-schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The economics of it, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gotta be a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's especially when we're competing on
the North to the North and the South with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Canada and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously there's got to be a commodity
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to get interstate trading going
or, you know, opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ridiculous happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like, unfortunately, like for the
farmers, I think that it's going to just
[SPEAKER_00]: end up being in the category of every,
all the other ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really know farmers aren't
ballers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those are those days of farmers or
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be super successful whether you go
tomatoes or corn or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you love what you're doing,
I think that's the most important thing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole rock star thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like at the end of the day,
if you're all about the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole ag model where we can be
farmers, that is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you can actually have a job doing
it, regardless of everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can have a job doing it where you
can make a successful living out of
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, it all comes down to how hard
you want to grind anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's not going to be worth,
it's going to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's on legal, it's a regular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be worth so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will still be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that also has a lot to do with
freshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all the medicinal things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the raw aspect of it I think is
going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's completely untapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cosmetics of it, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be integrated fully into our
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a food, it's a fiber, it's a building
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like we're in a startup
market here in California, within a
[SPEAKER_00]: startup market in the country,
within a global startup market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth rates are going to just be
going up, up, up everywhere forever for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next 10, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows how long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all kinds of directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of jobs could be created.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start doing hempcrete and some of these
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, we can start using it for
building materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are some of the biggest carbon
wasting issues that must be addressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether people want to whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and peak oil was a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's getting done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Saudis are gearing up for
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be biofuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil remediation, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can harvest it three times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just in the cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I kind of just like, let's just
call it the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the greater economic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's like, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things need to be corrected and
fixed in the regular economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full throttle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, California has, like I said,
like, you know, there's the cannabis thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's the greater issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fascinated right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking a lot about the
governor's United enforcement task force
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've put together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like camp part two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just kind of got started the end of
2021 and it's incorporating like all sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the DEA, federal and state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And local jurisdictions and also
administrative branches too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're hoping to basically hammer down
on fines and collect fines and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay for all this enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just sounds like, again,
camp 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm interested, you know,
I've kind of been following that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reported for their first year 312
million that they seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also interested to find out I think
it's time for them to stop valuing the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed so high if they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, I'm like, well,
how many pounds was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve hundred seven thousand dollars a
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to stop with those inflated
worse, you know, but it was like a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and ninety one thousand plants eradicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they do target these like
illegal grows and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they're starting in this
administrative branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been a lot of like FBI stings
where they're posing as inspectors and
[SPEAKER_00]: even posing as DCC inspectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually FBI and getting
people on bribery and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much going on here,
so much enforcement still, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is like a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's holding the industry back in that
way because it's like they're at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, you got to pay for
this, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that other markets are being able to
do so much more already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should have been the leaders of it
all.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, life is strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long, strange trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are still leaders of it all,
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're 20 years ahead of everybody here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have 20 million acres of farmland
and we supply all the strawberries and the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries and the celery is from here to
the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a beautiful, amazing place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just see what happens, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self that started out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, what would that one
piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could do it all over again,
I would have become a doctor so I could
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe people with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to convince so many people
that are on the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be like this barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people sit now that it's recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's the recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, it could help your stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could help so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything, but I feel like- It's
medical whether you believe it is or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perrone said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most famous person you hung out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a story about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most famous person I hung out with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you got some good stories.
Ever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just more of like- Or
someone that you smoke weed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked hanging with Kappa Donna at
the Emerald Cup a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a good story too,
because so I come up and that girl Anika I
[SPEAKER_00]: was telling you about from Black Market
Certified, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got strains, developing strains for
Kappa Donna and Havoc from Mobb Deep and
[SPEAKER_00]: Corrupt from the Dog Pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had all of them in this table at
the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my home girl Carmen, who's doing PR
for Snoop Dogg or Robbie D Presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, you did me a favor for
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You helped us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I network a lot of people with weed and
industry stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's like, I want you to come meet all
these guys with this girl at Black Market
[SPEAKER_00]: Certified, Anika.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go over there and Kappa Donna was so
cool, but he was looking so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had like rolled, like he had like 50
blunts he'd already rolled sitting there
[SPEAKER_00]: that he'd taken like a few hits off of
because he was trying to find good skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, so he was, it's a cup,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of growers are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of people are going to,
if you're Kappa Donna, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, they're coming up to you and
they're like, you know, you want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: this weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew this weed, that weed, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's on the hunt for skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, and I could tell by looking at
that pile that it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing was even close to what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you find that weed that you love,
like that, that flavor that you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, cause if you're a real, real stoner,
you're that turp hound, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, this is the one, you know,
clearly he hadn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we smoked with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked, I had some like really like GMO
bat crosses with Giles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, man, you know, it's not skunk,
but it's like in the area of like funk,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, he's, he smoked it a
little bit more than the rest of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the right family at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gas along with the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's so many people that smoke
weed out there, but like my, my big like
[SPEAKER_00]: superstar Gaga moment was smoking with Gar
Cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's like my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed matched the attitude and the
music that he, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I still remember like getting
that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and I can't, it was at Dinks
given up in, in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you were a DJ, what kind of music
was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: House music?
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day DJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My old DJ name was Baby Panther.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like a, I did hip hop and before
dubstep was around, I used to take drum
[SPEAKER_00]: and bass and like turn it all the way down
and put it over like rap acapella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I played battle style and like I
scratched and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the old school drum and bass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had jungle music and drum and bass back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't even know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the drum and bass was way different
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like ground score and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at Compound Records back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I had skippity and like
shy effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got real heavy in a rag or jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my show is actually very similar to
what I used to play back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the mix, which is like the bass
sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously like these are events,
but I liked, I'm like, I'm giving it to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys can just blame it on the
radio show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bass sesh, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a radio show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, it was always the blend of like
radio raves and reggae and like
[SPEAKER_00]: Storyville, like underground hip hop
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of go between those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because people are doing that
now, but you were way before your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bringing it back, you know,
but that is the Bay culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned about being in New York,
like immersing myself that much and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and being here is like, we are like one
culture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody's, it's like one cool
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love NorCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say the Bay, I feel like the
Bay all the way up to Oregon is like
[SPEAKER_01]: still, it's all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And LA is its own thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: LA is San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really cool friends down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I like a lot of things about it,
but it's not where I would necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: want to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just find myself gravitated towards
the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time we leave, we ended up coming
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring the culture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've enabled some people that feel
confident about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taught a lot of people how to figure
out what the good weed is versus whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the weird stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took me like a lot of investigating to
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, took some people under my
wing and then I'm ready to just come home
[SPEAKER_00]: because New York's going to do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather just be a visitor there in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if people are looking to get ahold
of you, where can they find you?
