[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today is my good friend, Rob from West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana, how are you doing, Rob?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew up together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone want to hear where I got the
cookies cut from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the guy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010-ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, give or take a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it from you, but you got it from our
good friend, Polly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it from a store in Berkeley off of
Fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Berkeley Inter-Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the one on the side streets from a
cat that was working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cookies cut was a big deal back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many other genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was probably the first
genetic you could call an exotic in the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole industry and super sought after.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when we dropped those drop the
flower at the dispensary at my club,
[SPEAKER_02]: RIP to the club, we had a line down the
street.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one in San Jose had it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was super cool for us to have
something unique, even though our
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary looked like a little trap shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sure was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of yield, not very big colas,
prone to some issues, grew a little
[SPEAKER_02]: sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the cut that we had, it grew a
lot like OG in the sense that the node
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing was really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't produce a ton of leaves,
but the node spacing was bad and you'd get
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that were growing four inches apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to trellis it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't, it would just, I bet it
would grow along the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would if you let it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if you would.
[SPEAKER_02]: We double trellis everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much to defoliate because there just
wasn't much there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay on top of some PM, depending on your
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this wasn't the forum cut,
we had it as Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that we had that there was
one Girl Scout cookies in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the one that we had that I
had seen from other people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I think some people
will say, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion around stuff, but there's the
forum cut and forum cut was different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut that we had, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was a thin mince cut that
everyone kind of ran with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thin mince was the spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grew up like spears and you grew
like longer buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the forum was nice big chunky
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was kind of neither of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it was just, it was
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't there in the circle of the guys
that made the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of mystery behind the.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I spoke to a couple of those
guys and they were, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: always very eager to figure out how did
you get your hands on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh, a gentleman never tells,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, 14 years later, we're still
rocking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still like cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it has its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people don't even
understand how impactful Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like a lot of stuff that
has bread in it, you get that bread from
[SPEAKER_00]: your wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, any sort of, you know,
that, that doughy kind of bready
[SPEAKER_00]: character.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the cookies, like I said,
it was the first one you really call an
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic of the available genetics are
around and cookie fam and those guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: they did a fantastic job and all the,
all the dessert strains that came after
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once gelato hit and then, then boom,
it's been, it's been nonstop since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of flipped the whole industry on
his head as far as all the herms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think, but yeah, I mean,
I think that was the beginning of a new
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause before that there was a lot of
diversity too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, we had art cushions,
we had the OGs, we had the sours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, you know, there was the varieties
of like the Bubba, the Hindu.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw those, the master Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the, but it wasn't a
modern day exotics are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple candy gas or the purple gas as
cookies was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause cookies had like a nice cherry nose
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was bready and a little bit
creamy and gassy and it's smoked and it
[SPEAKER_00]: could smoke down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I would say is it's kind of a
double edged sword with all the desserts
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in and all that is, you know,
before that, before Girl Scout Cookies in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, we had, we had Sativas and we had
Indicas and we had you know, we had some
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids, but Indicas and Sativas right
nowadays, like, you know, how hard is it
[SPEAKER_02]: to find a Sativa out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: God, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so they're out there, but everything
is a hybrid nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've because they, everyone wanted to
have the prettiest weed and throw as many
[SPEAKER_02]: names they can in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've lost towards the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In politics we go far left, far right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cannabis it's been, okay,
everything's a hybrid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some super amazing Indicas
that you can find sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some super amazing Sativas,
you know, we can go like these amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: cushions on that far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get these, you know,
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still see once in a while, you know,
like, yeah, red Congolese and Durban's and
[SPEAKER_00]: some Colombian stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see stuff that has hints of it in
there, but you don't see the land race
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, some of the companies
that I was super excited that were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they've gone out of business,
but you know, like Redbeard's got some
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing Sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll look into them because I'm,
you know, hunting for some good Sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I ran recently again,
I hadn't ran in ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Blue Dream is on the comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh Freeman, my good friend, Josh
Freeman, he's growing Blue Dream again as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like Blue Dream is making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just, I'd rather say OG Kush is
making a comeback because it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I prefer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the most amazing structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the single most demanded,
you know, genetic Oliver's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: because Justin Bieber talked about it,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive back into your history,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a long history with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you get started smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was God, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1991, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that's for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I sat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my year too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I sat down at the table at my
friend's house and had the purple graphics
[SPEAKER_02]: box from the old graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made on the shop on telegraph.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember like taking this first
big milky rip and coughing my ass off and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just assumed that's how you're supposed
to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of put my head down on the
table and I've seen, I can still see it to
[SPEAKER_02]: this day, like checkerboard black and
white and like this blue and purple sky
[SPEAKER_02]: just flicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Whoa, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to cuss on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say where the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to hear, but, but yeah,
I remember just sitting at that table and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they're like, all right, Rob,
you need to go, go lay down on the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, man, that was, that was
fucking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and then I was hooked from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as far as cultivation go,
is that that started back in about 2003,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2004 for me, uh, you know, anything in
passing a closet grow, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's we did, we did, I did that probably
back in 99, but like in terms of actually
[SPEAKER_02]: setting up a real grow and like playing
the game of getting the U hall fricking
[SPEAKER_02]: truck and having to like take all these
side streaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're worried they're watching with the
helicopters and not sounding a paranoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they, really did do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just being super underground and
like having to hide every inch of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but you know, we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by 2009, I bought my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just, just growing up into that
point until I finally, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ah, I think I want a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worst decision of my life, but you know,
also, also the best because it opened up
[SPEAKER_02]: the doors to everything we've been,
you know, I've been doing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it's, you know, it's, it's been a
good run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not lots of ups and downs, you know,
uh, the ups were really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The downs are pretty tragic, but that's,
that's just the nature of the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're in an industry that is
still gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of us like ourselves have been in
it since it was totally, totally dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, you, you just,
you just keep running and hope for the
[SPEAKER_02]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll with the punches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a seven, get up eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, that's the plan or nine or 10
or 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, the past couple of
years, two and a half years, I hope I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: exaggerating, but I feel like 90% of the
businesses, the industry is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I go to the shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not seeing the brands I used to
see back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not even in cannabis, but everything
things have changed since COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even barely go out in San
Francisco and find a meal late at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But good food, you used to be able to get
food in the cities and I feel like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still find some food, but it's not like it
used to be where you got midnight and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's restaurants open a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world's changing and we just got to
roll with the punches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, I'm happy to still be here
fighting the fight with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is my passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple, you know, I guess real
careers to fall back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just dreading the day that that might
ever come.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pushing as hard as I can to,
to keep this dream alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't want to, I want to go back
to selling houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us, I mean, you've done so much in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's talk about how you got
your start in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would be the dispensary,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause before that I was just cultivating,
uh, living a good life, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was over in Scotts Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause back then, uh, Santa Cruz County
allowed 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I rented this cool house in Scotts
Valley and it was like me and my three
[SPEAKER_02]: dogs and this big old house had a 20
lighter underneath and downstairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, my, my day to day is get
up, go for a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jog on the beach, have some breakfast and
pull out weed maps and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, well, where are we stopping by
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: And grab a few packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then, you know, 4,000 a pound for
blue dream, 3,800 with no questions asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, you know, you get 40 pounds
out of a grow and it was, it was good
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should buy a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was, that was, uh, an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so anyway, but I guess, uh,
what led me to the dispensary without,
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to train jiu-jitsu with this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a, he was a programmer for a big
fortune 500 company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had taken some of his IPO money and
said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try cannabis out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it turns out he wasn't a cannabis
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he didn't really, he didn't do too
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dumped a bunch of money into the
start of the dispensary and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: his wife wasn't big on customer service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they had bad product and bad
reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, long story short, he said,
he said, well, technically I was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: about to open a bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd put money aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the build out, negotiated lease,
found a liquor license, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally about a week before I pulled
the trigger on that, he comes like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob, and I'd been vending to him for
a year or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you know, I'm just over this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think you'd be a better fit for,
for what we're trying to do over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, fuck it,
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took it over and that's when,
uh, I started learning what the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: was really about, you know, dealing with,
uh, the city council, the city of San Jose
[SPEAKER_02]: and them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to put, uh, you know,
trying to ban dispensaries altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: We filed referendums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took, I started taking a real major role
in the fight against the city council,
[SPEAKER_02]: the city of San Jose as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to ban all the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, they fought, we filed a referendum,
went out and raised a bunch of signatures
[SPEAKER_02]: to, uh, to overthrow the ballot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wouldn't even do a moratorium,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to do a moratorium,
but they also want to do a flat out ban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first time we beat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, the second time they went
about it with a land use thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, okay, so a dispensary can't be
within a thousand feet of a school,
[SPEAKER_02]: a park, a daycare, rehab, a church,
or like anything from a city planning
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint, you, they put all these things
in places for accessibility for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they do it, uh, they call it as
the crow flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if there's a freeway and all these
natural barriers in between where you are
[SPEAKER_02]: in that dispensary, uh, it's a straight
line on a map, not how far away it is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually physically get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they just found this kind of
loophole way of going about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it restricted the available land
that a dispensary could be on to what may,
[SPEAKER_02]: it worked out to be about 1% of,
of the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course it's in the worst places
because why wouldn't there be,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, churches and daycares and
all these things, unless you're in some
[SPEAKER_02]: crappy industrial or high crime area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone was crowded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was also rules about how
close the dispensaries could be to each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then you also had, you had to like
kind of have a build out that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent of like Fort Knox, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If your facility, you had to have the
land, you had to have the building,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to have this crazy build out
before you could even get the permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's companies spending millions of
dollars to make all this happen and then
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get the permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a city of San Jose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really difficult to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, this is when I saw this
happening, I'm like, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is my time to kind of check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sold the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2012 and jumped into the brand side of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, okay, well, um, you know,
when it comes to being a retail
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary, you have to deal with all the
headaches of the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're after, when you're a
cultivation, you deal with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: headaches of a grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, brands are kind of insulated from all
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, the, the more saturated the market
gets with flour, the cheaper it gets,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better it is for the brand to acquire
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it just seemed like a smarter bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I dived in and then I, uh, became a
partner in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were America's first marijuana
cigarette company in terms of a cigarette
[SPEAKER_02]: pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, won a bunch of high times awards and
hemp con cups and, uh, Jack Herrera cups
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of went across the whole country
pushing our cigarette pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was baby bash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a burner for a short time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Scott are the guy that kind of founded
the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we ran with that for years and that
was a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, all good things come to an
end and, uh, you know, California find is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of chilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still, still alive, but not really
doing anything at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I launched West Coast Kana in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost, we launched West Coast Kana as
West Coast Kanagar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made a, uh, 3.5 gram cigar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love the Kanagars,
but a 3.5 grams cigar is almost kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: novelty product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a lot of refining over
the, over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came up with what our flagship
product is our, our Canarillo or West
[SPEAKER_02]: Coast Canarillo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a diamond infused hemp cone with,
uh, you know, exotic flower and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, it's a size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more palatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people will blow through these
and enjoy it and not have to waste half of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put out a, how big are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 1.1 and 1.2 grams, a quarter of that
or 0.3 of that is diamonds and the rest is
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll smoke one here in a little bit.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are THCA diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're, now we're getting to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the THCA diamonds we've been using for
years now, uh, long before the THCA craze
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're seeing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, we'll just jump to that part
of the conversation because THCA,
[SPEAKER_02]: let me back it up for us personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I saw, um, there's a lot
happening federally, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: With cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's talk of rescheduling,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's talk of flat out, either a flat
out legalization, not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deschedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deschedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a rescheduling I think is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're talking about is going
from a schedule one to schedule three,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, schedule one's PCP and
schedule three is aspirin, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that just means they get to
regulate the hell out of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has to be FDA labs and cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second that that happens and it's
no longer the threat of a felony and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then banking opens up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're no longer competing with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're completely competing with big pharma
and you know, Pfizer, we're competing with
[SPEAKER_02]: anhyzer bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're competing with, with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meta, anyone, Google, anyone that's got
money that wants to make more money is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to see the opportunity that is in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we're all getting blown away
if we don't have something to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a sad truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, five years ago I said,
Hey, I'm, you know, I'm 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could work this business until the day I
die and be totally happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always kind of did everything for
the brand as if we're never selling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to just run this forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, you know, recently this past
year or so I'm like, man, if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really going to reschedule this and do the
schedule three thing, um, we're all in big
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do I get West coast, Canada
everywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we own enough shelf space,
enough real estate, uh, nationwide that
[SPEAKER_02]: when this happens, you know, they come and
approach us and they try to buy us rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than strangles to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, keep us on board to be
able to work it because they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it creates the opportunity for us to
have that in that career in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: forever and ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of having to, you know,
go back to doing something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, uh, THCA, the THCA craze kind of
hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, THCA is, is hemp,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until it's decarboxylated is hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that we're just selling hemp
and we can sell it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under federal like regularization THCA is
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is CBN?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta A, CBB, THCV, THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, 2018 farm bill states that,
you know, every other cannabinoid can be,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be worked with aside from Delta nine,
but THCA is, uh, is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so 2018 farm bill says that if it's
not Delta nine, then you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the, obviously the short
version of it, but, um, every cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: has had a craze attached to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like CBD came out and boom, well,
everyone's on CBD and Delta A came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, Delta, all these
cannabinoids come out and because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not really effective in so many ways as
the people are looking for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: AKA getting high, it kind of fizzles out
and there's that little, that little,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, wave, you know, crashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all have their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of settle in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, I mean, CBD is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the CBD brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super useful, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is super useful for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not allowed to make any medical claims
and we don't do that, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things you can do some research on.
[SPEAKER_02]: On to find out what CBD is good for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd take it to this day every single
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it to my dogs every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it to my family members.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a use, but the masses that are out
spending money every single day,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately are buying CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Delta A has a little wave and it
spikes and it finds its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there was Delta 10 for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people realized, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's just nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's like TACO and TACP and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these other... THCP is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add 5% of some THCP distillate and
you've supercharged it to an... You
[SPEAKER_02]: supercharge your regular distillate to an
uncomfortable state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it gets really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So THCP is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But THCA, all those... To back up a little
bit, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those cannabinoids had their heyday,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of like slowed down and
found their place.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said, and there is a place for all
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched some amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG, CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy makes a product called a
night-night and his pre-rolls and puts the
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN in there and everyone loves them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sleep so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sleep hella hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sleeping pills, no NyQuil, no Ambien or
any of that crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit a night-night and you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they all have their place, but because
they don't get you high, the wave kind
of...
[SPEAKER_02]: crashes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the one cannabinoid that has legs to
it, in my opinion, is THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in its raw form, it is hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I telling too much on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I giving too much information to get us
all in trouble later?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I think we can be straight with
the THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important because it's the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But THCA definitely has its value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Texas recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You visited my parents, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But THCA, I go into the CBD shops and
they've got THCA under the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a dispensary, but you're going
in there and you're looking at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at it and the guy shows me the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it looks like regular flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, that's THCA flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I can't believe... That's
THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks amazing, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taste was actually surprisingly
not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it was amazing,
but it was... It still has that hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor to it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one wasn't hemp flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't super terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it could have been grown a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the THCA, they're pulling early,
but technically most CBD that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, if you harvest it past a certain
point, it'll test hot anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're keeping the D9.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to harvest early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with CBD, even pharmaceutical,
unless it has zero T, which there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of companies that have germplasm
that has zero THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the pathway is blocked from CBG,
so it doesn't convert into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, that stuff will all
pretty much get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time that D9 is developing
late in the term is also a lot of that
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene production, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that flavor we're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you could pull a little early and
you get more of an earthy taste and then
[SPEAKER_02]: what the genetic would normally create.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so THCA falls into my lap and
I'm like, this is literally like two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: after D9, I'm like, oh no, what are we
going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to survive if Pfizer
comes in and has a half a billion dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: in marketing budget just to destroy
everybody in this path?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're either going to buy them or
they're just going to choke them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like alcohol at the end of
prohibition, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I'm trying to figure out,
making these crazy plans, building this
[SPEAKER_02]: insane business plan, kind of our next few
years of life, THCA hits and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this isn't a Delta A or a CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a CBD that will have a peak and then a
valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one will sustain because of states
like Texas and Florida that don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: legal cannabis the way we do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are huge, huge markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as people get an access to the
medicine without having to deal with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the headaches of being in Texas and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delivered to their doorstep legally,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Delivered to their doorstep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pack a box and get on the airplane.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you got your documentation,
you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop it in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things, these is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you get your brand in 50 states
in a short amount of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally think it's THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's kind of been a godsend for us
because it's given us an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: scale where we otherwise would have had to
give up a lot to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many different flavors do you guys
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we only have packaging for one,
lemon cherry gelato, because that's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have about 15 different THCA
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every farm that I've been dealing
with, they're constantly testing new
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics to see which ones perform better
and how they test and et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the stuff that we've got,
I mean, it's anywhere from like 0.1 to 0.2
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, this stuff's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we make our cannerillos and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're already using the THCA diamonds
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now the only thing that changes is
we use the THCA flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got this like, you know,
50% THCA testing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would have thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me 10 years ago, I'd say
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I call my attorney right when this
kind of hit and I'm like, Dom,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need you to like look into something for
me, looking at THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first it's like, no, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're risking everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, that's why I'm calling
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you actually read the farm bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, can you read into the farm bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he calls me like, four days later and
he's like, dude, I've been like diving
[SPEAKER_02]: into this thing and I'm researching each
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the farm bill is just a summary of a
bunch of different cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's going through every single
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of three days of research,
he lands back at 0.3 of Delta nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the, the differentiation of the
government's view of what constitutes
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and what constitutes hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it boils down to 0.3 of Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like he went, you know, he went down
the rabbit hole deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so according to him, who I put a lot
of trust in and paying him a lot for,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, he says we're good until we're not,
you know, and they, they changed the
[SPEAKER_02]: verbiage of the farm bill, which,
you know, I think we got about a year
[SPEAKER_02]: before that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they just passed the latest farm bill
four years, literally, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, two and a half weeks ago, three weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they actually, you know, so I'm not
sure when this airs, but, uh, based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline, but yeah, I mean, they,
they just signed into law, the new farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we should be good for another four
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was told that they pushed it out
one more year and that we weren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're still working on the
language.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm behind the times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I've been so, I have my head down
so buried so deep in this that I might've
[SPEAKER_02]: missed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was, what I was under the impression
of is they, we were supposed to vote on it
[SPEAKER_02]: last year in 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it got pushed out six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the most recent, um,
kind of, kind of come to Jesus meeting,
[SPEAKER_02]: they said, we're, we're still not ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to push out six more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just how one of us is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's me because I'll take four
years over two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, you know, maybe we got about
two more years and then hope the language
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in our favor and that kind of
dictates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by then, you know, rescheduling
might already occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I don't even know why
they're worried about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we're this close to where we
are, cause they're, they're saying two to
[SPEAKER_02]: three years on this rescheduling idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're that close, why do you guys give
a shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you care?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a, you know, you're throwing
money at this war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nonsense for, for no reason,
go a lot of other problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can devote some energy to the
homeless and fentanyl and fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I think the both are
contributing to, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tough with both of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fentanyl is a, is a really fucked up thing
and it's affecting a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homelessness is also affecting a lot of
people everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look in San Francisco, it's rough,
you know, and all, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all major cities, but I know the major
cities I've been to lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's been tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like Los Angeles, you go up and down
the West coast from Seattle all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down to San Diego and there's a homeless
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And funny enough, there's a consistency
in, in, in those three States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't got to talk about that as a
different conversation, but California in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular is kind of created a magnet
because of a lot of the social programs
[SPEAKER_02]: we've adopted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for better or worse, depending on
how you view things, when you offer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, free healthcare and free money
and free phones and free food and free
[SPEAKER_02]: housing to people, to illegal migrants,
to, to homeless people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have this huge opioid
problem, fentanyl problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are strung out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know what I would do if I was in
that scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a lot of time in LA and downtown
where, you know, a lot of our packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: and hardware, if I don't have time to wait
for trying to deliver, I go down there and
[SPEAKER_02]: Skid Row used to be this big and now it's
got its own zip code.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it used to be like one block
and now it's like, blocks and blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, if you're not,
you don't have protection with you when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're walking through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon they're going to assign addresses so
you can get mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little postbox next to the park
bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not, that's mean, but you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, and we've mainstreamed
homelessness and the same thing that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same street that someone's paying a
million five to be on and paying crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy living on his doorstep is getting
paid to live on that doorstep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this isn't sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyhow, that's a, let's talk about some
more fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I say, we can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about one of the craziest
experiences you had on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been fortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of them, you know,
baby bash, my business partner and one of
[SPEAKER_02]: my dearest friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done like full on tours where we're
doing, you know, big concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's performing with pit bull and,
you know, a lot of listed names,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big stars, ice cube and all
these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same time we're out there
promoting our cannabis brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I walk out on stage and it's like a
hundred thousand people in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's losing their fricking mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just chucking weed in the crowd to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's having a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, so a lot of stuff like
that, a lot of stuff like what the trade
[SPEAKER_02]: shows and the concerts, the music
festivals, cause music and cannabis are so
[SPEAKER_02]: closely tied together and having a major
artist as part of our brand has led us to
[SPEAKER_02]: some really, really cool places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the craziest stuff,
I mean, for me aside from that stuff is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, being that I'm an industry
person, just like you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get invited to go to places that most
people don't get to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in some facilities that,
I mean, even today blow my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just down in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met some guys at the MJ BizCon and we
ended up striking up a little buddy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a little friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go down to Orange County to visit
their lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, this, I'll show you some videos
in a bit, but this place is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they, this is a, if we get
rescheduled and then the FDA, they create
[SPEAKER_02]: rules and guidelines for how labs have to
operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are, they already passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're already doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set the standard from that lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I've been in a lot of labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this place is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so anyway, I've gotten to see some
really cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, huge, huge cultivations,
huge labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our, you know, our, our spot in
Colorado, where all of our CBD comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: is 1500 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're out just running through
fields and fields of green, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like in a movie or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hard to pinpoint one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, you know, I've been in a so,
so long and we've had so many amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing times, you know, winning high
times cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they took us out to Washington,
DC for the Trailblazers Cup for high
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we took, we were part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just been so many cool things,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was the biggest celebrity you smoked
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, baby bash, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me come back to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get, I was in the rotation,
but I didn't get to hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little bummed about that actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tommy Chong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of, a lot of stuff with
Tommy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you know, all the rappers,
you know, I've smoked with all those guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I can't really pin who, who I think
the biggest one would be without putting
[SPEAKER_02]: them on blast for smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if everyone knows what they
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of them that are big
names, but they may not want me to drop
[SPEAKER_00]: the Michael Phelps of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably now is like, yeah,
I should try to see if he wants
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause somebody dropped them in,
but yeah, gold metal, gold metal Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I mean, you know, all these years
and, and, uh, more specifically since
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012, when the California financing
started, that's when the real fun began
[SPEAKER_02]: and the industry as a whole was a lot of
fun from about 2012 to about, I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: say 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the, the high times cups,
just all the, all the, all the trade shows
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the smokeouts and the sessions and
all the stuff that you used to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: do the hemp cons and the high times and
the blazers cups and all those,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like where the real industry was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you weren't at these events,
I mean, Emerald cup, like we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, if you weren't there,
you, you weren't like, you had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was going on and you had no idea what
you're missing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally missing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best thing we got nowadays is like MJ biz
con, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 4th and 5th of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but the Emerald cups back in the
day were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high times cups in the U S when they
first started, but it was like disco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chalice, all those, like, uh, you know,
I mean, there's been some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: events over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the ones in Europe that still go
on like span of this, which you need
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out span this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember then, uh, COVID hit and I
actually had people from my team landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should come this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that'd be the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, wheezy is probably one of the biggest
names I smoke with this, like totally open
[SPEAKER_02]: with their, with their consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get to smoke with ice cube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to, but that might just be
because I'm 45 and that's, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a legend, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I follow your beads and I mean,
you've gone everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got on some of the biggest stages with
some of the biggest names in rap and hip
[SPEAKER_00]: hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like I said, that's, there's so
many of those cool experiences and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to sound any sort of way,
but I really, it's hard to pinpoint one
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like, Oh gosh, I guess,
uh, we, we, we did a huge one in Vegas and
[SPEAKER_02]: there was like a hundred thousand people
in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the most fun ones for me was,
uh, our, our buddy's show, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Callie roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, I was out there was, I was on stage
with ice cube and I have my little French
[SPEAKER_02]: bulldog with me, you know, Charlie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that was just, that was such a fun
experience being out there and just
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing him, you know, wrap out some of
the songs I grew up on and I was sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: there on stage with them or, you know,
pit bulls and other one, but I didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke with pit bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't really do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how about Mike Tyson?
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke with Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I smoked with Mike in 2006 at the
Doja cup in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike came and I was there and he ended up
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a huge joint that was like that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came over with, he had a plastic
graphics ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I think they gave him the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's another one where like I was
there, but I wasn't like in the rotation
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of missed out on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, one, one thing that was
really cool, um, Collie buds, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: we filmed one of his music videos in my
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was a really cool experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't, you don't have to be on stage
with 150,000 people, just somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 15 of us and this music video is
getting done on someone that you really
[SPEAKER_02]: respect musically that pops up now and
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's in your, you know, it's in your
garage grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, that was, that was really
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was really, really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems like a cool down to earth guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the reggae guys are totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just going to get to that reggae
is kind of unique where they're all kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most artists I hate to say are kind of
dicks, you know, bash is super unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, uh, he has a saying, don't be a,
don't be a dick, take the pic,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause anytime a fan asks him for a
picture, he'll just stop everything and go
[SPEAKER_02]: take the pic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most guys still just walk right by,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was like, you, Rob brought this
bash baby guy over and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents had that CBD shop and a CBD
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they shut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's, it's a tough
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I think you really got to
love it to continue doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, and I hope that number,
I hope I'm wrong about the number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like 90% of everybody's kind of
gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's just, unfortunately
that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones that are around, it's like,
they're, they're the survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who just keep getting
back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're, we're in the epicenter of
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here for, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we, if anyone's a survivor,
it should be us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're the ones that, you know,
kind of fought the fight all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: through to even get to where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think a lot of the ones that
are still here, they wouldn't be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I love doing what I'm doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I think I could do other
stuff, but I choose to do this and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I mean, I don't know if you
guys are eating this food, but this guy
[SPEAKER_02]: can cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a world-class chef right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cooking too, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like cannabis is making a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff I can do in cannabis makes a big
difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like cooking, I can make people
happy and I can make differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives by cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like working with genetics,
the potential of drug discovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the other stuff that is on the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, Hey, I got a breeding book
that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can influence people to make
the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than just making people happy,
which, you know, that makes their world's
[SPEAKER_00]: a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can do something for the masses,
I think that's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like putting products out that
are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another way of making the
world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on some level, what we're doing is
making the world a better place and being
[SPEAKER_00]: a positive impact on society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing that people, some of the
older generation, they look down on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but if you're doing it right,
you're making the world a better place
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding to the community rather than
taking away from the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of smart people in
cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, as you mentioned,
I have a CBD company called Vita Drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the first two years I had Vita
Drops, I had met this oncologist and he
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't know much about CBD, but it had
some questions and we were both tied to
[SPEAKER_02]: 420 evaluations as it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew the old manager there and he just
had some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's like, Hey, ask them,
can you find me someone that knows about
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyway, him and I sit down and a 45
minute conversation turns into a five hour
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're, I'm talking about CBD and what,
you know, what I knew of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how that, you know, kind of contrast
against his, his medical knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And background and fighting cancer and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know what I said,
but I said something enough to convince
[SPEAKER_02]: them to like, okay, I'm going to look more
into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that led to is for the first two
years of my brand being out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: not already been doing CBD stuff with
Revivid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me my start essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a lot of stuff for their
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that turned into me having my own
brand, which was powered by Revivid and
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole farm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so I already knew a lot about CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyway, I started working with him
and for two years I'm working with him and
[SPEAKER_02]: his patients and as a cancer doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm sitting down with families of
people who are either in a stage one or on
[SPEAKER_02]: the last legs of their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether it was a CBD or was the
other therapies, the other stuff that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were doing, I was taking part in these,
these people's therapies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I, I'm happy to say that only
only of the two years I was working with
[SPEAKER_02]: him, only two of the people actually
passed away that he was working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them though was so far progressed
in his, in his cancer that there was just
[SPEAKER_02]: no coming back, but we were at least able
to give him some quality of life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some, some time to not be in
pain at those last, those last months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hard to talk about,
cause you know, you watch, you get to know
[SPEAKER_02]: a family who their, their, their father,
their daughter, their mother's dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You become kind of close to that family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that person in their last days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was really difficult to
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like so valuable for, in terms of he,
the guy in Ray in particular is the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: who I'm, who I'm thinking about when I'm
talking about this beautiful wife and
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful daughter and a beautiful family.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was a triathlete.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing these sub board races across
Lake Tahoe, taking second place competing
[SPEAKER_02]: against like 19 and 20 year olds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was an animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not again, he'd lived his life
perfectly, but ended up with this form of
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer that started down in his lower
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of spread, spread upwards instead
of downwards, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and by the time he'd gone to,
he was from Southern California and they
[SPEAKER_02]: sent him up here at Stanford hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what the doctors told him
was, Hey, look, we've kind of done all we
[SPEAKER_02]: can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't, we're going to keep,
keep doing these therapies on you,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe find some CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear some things about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd given him like three weeks to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not it was a CBD or they were
just off on their clock, we kept them
[SPEAKER_02]: going for a handful of months.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it gave him some quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was able to get some food down.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was able to sleep through the night
without waking up a hundred times in pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave him some quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very extreme version,
but all the way down to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to people who are just using it for basic
pain, inflammation, anti-convulsion
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a plethora of things I've seen it
work on myself with my own eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I keep the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD thing going, even though it's not
super profitable, you know, it's not,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not about the money with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about giving people quality of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I still do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've dumped money into the company to make
sure it keeps going because I want to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that people have access to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of what you're talking about,
like kind of changing the world for the
[SPEAKER_02]: better and giving people quality of life,
making people happy cannabis is that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: that in a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I 1,000% agree with you that,
that you have a platform and guys like us
[SPEAKER_02]: who have fought this out and really know
what the plant is capable of doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the opportunity to make the world
a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our obligation to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like we're stewards of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have this one opportunity now,
you know, we have corporate America coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in to cannabis wanting to sell the steak
and lobster dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the whole medicine side
of it and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's our job to get the story
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, obviously there's the
extreme medical side for people like with
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer and there's nothing wrong with the
people that are using it for recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Dennis Perrone said it's medical,
whether you know it is or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's absolute truth to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people that use it
recreationally, it benefits them
[SPEAKER_00]: medically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's just say life's a bitch,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people suffer from anxiety and
they've got pain and they've got stress
[SPEAKER_02]: and they say the number one killer is
heart disease, heart attacks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what contributes to
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, people drink alcohol,
people use illicit drugs, people use
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do all these things to kind of offset
the stress that they have in their life,
[SPEAKER_02]: but those are actually compounding the
things that are killing them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas cannabis is something that can
alleviate the anxiety and stress and pain
[SPEAKER_02]: and all these things, you know,
in a healthy way with very little side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects, you know, maybe gaining a little
weight from the munchies or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeping too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not killing people, you're killing
cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it doesn't cause lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helps to fight those cancers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we're just scratching the
surface of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much potential with
this plant and we're going to find out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot over the next five to 10 years,
all the medical side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they start really being able to
analyze it and study it properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: once it goes off of regulation,
whether it's de-scheduled or re-scheduled,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would love for it to be
de-scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the right decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we have alcohol and we have
tobacco, those are de-scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason to schedule it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even schedule it like aspirin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a control thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Control the dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we had to wait so long is
because they recognize the value of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it poses a threat to pharma, poses a
threat to timber, poses a threat to
[SPEAKER_02]: cotton, poses a threat to the major
industries that built America and the
[SPEAKER_02]: magnus of those industries are like,
I'll put this half a billion aside just to
[SPEAKER_02]: lobby against this as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the people are realizing that it's
not the devil's lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make crazed Negroes rape white
women.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what they said back in the 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at a time where information freely
flows and we know that these aren't facts
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough people have used cannabis to know
that the worst thing that comes of it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: cheeseburger attack at 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't, there's nothing bad for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their fight is in vain at this point
because they know they either get on board
[SPEAKER_02]: or lose much money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you had one piece of advice
for your younger self that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting off in the industry, what would
that one piece be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust nobody in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, my younger, the younger version of
myself, I would probably tell him to stick
[SPEAKER_02]: with one thing and run with it,
you know, because I because the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: was so wild, wild west that, you know,
I used to actually preach this.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, I would tell people
like, oh, you know, if if you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the auto industry, you focus on
your one craft and you perfect that craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a jack of all trades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus on one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, as these years have come
along, like there are so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities in cannabis, right,
that I I squirreled off on all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a software company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a software.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you you were definitely spread
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think part of the thing is,
is with cannabis, when you're doing it at
[SPEAKER_00]: your house, in your garage, in your
closet, whatever, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to do it right, you have to be
the constructor and the production guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be the electrician.
[SPEAKER_02]: The HVAC specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be the HVAC guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a roof yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be, you know, and then you
want your your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all of the the the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you had to be extract artist on
top of that, you know, because I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We blast tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old school with Micah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like we had the tables that we were
blasting tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, you know, this is,
yeah, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but we had to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the beauty of the
regulated market, too, is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really stay in your lane now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really be a specialist and get you
almost have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to whatever you're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be the best at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be better than a thousand
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can do that, you're going to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be like one in 100,
like the 99 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're better than them,
you're usually OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's almost like you want to be better
than a thousand other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, like, if I had to stay with the
software, I mean, I've no offense to
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone listening as part of one of these
canvas software companies, but I've played
[SPEAKER_02]: with all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so overly complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: These systems just built to run like
chains of Safeways with a million products
[SPEAKER_02]: and not like a real realistic dispensary
shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we designed our system to be user
friendly and be kind of all encompassing
[SPEAKER_02]: for the whole business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a dispensary owner, it was easy for
me to design this because I knew what my
[SPEAKER_02]: needs were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew what I had to get to get people in
the door and out the door and that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: process and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we built the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we built it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, we built it for stoners
to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For our operators to be stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the other companies,
I won't drop their names.
[SPEAKER_02]: They built it for engineers to operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so had I stuck with that, we'd be like
the standard in the whole country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had I stuck with California finance and we
hadn't had the issues that we had in the
[SPEAKER_02]: in the end of it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have been, you know, we'd have been
the number one in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just certain things that I did
along the way that kind of shot me in
[SPEAKER_02]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really wish that I had maybe stayed
focused on one thing at a time and saw it
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would tell my younger self,
find that one thing and do it and do it
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a good one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig myself a little bit, but I think
we're back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing pretty good,
but I've never seen you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do something for a few
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've always had commitment to everything
you've done growing cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you grew a lot of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I still have some photos of your
cookies from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, please send those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three where there was the three nugs
side by side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that some of my J1,
which is another one I really love to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: that somehow met you in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ended up there and you ended up
with your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you ended up in the cup out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was actually a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the J1 and yeah, that was a good,
that was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The J1, the J1 bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the funny thing is, is like,
when you think of Jack Herrera today,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people think of Jack Herrera is this
thing that's not that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing that tastes okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real Jack, if you get to
experience the real Jack, it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just limonene and turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not just a very linear thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, you know, and it's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was strong flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just cause you didn't try the real
Jack doesn't mean the real Jack wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many people get, and same thing
with blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of people have tried
some inferior blue dream, but the real
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream, it tasted really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked good, smoked good at everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked it for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the one strain that I didn't get
immune to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it kept working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, J1, I loved it, but after about a
month of smoking it, like it didn't work
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get immune to it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of strains I get immune to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush, headband, we had the headband
back in the day and that shit was strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice chunky nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chunky nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would get you super ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of PM problems with that one though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of those ones, it was
gassed down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there was, there was a,
but the slew of different things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: grew over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were all really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went through phases with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cookies was just the phase of one
of many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it all started with, for me with the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got the cookies, I was like,
oh man, now it's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went polar opposite though,
as far as structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like Skittles and cookies have
the, you know, I mean, Thin Mints has a
[SPEAKER_00]: good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but as far as like, I mean,
I guess Skittles is a step down structure
[SPEAKER_00]: wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for as good as Skittles tastes
and how blasted it gets you, it really is
[SPEAKER_02]: an ugly plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it has a ceiling, but I love
the effect of it, but it definitely tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely amazing, but it is an ugly
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ran into Mendo Tone out at MJ
Biz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to that after party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Seedless?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember whose after party it was,
but yeah, I ran into him out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We caught up for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't seen him in years and he gave me
a stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he had a pre-roll there and it
was a Skittles pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, is this the original one?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I lit that thing up and that
stole about a half of a day from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was a good cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Terps for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I like Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chase flavor constantly chasing
different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so what are your thoughts of all
these gelato crosses where everything has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, like I said, I'm a blue dream guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back in the day, there was a
couple of strains that were purple and we
[SPEAKER_02]: thought that was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granddaddy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lavender, granddaddy, purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one of those sativa dominant
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember which one that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they called it black pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was black pearl pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was black Cadillac or purple
Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mendo cough, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we look at cannabis as,
you know, a flavor profile and an effect
[SPEAKER_02]: and what's the highlight and what does it
do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the market just said purple candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't give a shit about anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was purple and if it had a candy
nose, they didn't care what the name was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, as a purist, it's like
offensive, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I just showed you the most
amazing bag of what's actually really good
[SPEAKER_02]: quality weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you took this two steps down thing
because it was purple and candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff doesn't get, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bottlenecked the industry into purple
candy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this big array of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everyone got fixated on this and
those became the qualifiers that checked
[SPEAKER_00]: the boxes for a lot of people,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of it has its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, if it tastes good, it tastes good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much good stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even like Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not the biggest, it's not my
favorite, but I do like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked with lemon tree for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lemon tree, I feel like lemon tree is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's got gas and lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got like a nice dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got it's turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's heavy turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: All turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You taste it in your mouth long after the
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Crockett on here talking about
Tangy and the real Tangy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's he doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen him in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crockett, his son, he came on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about strawberry banana
and Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to smoke some of their
strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got some of that recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some, it's light debt, but I have
some strawberry banana right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good washer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to wash well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that good yield, that good return
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you see the industry in 10
years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in all honesty, my heart,
like I said, our whole, our whole thing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now is, is hoping that we can
achieve as much shelf space and enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me, enough brand recognition that
we're here in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And five years ago, I would have said that
we can do that by our own means.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now with where we're at, I'm fearful
that it's going to be a overly
[SPEAKER_02]: commercialized, overly regulated national
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once everyone and their mother jumps
in from a corporate standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to get ruined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that how it ends up,
there's room for like a kind of winery
[SPEAKER_02]: model, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you have boutique stuff,
you have boutique wineries and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: your Charles Shaw's, you have your two
buck Chuck, and you've got your $60 bottle
[SPEAKER_02]: of growth or whatever you're into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that it's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that it will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that everything that we've fought
for, for all these years is going to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the wayside and the market is going to
dictate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that with the money,
you know, the big companies that come in
[SPEAKER_02]: and fucking destroy everybody or by
everybody are going to dictate how it
[SPEAKER_02]: moves, you know, similar to any other
commodity that's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could say I saw rainbows and
butterflies, but I just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: See bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not a pessimist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a glass half full kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality of the situation is the
second that Pfizer has anything to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or even Metta or Google or Ford
Motor Company or any of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Pfizer's already got their hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to get ruined,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I don't mean to be dismal,
but 10 years, I think five years,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still going to be, you know,
it's still going to be in a good place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the longer that goes, that it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they'd have the vaccine and the cure
for COVID.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you said disco at this time,
but it'll never be disco again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 2012, 2018 were the best years in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything past that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, you've been we've been
talking about this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that era, 2012 to 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'm hearing stories from Steve D
'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hearing stories from Rick DeLisi,
Uncle Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, I feel like the 60s were the that
was the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and each one of those guys,
Rick, he was smuggling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's smuggling 10 tons on boats and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 10 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there was that day in
that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to be alive back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things led up to it being legal
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people want to shun him or
these guys that did prison and like say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these smugglers and these guys
were bad for selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be around today if it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paved the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not us, but the entire legal
industry is thanks to these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They broke the law that ended up doing
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up pushing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and some people call
them outlaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, you know, if you look a
hundred years in the future, a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: years in the past, they'd say,
no, man, it's, it's not the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were messing around with weed that were
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everybody else that was looking at
it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know those guys are definitely the ones
that paved the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1996 could even happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I knew Dennis, I can say,
I know I met him a number of times and
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis Perrone is a champion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, God rest his soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it weren't for guys like him and guys
like, there's so many, so many that are
[SPEAKER_00]: gone too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's why I love the
podcast to be able to capture these types
[SPEAKER_00]: of stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many special people,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many stories that haven't
been told or that never will be told
[SPEAKER_00]: because the people have passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like Simon and Arion and
Franco from strain hunters, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: storytellers as well in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but also telling the story of like
all these different regions and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people hate on them for it, but really,
I mean, they're, they're doing an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Documenting places where most people
wouldn't even go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Franco rest, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Franco was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, he's lucky that he was able
to tell his story through those channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I, my breeding books
dedicated Franco.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed in Africa, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe he passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did pass from, from, uh, his trip to
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a cerebral meningitis in 2017 and
passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put it all on the line for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you go to some of these places in
the world and, you know, we're used,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, we're used to like, no matter what
kind of infection you get here,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gone in three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's things that, uh, they exist in
the rest of the world that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: he put it all on the line and he paid the
price and he did what he loved it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: very last day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he loved cannabis more than
anybody I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met a lot of people that love
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversations and the way his eyes would
light up, uh, you know, unparalleled to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the term passion for the sacred plant,
the hashtag that I used for the last,
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2012, since hashtags even were
created, uh, is thanks to Franco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and I were sitting down and I said it
and he's like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so yeah, rest in peace,
Franco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, uh, without people,
these pioneers, you know, that have come
[SPEAKER_00]: before us, we wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just so many of them and so
many stories that haven't been told.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, so that's, that's kind of a
problem because those are the real
[SPEAKER_02]: pioneers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we call ourselves pioneers lightly,
but that's because we're, we operated in
[SPEAKER_02]: the, in the space that they created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're standing on the shoulders of
giants, but we are in our own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pioneers, you know, in a different way,
but yeah, I mean, we're standing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of the guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said really did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you when it was really illegal and
they were looking at serious time and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and I mean, it's really sad that we
ever got to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never should have been illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cannabis never should have been illegal
hemp, especially hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a joke that hemp was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, it's a big threat to
cotton paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand the reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any sense in you and you think
that hemp should be illegal, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have sense because it doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hemp is such a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remediates the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically gives it's way better than
trees for paper and for so many other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting it, you know, it puts a lot
of oxygen back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to cotton, it's wild because the
hemp shirts last so much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp fabrics last so much longer than
cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make them just as soft and they
last three times, four times long.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm a, I'm a big, I love hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, we're blessed to be able to be in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've known you for a long time
and it's pretty wild that we're both still
[SPEAKER_00]: here because so many of our friends that
were in it are no longer in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, out of the 40 or 50 mutual
friends, there's maybe a handful of us
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is sad because it's been such a,
it's been such a fun, wild ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were always the hard headed
ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to like take me out and get me to
quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's looking to get a hold of
you, they want to find your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the best place to go online?
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently it's Instagram at the Rio West
coast, Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're creating a THC a line page on the
Vita drops USA website, vidadropsusa.com
[SPEAKER_02]: full line of really high quality,
organic USDA certified CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to add our a line on there
because one, we want to get more eyeballs
[SPEAKER_02]: on the CBD because we, because of how
valuable it is and how, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people, people need it in their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to host a, host a home for,
you know, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the THC, but yeah, the Rio West coast,
Kana I, me personally is Rob Quintero one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my Instagram handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we get back to you really
quick and we have good customer service
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're starting to do a lot of
different shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting, we're getting back out
there because the past couple of years has
[SPEAKER_02]: been rough as, as you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're, we're, we're hitting the
ground running and we're, we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the THC a line, we've got a lot of
people, um, that are getting involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lab pack, Jay, big smokey
farmers are doing a nice collab with him
[SPEAKER_02]: on some pre-rolls, some vape cards,
some pre-packaged flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a numb honey, you know, an upright.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we're doing one of his lumpias,
uh, with a THC a flower inside and some
[SPEAKER_02]: diamonds.
