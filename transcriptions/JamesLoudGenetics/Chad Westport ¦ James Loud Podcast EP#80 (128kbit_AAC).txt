[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, our special guest is none other
than the famous Chad Westport from
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have known each other online for four
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were there at the very beginning of my
podcast journey on the Future Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: Project.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great source of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been happy to be along for the
ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad to see this new iteration of
it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take off as it has.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you spent a lot of time on podcasts,
because not only on my podcast,
[SPEAKER_05]: but everyone else's podcasts and shows on
the Future Cannabis Project, you were
[SPEAKER_05]: always in the chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would jump in and you would be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've always been a big supporter of
the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before you had a podcast, I remember
saying, Chad, you should probably have
[SPEAKER_05]: your own podcast, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're really good at this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you have your own podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're doing big things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, hanging out in the chat was
fun because that's where the kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community is built.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we learn so much from each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we meet new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a great audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's always fun hanging out in
the chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the show is built around
greatness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides myself, I think our guests are
amazing and our producer, the guy who
[SPEAKER_05]: produces the show, he does an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our client base, the people that
watch the show, they really bring a lot to
[SPEAKER_05]: the chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the ones, the guests come on the
show to be able to talk to them and to get
[SPEAKER_05]: their stories out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've had some amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just a catalyst for this whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, at the end of the day,
as podcast hosts, it's not about us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be the James Ladd podcast or the
Chad Westport podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever the James Ladd show.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, our job is to be able to help
the guests tell their story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the beauty of the podcast is we
get to hear these.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get to hear in the first person,
get to talk to these people and they get
[SPEAKER_05]: to tell me their amazing stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm excited to tell your amazing
story today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun to have a front row seat
as the podcast host to be able to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: your hand and get the question anytime you
want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always say I have a front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like freestyle, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't record questions and give
questions out beforehand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did that with the Future Cannabis
Project.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I did the James Ladd show,
I'd give them some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what happened was I would realize that
I would ask them six or eight questions
[SPEAKER_05]: and it would go way off topic almost every
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the science guys loved that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like when it's just fresh and
off the cuff, it's just so much more fun
[SPEAKER_05]: and enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like the conversation can go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, it's like the Grateful Dead
when they're jamming, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we're jamming like the
Grateful Dead jams.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like it's innovation and it's all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the conversation can go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're telling a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a thought of what cannabis
brings though, is really kind of a vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really has kind of brought
together a lot of people that probably
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have hung out normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of joke too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like younger generation will never
know what the dealers count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's where, you know,
you met people from like different schools
[SPEAKER_01]: or different areas and different walks of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it is the plant brings us
together, but it's all that vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool to see it translate into the
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all, everything circles back for
me, everything circles back to genetics,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm a genetics focused person and
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all everything we do, whether it's my
book, whether it's the podcast,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's our clothing line,
it all circles back to genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's our responsibility as
stewards to, you know, as podcast hosts,
[SPEAKER_05]: to highlight people that have experience
with the plant and share their experiences
[SPEAKER_05]: with the world, with the future,
the people that are watching this show 50
[SPEAKER_05]: years from now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we talk about, I talk about that
quite a bit on my show, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: about the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the importance of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love interviewing other podcast
hosts because they know how to talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know how to have great conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm, I'm glad you're here and to
sometimes a normal conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to my wife and she always cuts me
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, sweetie, you need to start a
podcast because you'll learn how to talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you really do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think even the way I project my
voice is different than the first episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first was doing podcasts,
I feel like I know how to speak better,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a strange thing, but I,
you know, I, I, I know how to conversate
[SPEAKER_05]: better for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm, I've always been good at letting
people talk and not interrupting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been good at letting people
interact over some, some podcast hosts,
[SPEAKER_05]: not naming any names, but some of them
love to interrupt and talk over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it is what it is,
but you get, you get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: everything with different podcasts and
different podcast hosts, but I really want
[SPEAKER_05]: to hear the story from the guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also, well, they're telling their
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, man, what should I ask them
next?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what gets me excited too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, man, so I learned this about this
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you write the questions before,
you don't get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like you can go in the middle and
you're like, Whoa, I want to know more
[SPEAKER_05]: about this person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you can always ask them,
well, when did you first start smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like generic, generic stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes you need to do that to get
into some of the deep stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we've gotten to some really
cool stuff on this show.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think you, you liked our
Christmas special so much that you want a
[SPEAKER_01]: hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought it all the way back with me
because I want to hand this hat over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to you to wear again this December
and give out some more gifts to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the person that wins next year
or this year will be on your show next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be auctioning this off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has some hair from Chad in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa's hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the original one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to just keep this
thing going.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some stuff exciting going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: For Christmas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some big projects that I'm going to
be working on for the next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some big breeding projects with SF Kana
and Planta.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: With both of those companies, we're doing
some projects and then my buddy's company
[SPEAKER_05]: Hushle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm doing some reversals and sharing
pollen and pollinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think 2025 is going to be a
pretty freaking amazing year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to set yourself up this year for
the busyness of next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm always trying to set myself up
for the success of the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you're not planning ahead,
then you're behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, talking genetics and breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many years ahead are you in
your head right now as far as what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we do so much more work than we
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do like, let's say we just do 300
out-crosses a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can only test a small percentage of
those, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: To properly test them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing testing them and just,
oh yeah, we pop one of each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We pop 10 of each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to actually pop them, grow them out
multiple times and go, this is the winner
[SPEAKER_05]: from this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the winner from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have time to do all the work that
we do every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each year we get backlogged a little
more, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can always go back and revisit that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We store seeds correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to spend time at the facility
today at the Oakland facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I walked into a
warm, just dank smelling room full of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that I used to do,
but I haven't done for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really cool to see that the way
that you have it set up, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm primarily like a home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Home growers is where I spend the majority
of my focus, the majority of my attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be doing things different
when you have a larger space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always fun to come in and see
what is being done, how it's being done,
[SPEAKER_01]: what plants look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much working commercially of
just how to handle plants in itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to come in and see a
facility like this is great because in my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind, I'm always like, how can something
that I see here apply?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can it help somebody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we get a lot of the
information we learn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we put you to work today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going sexing plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in that stage of the phenohunt where
literally we're going in and trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: pull out all the males from the regular
seeds and observing traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking for stuff that's also stuff
that's taken off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got really tall plants and really short
plants and trying to determine what's what
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an exciting time going,
stuff going into flower because it all
[SPEAKER_05]: goes into flower at different days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's triggered on the same
day, you know, the light is triggered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't mean that that plant will actually
go into flower two or three days later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them it's a week later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it's 10 days later before you're
really able to properly sex them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like some of it is with the stability
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are longer flying varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just take longer to show their signs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and then, you know, we're looking for
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the next thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going through those rooms every
day, pulling males.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found some real, we found a Zotti male
today that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Leo Stone of Fishnado
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leo's a bad ass and I love his genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a male that looks pretty killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the structure is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the stem rub was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, kind of just going through the room
and looking at some of them because there
[SPEAKER_01]: were, there was the observable traits of
some just weren't there yet while others
[SPEAKER_01]: were fully letting you know what they
were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them that are really unstable,
you'll get 20 plants that all look
[SPEAKER_05]: different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some stuff, they look identical across
the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those, and those plants are all
really healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like you can keep your plants
really healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow them properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best way to make them express.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they show different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that just grow mediocre,
they have a problem getting the plants to
[SPEAKER_05]: express properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's really, the phenohunt is that
much harder when you're not able to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: the plants really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of varieties out there
that, you know, I've heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't grow it right, you're not
going to think it's the real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that's sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, you know, they,
they, they rush to work with something
[SPEAKER_01]: before they get good at growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you're ever trying to do
any kind of selections, you really have to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that growing part down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to the end picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, there's some, so many guys
that want to be breeders and they just
[SPEAKER_05]: want to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, man, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Making seeds is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think everybody should do it,
but I also think it's more important to be
[SPEAKER_05]: a good grower and cultivator than it is to
be a seed producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you'll be a better seed producer and
grower and breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know how to make the plant express
really well, you understand plant health,
[SPEAKER_05]: optimal plant health, how to keep your
plants healthy all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then drawing and curing that's so
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have those things,
how are you really going to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: pheno hunt?
[SPEAKER_05]: So building up those skills and then
breeding should just be a natural
[SPEAKER_05]: transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it shouldn't be like,
I need to learn how to breed so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a lot of that you learn on the
cultivation side when you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's, it's a trip though, cause I
think people get excited about breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're like, Oh, I want to be a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's not as glamorous.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of stuff also seems very glamorous
from the outside and you're like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, these guys are doing this,
this or that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of it boils down to,
do you really like data collection?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really like examining plants and
comparing and taking notes?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're doing at the end of the day,
you're doing a lot of AB testing and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're like, okay, is this better than
this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And why is it better than this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you, you know, so it's not just,
Oh, I found the next winner and I'm going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's like, that philosophy is kind
of gone anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see more people now that it's kind of
shaken out that there's more people
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to put in the work, willing to,
to recognize the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you mentioned data collection too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like on a small scale,
craft scale, homescale, tent scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to work with observable traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're pheno hunting, it's like,
was it a heavy feeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it like water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, if we were bigger,
we could use things like SAP analysis and
[SPEAKER_01]: soil analysis to really determine,
is it truly a heavy feeder and what
[SPEAKER_01]: particular is it heavy in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can just throw all those tests
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause at the end of the day, the effect
and the taste are the two most important
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can have data that backs up those
things, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have, you can have COAs and you
get lab results for cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can, you can find a lot of things
from lab analysis, but at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day, it's not going to tell you how it
makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not going to fully tell you
exactly how it tastes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know that terpenes in the brain
percentage is five and a half percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: But does that mean anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that translate into?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more you know your breeding lines,
the better, obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the more you work with those
same plants and you breed them together,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going like, yeah, the mother's if
I, if you use this as a donor,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I use this as a receiver,
it's probably going to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually it's a probably because you
never know with recessive and dominant
[SPEAKER_05]: traits, unless you know both sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're like, yeah, this is going
to be the outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, it gets more predictable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more that you understand the lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the less guessing you have to do,
which is kind of great because a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people are like, well, what is GMO times
Donnie burger going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, well, you're going to lean
more heavy on that GMO, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's going to go more into that
chem D GMO gassy side, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already kind of gassy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've been talking about this
show quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually had that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm huge into the extract flora
and flame.
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave me some and changed my mind
completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me some flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't impressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me the extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like some of the best I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that sometimes that changes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the concentration, I almost
think like the isolation of things can
[SPEAKER_01]: bring out the different nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're, you're talking about the
effect being the most important thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: that usually that comes after the fact
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you've, you have to grow at
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be like, is this one worth
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this one desirable?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should be growing a plant multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you already know those things and then
you have the effect too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm initially trying to look at
something, I, I'll get preconceived
[SPEAKER_01]: notion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's kind of a beast to grow,
I don't really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not going to taste as good to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like trying not to have too much
of an opinion on those things until I
[SPEAKER_05]: taste them or, you know, I think there's
when you're, when you're doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're working with 500 plants,
there's also the commercial viability
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something that, cause that's why
I'm doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to license them to sell clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's this going to perform for my friends
or the people I want to sell a clone to or
[SPEAKER_05]: license a clone to?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so there's that, we get to get
rid of some of the stuff that are just
[SPEAKER_05]: runty, but every once in a while I'll find
some little runty plant and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, we're going to keep this for breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we're not going to ever sell this to
anybody, but I love the way this tastes or
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the way this smells.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll save that stuff for something
special, but then its purpose is really
[SPEAKER_05]: for the breeding, you know, and there's
some stuff that's a real big yielder or
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's a super fast finisher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it's amazing for the,
that trait, that specific trait,
[SPEAKER_05]: it finishes really fast, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So has this amazing quality finishes in 45
days done yields three pounds per four by
[SPEAKER_05]: four gets purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but, but it's missing something,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean you need a throw it
away because it's missing something.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that maybe you could breed it
with other stuff to potentially,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, especially other fast finishers,
uh, and especially if you get high
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids, you know, there's,
there's so many things that maybe they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't fit into the model, but they still
have uses.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still have purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you have, you know,
like five to six or 700 plants in a
[SPEAKER_05]: phenome, you're going to find a lot of
good stuff and a lot of interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: and a lot of stuff you think is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not, so I see that a lot where I'm
like, Ooh, I get excited about something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, personal opinions too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the, some of my favorite things
that I've had, um, it's not the first jar
[SPEAKER_01]: that's empty out of some of the things
that I put on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all subjective as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The jar test is always the true,
it's the best test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it'll break your heart,
but it's the best test.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, it's like with my friends too,
it's like, which ones are they coming back
[SPEAKER_05]: for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which are, which ones are the,
which ones everybody asking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us a little bit about some of the
breeding projects you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I am just in the infancy,
as we all know, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for years I've been working on just
like selecting something that I really
[SPEAKER_01]: liked, something that works with my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, something that's nice to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned commercial viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be able, I know, I know that
if I find something that works great for
[SPEAKER_01]: my body, it's going to help other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, that's just the real intent
behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, I've found the ones that I like
some things that help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'm sure as anybody in
breeding will tell you, don't work with a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that you don't absolutely love
because you're going to be working with it
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working on selecting things
that work for my palate and then slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the Westport grape juice to
try that against a variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things, to see how that expresses,
to see what is consistently coming over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes what gets buried in the infancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really honing in on those right now
to put that forward in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a few more years, hopefully I'll
have it more dialed, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: right now that's, that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, these things are long-term projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not instant gratification and that's,
that's why you get so much gratification
[SPEAKER_05]: out of them when they go well is because
it's a lot of these projects take a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you've been working on the,
uh, Westport grape juice for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For at least three years that you can
document.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's, you know, it's another
really fun aspect to me is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you're so familiar with the
plant and you do, make seeds with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to look at the offspring,
you're like, Oh, instantly that is you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Oh, that is you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a fun part of it for me too,
because ultimately with selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll help you get back to what you're
trying to really get to feeling like
[SPEAKER_05]: you're part of the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is like that too, because you're
like, Oh, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause this is kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I'm not seeing this from either one of
the parents and all of a sudden we got
[SPEAKER_05]: this weird plant or today we found a
really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found in a feminized seed lot,
we found a male plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of a progeny of feminized seeds,
there was a full male and it was my ZBX
[SPEAKER_05]: times rape gas.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's the first time I've seen
that in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nature will find a way though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nature will find a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it pollen that came in on someone's
shirt or who knows, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: send the test over to my flora and they're
going to sex test it for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll look at the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to get those results and let
you know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's, you know, it's like,
I'm glad we caught that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause if it was all feminized seeds,
I wouldn't be as worried right now in the
[SPEAKER_05]: stage we're in to look for males.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be more looking for herms in the next
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But because there are males in the room,
I go through every plant and we sex every
[SPEAKER_05]: day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going through there and trying to
find signs of males.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that part too, because then you
really get to know your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do again, hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that the farmer shadow is the
best nutrient a plant can receive?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm butchering that, but that is,
that is something, something along the
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, but it is totally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's the more plants you
have, the harder it is, but it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely possible to get in there every
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the more you put in, the more you get
out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you don't spend enough time,
you might have time for other things and
[SPEAKER_05]: then you neglect your room.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what happens is if you have a male and
you have a 20 or 30 light room,
[SPEAKER_05]: you are going to have a lot of seeds,
a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe you'll get some interesting
stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, you know, maybe, but also when
you're pheno hunting, it's really hard to,
[SPEAKER_05]: to say that this is the expression that
I'm going to get when the plants not
[SPEAKER_05]: seeded, because that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a different expression from seeded
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I've, I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't conclusively say myself,
but yeah, you know, I've kind of heard
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go back to some of the things that
pop out, I did an S one or reversal on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Westport grape juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there there's a tuck leaf pheno.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you typically got your lease
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consistent along that particular
style, all gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now where that comes from in the Westport
grape juice, it's not present in the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, again, going back with the S one,
that was kind of fun because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: things that popped out there and like,
okay, well, that's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love, I love seeing recessive traits
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love proving myself wrong or proving
myself right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was, that was fun,
but that was kind of a, kind of a one and
[SPEAKER_01]: done, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like males have a lot more pollen,
damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do, but I can really get a ton of
pollen out of my, my females, my
[SPEAKER_05]: reversals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you guys, most people have seen my
reversals online and we are our reversals
[SPEAKER_05]: dump.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's a genetic thing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't expect me to get those reversals
on SFV or a handful of other things,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, but on the typical plant,
I can reverse them and get a jars of
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen per plant.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was probably going to ask
about what you use and the ratios and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's proprietary, but do you
think it comes down to a lot of the mix
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using versus genetics or
environment or health?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, yeah, you're interviewing me
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so with, with silver, when you're
using ethylene blockers, there's several
[SPEAKER_05]: silvers that work colloidal silver will
work true colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in my book too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we go into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I use nano silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from my friend, Tim Humiston can
organics really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It, I think it's the most effective and I
have the best results on stuff that
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't reverse really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it pretty much reverses everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's single spray one and done boom,
boom, boom STS.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to spray a few times,
but you damage the planet damage the
[SPEAKER_05]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those plants look like death afterwards,
like they're damaged.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't particularly like STS,
but STS works really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still use it in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think it's the standard for people
that make feminized seeds, but I do like
[SPEAKER_05]: the nano silver the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one milliliter per gallon
stabilized shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a gallon of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can sit for the week that you're using
it for reversals.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really good and easy to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, I mean, there's even silver
that you can use in your, your feed and
[SPEAKER_05]: you can put it in the roots and then the
roots will update.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it and, uh, yeah, you can get
reversals like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds of different ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many different ways to skin a
cat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all what you prefer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that you need to test it out
before you sign off on it to do a run,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's a one light run or a 50 light
run, you should have experience,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably have a backup plan in case your
reversal doesn't go quite as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make pollen in advance, plus have fresh
pollen and those combinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's always good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Redundancies are good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen the building.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have redundancies here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, we got the dosage on
one side and we're putting the agri-tech,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, irrigation skid up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm super excited with that dosing
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and then we'll be able to do those
tests, but also that's a redundancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if our dosing system goes out
or a dose of time goes out for the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can switch it over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're instantly switched over to
agri-tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with, uh, you didn't get to see
the controls in the room, but we use grow
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan gross sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we use the agri-tech system and we're
determining, uh, the root zone temperature
[SPEAKER_05]: with the gross sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas like we can get environmental from
both and then compare and go, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, why is it this way or why is it that
way?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_05]: It gives us a better picture of the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if one fails, it's the fail safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always go back to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yeah, it's, it's well, and it's a
fun project, but it's like, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of moving parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally with those types of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is fun that you, you know,
I like the A and B mindset as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
we're trying to get to the best path
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and if I can figure the best way to
do something that I can empower a customer
[SPEAKER_05]: to get better results, I'm winning.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're winning and by them winning,
they're going to buy seeds for me or
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can tell somebody the optimal way to
get the best results from what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing, whether it be lighting spectrum
under canopy, how valuable is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing some tests right now with the
favins.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing the favins with light lifts
and we're doing for seed production,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also do doing it for flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really like under canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the plant health plant vigor also do
less work, but I feel like the plants just
[SPEAKER_05]: look healthier and the bottoms and
undercarriage that don't get enough light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all of a sudden you get a lot of light
down there and you get bigger yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I'm about to interview again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but I'll just cut to saying
like, yeah, this is the first run where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm experimenting with some sidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, under lighting as well just cause
I, I typically all lollipop pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get rid of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody likes to trim larve.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean the future's bright
literally, especially with under canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big shout out to Favin and all the guys
that are doing under canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Favin's who I use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Favin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, and then we got bug lights
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you saw the episode with a
grand master LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're, they're sending some bug
lights out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be doing an R and D with
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think there's so much potential and
we're just now tapping into some of this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, the potential for bug lights
that'll kill spider mites or help control
[SPEAKER_05]: spider mites and thrips.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you not want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It, you know, that sounds handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a few years ago,
um, a ring light that the guy would say
[SPEAKER_01]: you put on top of your bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he said it was all proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't tell you how it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to run at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a lot of questions about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I remember getting it,
getting poo pooed because there were a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of logical questions of like, well,
how close does it have to be to these bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: to affect them?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the duration?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that seems to now actually be being,
getting vetted out to something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really a practical system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thomas that was on a show, a grand master
level Thomas, he's a, he's an OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, I mean, I'll tell you how the
lights work when I use them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to test them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the potential for it and UVC
and all these different things are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, you don't use it for that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact is, is if I don't ever have
to spray my plants, that's the best IPM
[SPEAKER_05]: ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but we, you know, we basically don't
spray because we're a closed loop system
[SPEAKER_05]: until we have to spray, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, hydrogen peroxide, that's,
we'd use a little bit of hydrogen
[SPEAKER_05]: peroxide, but other than the hydrogen
peroxide, we try not to spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to sell sprayed clones if I
don't have to spray them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's part of our IPM regimen and we
find out that we need to do that in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of right now, we're a closed loop
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's from tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything's coming in clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's the game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to always preach like cultural
controls or cultural IPM, because that as,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just like a home grower,
um, it's easier to be, well reactive than
[SPEAKER_01]: proactive larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand proactive because you have a
large investment to take, but I personally
[SPEAKER_01]: would not want to put some things on my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's always what I encourage is,
you know, again, good cultural controls,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, all the things that you've done today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you can get very far with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think ultimately that affects the
outcome of the flower as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not going through as much
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing for hoplite and Veroid is so huge
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And popping seeds anymore, you got to test
all your seed progenies for hoplite and
[SPEAKER_05]: Veroid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you're getting them from
other people, if you know, like we're
[SPEAKER_05]: using tissue culture to make seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So our tissue culture seeds are not going
to have hoplite and Veroid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can guarantee that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's something we will guarantee.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's from tissue culture parents,
from both of them, I will guarantee that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no hoplite in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing we're committed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so starting in 2025, you're going to
see all our seeds are made from tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: culture moms, tissue culture parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so that potentially spreads less
Veroid and virus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's so many other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we just talk about hoplite and
that's one of 50 things that the plant can
[SPEAKER_05]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, ultimately over time that,
that does kind of bring down a crop or
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, destruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, the beast of it is it's not
always immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't necessarily know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how much of this industry is
actually infected with HL, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with hoplite?
[SPEAKER_05]: A huge, more than 75%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we're all still in business
somehow, but we're having to find ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it may express on one limb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may express on one plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may express on one section,
one row or the whole room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until it's stressed out, sometimes it
doesn't express it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so some people are like, well,
I got a beat enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you do until you don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I, so I have a couple of
friends that basically were the ones like,
[SPEAKER_05]: ah, it's not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now my buddy's like, fuck,
we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I got to pay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have 250 things I need cultured or
cleaned, and it's going to cost so much
[SPEAKER_05]: money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those things happen, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you're good until you're
not right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, a lot of people wait
until they're not before they try to
[SPEAKER_05]: resolve the issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the issues are, you know,
it's like, how do I solve the problem?
[SPEAKER_05]: I treat it before it's a problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can do preventative preventative
is worth every, every bit of its weight in
[SPEAKER_05]: gold, especially with hoplite and Viroid
and the potential we have for tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: culture and banking and tissue culture,
and to be able to grow your moms from
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of people like tissue
culture, this tissue culture, that talking
[SPEAKER_05]: negatively about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear some of those people now,
but it's like, they're not seeing the
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, we're talking about virus and
Viroid prevention.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can not have it in your system
at all, if you have a closed loop
[SPEAKER_05]: facility, you're never going to have those
problems, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have those problems,
you're not going to lose the money that
[SPEAKER_05]: you would have if you had those problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every day the product gets cheaper and
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to empower, because we're
a genetics company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't cultivate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cultivate seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cultivate for seed production and for
phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work with people that produce flour,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that's a really, the flour side,
the cultivation side is much harder to
[SPEAKER_05]: monetize these days, unless you already
have an established brand or you create
[SPEAKER_05]: the best of the best flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in competition with so many other
people that are producing pretty good
[SPEAKER_05]: flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the price is so cheap that they can
charge so little.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see a lot of people struggling on
that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word craft has always been tossed
around for as long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just kind of small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a while, that seemed to be where
some of the quality was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them, at least in Washington,
seem to be bought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still ones that exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of large players.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully, if we do go federally
legal, or at least the gates are open,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that's kind of like the return to
the craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like what was once underground
is now above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, that will rebirth
another underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't work for disco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, EDM, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: EDM.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: But disco was in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Studio 54.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once disco was gone, they have that
saying, once disco was gone, it was never
[SPEAKER_05]: the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think cannabis will ever be
quite the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love that you're positive about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to be very optimistic and
positive as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think boutique or craft
cannabis is going away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, it'll only get bigger and
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, they'll allow interstate
commerce, because that's the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, man, some of my friends,
they grow Amazing Flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they could just sell it in all 50
states, they would be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely crushing it.
Legitimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of places, a lot of regions
that have really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it becomes such a big commodity,
it's not going to be as valuable as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you're going to kind of have to
love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the middle, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the middle, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the extremes, there's going to be the
extremely cheap and the extremely
[SPEAKER_05]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see that with the NorCal Nemo and some
of these brands down in LA and New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sprinkles sprayed, whatever stuff.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not one to judge, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If people want to buy it and that's their
choice, it's like, I'm not going to hate
[SPEAKER_05]: on them at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may not be what I smoke, but I'm not
going to like, knock it because if that's
[SPEAKER_05]: what you enjoy and you think that's cool,
then fucking right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of people with all kinds
of motivations, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully you find the ones that align
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some that absolutely don't
align with you in the same industry doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the outsiders, you are one in the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there has to be a
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the true connoisseurs to care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting my hats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make weed green again.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for the election 2024.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we need to go back to
green weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need the green flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for the green flower to make
a huge comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's starting to.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are starting to get more into
sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent some time in Humboldt too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, these people know weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like stuff that's not just lemon
cherry, stuff that's not just purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nothing wrong with purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's mostly what I breed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most of the stuff I'm working
on right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those rooms you were in today,
80% of that is going to be purple candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have some sativas in there and I
also have some crazy CBG varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have some really off the wall,
rare cannabinoid stuff that we'll see what
[SPEAKER_05]: it comes out like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the main focus is still give the
people what they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now the people want candy and
they want color.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm OK with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about flavor too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's got to have a good flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love good flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a chef and working with something
that has the potential for good flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: why would you not want to select for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And for effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end we talk about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm OK with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I breed for effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like some things I'll breed for
effect because they're uplifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other things I'll breed because they're
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some things I'll breed because they're
right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the effect of something right
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I like to have something for all
times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm a pretty regular smoker every
day, constantly throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always describe myself as a sipper
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really sit down and just take one
to the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have a little chillum,
a little puff here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no hot dabs on the show today?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're offering though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll do whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should probably fire something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fire something up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to smell and taste a lot of great
things so far today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we got now?
[SPEAKER_01]: These big joints, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to draw the line at the eighth
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only eight today, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you always hear is it
tastes good the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're rolling a joint that big that
you have to fire it up the next day,
[SPEAKER_01]: roll a smaller joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finish that fucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm OK with firing it back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like this, if I'm in the mood,
I will sit and puff it for an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I'm not, I might puff it for 30
minutes, put it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I'll come into work and I'll
smoke or whatever at the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll smoke something that's already there
and I'll also do it just to see if it
[SPEAKER_05]: tastes good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it doesn't taste good, obviously I
won't finish it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll fire something else up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it still tastes good and it's like
to me, there's candy or some good OG or
[SPEAKER_05]: some funk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, that tastes great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me want to smoke because the
flavor is so good still.
[SPEAKER_01]: The identification game, that was
something that happened recently with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend taking care of things and
doing some trimming and they totally mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: up the labels on the jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, here's this, here's that,
here's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to open the jar and be like,
no, you got these mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important thing with flavor,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I always say, if you do come back to
it, you should be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't, maybe that's not worth
keeping around because that's all killer,
[SPEAKER_01]: no filler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of what I like to try to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much average out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have so much access to stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to smoke the very best of the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always like, what can I get that's
better than that?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have usually like 10 or 12 things
that I enjoy smoking at any one given time
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep a variety as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in my drawer, I always kind of have
at least 10 different strains that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: choose from depending upon how I'm
feeling, what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, variety is really key to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one reasons why I grow
like smaller plants because I want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a larger quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: How small veg for about 30 days,
maybe flip, you know, 18 inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 inches, flip it about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also have been going when I've
been going through things, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting for shorter, squattier things,
things that don't have as large of a
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, if you're growing in a
smaller environment, you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want things with large
stretches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown some sativas in there that just
absolutely took over the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have kind of a purpose and a
specific goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I let them maybe get a little bit
taller than some other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm also looking for ones that don't
stretch a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one is, this is a permanent
midnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got seeds of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some interesting phenos.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a 3.5.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also you can tell it's grown to
perfection because it's got some nice
[SPEAKER_05]: white ash and it's got a little oil ring
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love the oil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's got good flavor in this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: This batch came out really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes good down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and these are ones where like,
it's hard to put it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can just sit here with it and talk
and take a hit, talk and take a hit and I
[SPEAKER_05]: could take a hit for two hours or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this was, this is an hour job.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is probably a 60 minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if we do it nice and slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to judge chair lifts when I go
snowboarding by how many, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarettes you could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a two smoke lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays it'd be better if it was joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke cigarettes anymore,
but yeah, you can, you could do it
[SPEAKER_01]: probably with joints these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to smoke joints going on the chair
lifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or hotbox the gondolas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been, I've never had the
opportunity, but there, there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: special about smoking at altitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we used to, so when I used to go
snowboarding, we also used to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: plastic bong that we used to travel with
and pack it with ice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we get ice bong herbs back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is like 20 years ago,
over 20 years ago, we used to just rock it
[SPEAKER_05]: out with bong herbs right out of the,
you know, right in the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day, going down the mountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We Stevens Pass is one of the local
mountains in Washington and decades ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had friends that worked up there and I
went and stayed in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the employee cabin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went and stayed there for a week
and there's a little 420 cave up there
[SPEAKER_01]: that always just had like a bong just like
permanently installed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you knew where it was and you could
actually traverse over to this place,
[SPEAKER_01]: you hit the 420 cave and the 420 bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's a big culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there, there's a lot of people,
there's a lot of snowboarders that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been involved with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was almost kind of like their,
their side hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were reps for certain companies,
which brought them all around to different
[SPEAKER_01]: shops and different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, they also had their own little
side hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun sometimes figuring these
things out years later, cause I did work
[SPEAKER_01]: in the skateboard, snowboard industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd meet them in one aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the parking lot, I'd be like,
wait a minute, you're the guy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was actually the last,
the last time I'm gonna bring up a
[SPEAKER_01]: triggering word here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the last time I really
smelled a skunk was in the parking lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: Stevens Pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I looked for it, but they had probably
walked off like half hour earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had everything that I had with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to give them everything
for a nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just give me a nug of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could smell it, but they probably just
walked off already.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice little a hundred dollar joint
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, but these are, this is what I
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can smoke this 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like this is one of those morning
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could smoke in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could smoke afternoon, evening.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the right flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's a big one though.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guarantee you put it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just come back to it an hour later,
10 hours later, the next day still tastes
[SPEAKER_05]: just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, it's an advancement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that, you know,
at least I think that legalization has
[SPEAKER_01]: brought is there's so many more flavors,
so many more profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more, but I remember smoking weed
that was like this good back in the
[SPEAKER_05]: nineties, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The cat piss to me was like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd smoke joints of cat piss and
literally smoke them the next day and they
[SPEAKER_05]: tasted good.
[SPEAKER_05]: No cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: No cat piss roach ever went to waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would smoke them down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would take it and put it in bongs at
the end of that last little roach,
[SPEAKER_05]: break it out of the paper and smoke it in
the bong right before we would throw the
[SPEAKER_05]: cat piss roaches away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was $60 straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the skunkiest weed back in
the day though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like foul skunk ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you, did you appreciate it for what it
was at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it this hindsight of like pining
for it that you're like, I appreciate it
[SPEAKER_05]: so much at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was in disbelief that it could taste
so good and all the way down when you
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke it that you could have flavor like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really sparked my curiosity and set
me up for the person that I am today
[SPEAKER_05]: because I also realized that I talk about
this a lot on my show as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ugly weed is not necessarily,
the stuff that doesn't look good isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might have an amazing effect,
but a lot of people today think it has to
[SPEAKER_05]: look good too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had the ugliest stuff ever was the
best stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I never want to like look past any of
the ugly stuff that we have in the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we want to go through and smoke
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the commercial viability side is
cool and important, but sometimes some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the stuff we want to keep just for
ourselves too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the product, I mean, if we're
just talking flower doesn't actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the consumer's eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's getting concentrated or put
into a joint like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the consumer never sees what that
flower looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that help me phenohunt do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They never see it either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give them joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get joints like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is, is because I know what
the weed looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what the flower looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what the structure looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what it smells like too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would really like to know what it tastes
like and what the effect are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those are the two most informative
pieces of information that somebody who's
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to help you do selections can do
for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can be like, Oh, this one's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you can roll them a joint of it and
they can be like, you gave me 20 joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one was by far the best, or this one
was by far the best and it felt like this,
[SPEAKER_05]: or this one made me feel like this,
but it didn't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the effect was something special.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cause those are the kinds of
feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the kind of stuff you can't get
from a COA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just cause it smells good doesn't mean
it translates into the smoke and the
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it tastes good in the beginning,
but then halfway down you don't taste it
[SPEAKER_05]: at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you get something like this where
we're getting into it right now and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: still just amazing flavor, that's what I
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I want it to taste that good
all the way down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love for the roach tomorrow to
taste just as good as it did today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just, again, that just goes back
to the amount of flavors and profiles that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing out there now, because it,
for me, it has to be a smack you in the
[SPEAKER_01]: face.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no more subpar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't want to have to imagine what
this is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to instantly know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all have that influence of
like, Oh, you know, you know, asphalt or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but I want it just to smack me
in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, there's a few profiles that
do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you're talking about asphalt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And earlier today we had the asphalt Fino
of the GMO banana Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is the most asphalt I've smelled
in a long time where it's straight up
[SPEAKER_05]: smells like hot asphalt.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just been poured.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause when you're going through different
selections, things remind you of childhood
[SPEAKER_05]: or past memories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the things that excite me the
most.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I love doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's one of the things that I
love the most about going through rooms is
[SPEAKER_05]: when you can find something where it's
like, Ooh, fresh, hot asphalt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in your mind, it's like,
when you start thinking, when did I smell
[SPEAKER_05]: that last?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, but it's like, I've smelled
that a bunch over, over time throughout my
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's so many little things like
that green tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a green tea plant the other day
that smelled straight like green tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it when they're unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love, especially the different ones,
fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a weird turp, but it does
exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was smelling one earlier and it
smelled just like the rubber dolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you were a kid, not like the,
like the key man characters, but there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: distinct smell in Barbies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbies smell different, but yeah,
it was, it's, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit of nostalgia with it and music too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally, you know, that's,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings you back, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get a connection to the plant,
it sparks something in the brain and it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and the thing like with pheno
hunting, if you do it right, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: spending a lot of time with those plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like as they're progressing and as
they're going in from a vegetative plant
[SPEAKER_05]: into flower, you start seeing the
subtleness and the changes and it comes on
[SPEAKER_05]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes in other things,
it's very soft and subtle things that you
[SPEAKER_05]: notice are like very subtle after it goes
into flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, okay, well,
we have this structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this or that, or these smells and
where you can have some that are,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you take 20 things from the same
progeny and they all smell completely
[SPEAKER_05]: different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes you find those ones
where they're all pretty much the same,
[SPEAKER_05]: or they're all, they're all shades of
almost the identical same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whether it's orange and one's a
little more rindy or it smells,
[SPEAKER_05]: one's a little more orange juice smelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one really smells like the fruit and
one smells like the fake concentrate,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, cause you can get that or you
can get some that are like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: this one smells like burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one smells like a completely
different type of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sometimes the terminology too,
I think gets in the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always says nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's his answer to most everything,
but there are, there's like different
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of like grape, you know,
is it candy grape?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a wine grape?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it what kind of grape is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it like wine grape sparkling?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it, you know, there's grape juice.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's concrete grapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a grapefruit rollup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there there's all kinds of exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's grape candy, like a grape
Skittles, you know, cause I think of grape
[SPEAKER_05]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think of Skittles as all the just
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's the candy, like when
someone says that, I think of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar, but if you talk about grape
Skittles as opposed to green Skittles,
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, to me, those are distinct.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then with grape, it's like there,
there's a bunch, there's a ton of bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially when you compare it to
wine, I said a ton of bunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making up words, but you know,
it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with things like grapes and with
oranges that are complex and there's so
[SPEAKER_05]: many components of them, you know,
cause there's even the zest, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like going to the zest of an orange or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, it's a good joint by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty strong too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ton of bunch strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ton of bunch strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get you there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, so this is one that checks the
boxes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks beautiful, smells amazing,
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_05]: The effect is just over the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's good and it comes on
pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it just kind of goes nice and
even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the, with the, you know,
like flavors, there's, so John Gross Face
[SPEAKER_01]: Killa, shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He backs up my Westport Grape Juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually, this last dabadoo that
they had, he took second place with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hachimaki Grape Juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a combination of his 818 headband
and the Westport Grape Juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interesting enough, like he was able,
obviously he had to get analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, you know, like data and stuff
for these now, but they're terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles, exactly what they had,
the percentages, they matched so closely,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yet when you try them as individuals,
there is such a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, he's, he's starting to talk
about the nuances of blending.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're super, oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like blending, Ross.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we talk about nuances, there's
also, you know, we talk about the white
[SPEAKER_05]: papers from abstracts tech that were
released this year on flavorants and
[SPEAKER_05]: thials and sulfur and these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're measured in such minute
amounts that maybe on a COA, it looks like
[SPEAKER_05]: they're similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not on the table, DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fucking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, with these things, they're such
small amounts that they might even look
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's very similar, but like they can
be completely different, but in different
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the COAs that we're looking
at, there's no thials on there or
[SPEAKER_05]: flavorants or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not testing for any of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not getting the whole picture and
then compared with the cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_05]: give you the effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's like, but, but over time we're
going to collect a lot more data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I'm excited about is all
this data collection.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, especially when you can compare
it to effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of people, their labs or
whatever, they can compare all this data
[SPEAKER_05]: to more data, but then can you really
compare it to an effect?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause once we can start telling you,
okay, it feels, makes me feel like this or
[SPEAKER_05]: makes me feel like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can have some observable data
information that I think is very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key to a billion dollar
industry though, is when you can get that
[SPEAKER_01]: single serving effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they figured out with beer,
how it can affect the majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that with cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we haven't figured out the single
serving dosage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause beer pretty much does the same thing
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes you not very good at driving,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis makes me a better driver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't drive high usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never, never, but, but especially when
we're talking about like being impaired,
[SPEAKER_05]: too impaired to drive, if you're a regular
cannabis user, you're not impaired.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in that sense, but some people might
say you are, it's really hard to measure
[SPEAKER_05]: for one thing, but I feel like some people
usually, if you're, if you're everyday
[SPEAKER_05]: smokers that smokes all day, you're fine
driving and you're probably more cautious
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're more aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is, this is what the reason
is, is because alcohol tunes you out and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis tunes you in, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's making you more aware of your
surroundings, your environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like the more that you smoke,
the more tuned in you are and aware of
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the more you drink, the less tuned
in you are, you're tuned out and it gets
[SPEAKER_05]: worse and worse and worse to where your
perception of reality and your awareness
[SPEAKER_05]: is way down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that to me is why it's,
you know, it really bothers me that they
[SPEAKER_05]: want to arrest people for smoking weed,
for driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like if you're driving bad,
maybe you should just get a ticket anyway
[SPEAKER_05]: for bad driving, no matter what,
whether you're high or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're, you're endangering other
people, yeah, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't see a bunch of potheads
driving out there that are endangering
[SPEAKER_05]: other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do pay more attention when
they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a line, like there have been a
few times where I'm like, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive at this moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll wait until I get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, it has just made me more
aware of what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no, again, you can't quantify
that sort of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a grandma smoking that, you know,
not a regular smoker would be hurting
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who is a regular smoker is going
to be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the same amount of THC is in the
blood, how do you define that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a friend recently in another country
get pulled over and they do blood draws
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something they can't really do
here, at least in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was smart about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, please give me your sobriety test
because he gave him the field sobriety
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed with flying colors, but he knew
that his blood was going to indicate he
[SPEAKER_01]: was intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what country this was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Vietnam?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, but I don't really want to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are countries like that
where I've heard of people getting
[SPEAKER_05]: arrested for having marijuana cannabis in
their blood, which I think is absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it makes the world a better place,
not a worse place.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, that needs to be the first
point of discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second of all, it's a hell of a lot better
than alcohol and tobacco for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those two things, those are legal and
those are very widely accepted by people,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: But cannabis, the majority of people think
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are still some people that are
like, oh man, that's just the worst thing
[SPEAKER_05]: ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those people will be gone someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're getting closer every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really go back to Charlotte Figi and the
Sanjay Gupta special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think that special changed the
minds of a lot of people, or at least it
[SPEAKER_01]: made it harder to deny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once somebody sees, there's all kinds of
ways to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of medicinal ways that
people can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can kind of watch that and
still think that it's a bad thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think you're an a-hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're just a bad person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really go back to that point because
that's when we got a lot more medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to cut you off there.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, it's interesting to say
someone shouldn't be able to heal
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves or heal their children.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something wrong with that person
that says that it's not okay for plant
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine to do that if they're not hurting
other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you say that's bad?
[SPEAKER_05]: But so many people saw that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you haven't seen it, you probably
should go look up 60 minutes in Sanjay
[SPEAKER_05]: Gupta and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You type that in Google, you're gonna see
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just a life-changing thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changed my parents' mind about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, more than anything, I think that one
interview changed my mom's look at the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, her views on it weren't
great before, but definitely after that,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like hard to...
[SPEAKER_05]: Deny that it's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's how it's used too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've discovered the endocannabinoid
system through this in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the endocannabinoid system is probably
one of the major targets for most
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies right now for a
range of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we didn't know about THC and we didn't
try to figure out where it was working,
[SPEAKER_01]: we wouldn't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be pharmaceuticals that come
from the discoveries that we've made
[SPEAKER_01]: because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There already are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Marinol and that, but if that's
what people want to take, then fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But give me the right to have the origin,
plant medicine, just plant itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: GW Pharmaceuticals, they're definitely on
the cusp and have been working with
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceuticals and making... What's the
CBD, THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Epidiolex is the one that came out
for the Duvet syndrome, which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: Charlotte Figi had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're behind Sativex as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was just, I think it was a
sublingual.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jazz Pharma in the UK has since bought
GW Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, again, they're coming out with
all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Ethan Russo, who was, I don't think
he's with them anymore, but in the GW
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceuticals, he's the one who ran the
clinical trials and the double,
[SPEAKER_01]: triple blinds for the Epidiolex lives up
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been lucky enough to be...
[SPEAKER_01]: At a place where he was speaking and kind
of got to listen to him, but it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: Taming THC, the paper about terpenes in
2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what really grabbed my attention to
all these nuances of the profile and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they impact what we're going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To bring that full circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's go even more full circle and I
want to hear about your past.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about your cannabis origin
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just kind of always, you know,
the rebellious kid, tell me not to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skateboarder, just hanging out with the
older kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as just kind of cultivating myself,
that was, I always point back to when it
[SPEAKER_01]: went medical in Washington state,
when it was easier for more people to get
[SPEAKER_01]: cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a little bit before that,
but it was not very good or successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is really when I kind of dove
into it and again, getting the effects
[SPEAKER_01]: that I get from it, just, I could do it
and I just never stopped and I won't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's kind of how it got
started there.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Favorite cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the Chem 91 I got here?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Chem 91 cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Flow Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, there was a lot of very nice
smelling things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: One game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The article I just wrote, actually there's
a big chunk of it that's in soft secrets.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about Chem 91 and the importance of
Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think people need to hear that
story over and over so we don't forget it
[SPEAKER_05]: because a lot of times people forget
history for whatever reason, a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: history has been forgotten.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and we're on the shoulders of
giants.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us, all of us that are here today,
every single one of us is standing on the
[SPEAKER_05]: shoulders of other people's work in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in this industry working for
cannabis as a steward of the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're working on the shoulders of the
giants that came before us.
[SPEAKER_05]: People, a lot of unknown heroes from the
sixties and seventies, people that were
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the Lord's work because they loved
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we'll never know their names.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some of these people that did
the real stuff, but yet we are able to
[SPEAKER_05]: work with their plant and things that they
created that helped push the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you put it into
perspective, like that, it absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important like podcasts to record
this because so much bad information gets
[SPEAKER_01]: repeated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do writing for a few different
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll do my research and they always
will send me links of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like basically what the competitions
article looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at that, do something fricking
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I see the same spelling
errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of copy paste out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately that is the information
that is most front and center to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are looking for that type of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to really nail down
these details and talk to these people and
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve those stories because I always
say AI is going to suck at cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because there is so much bad cannabis
information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's going to scrape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to, that's how it thinks
it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis, I don't think it's going to
get AI or AI is not going to get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning, it won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you train, when you train Skynet,
with your system and then we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just don't turn to the dark
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't think it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we just need to know the true
stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're all, you know,
in the, in the, we all have the
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to do amazing things with this
plant, whether it's being a producer for
[SPEAKER_05]: the James Loud podcast or whether it's
being Mendo Dope that sings about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: or podcast hosts or people that are
cultivating or extract artists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the writers like Angela Baca,
Jimmy Devine, Greg Zeeman.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's another great author.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these guys are just amazing authors,
but they're doing their contribution that
[SPEAKER_05]: all is working synergistically with what
we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're part of this bigger community,
but even like, it's even bigger than just
[SPEAKER_05]: the community, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're the cannabis community,
but we're part of this something that's so
[SPEAKER_05]: much bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, you know, and it's like,
I love talking about that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: because it makes me feel good to be part
of something so much bigger and kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: know my place in the world or whatever,
or at least feel like I know my place in
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is when, you know, it's,
it's fun to see other people succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we work together,
we do, we succeed a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there's something about the
collective, just like the collective
[SPEAKER_05]: consciousness kind of working together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, like being, going back to
being a DJ, like I was, I was listening to
[SPEAKER_01]: a song up here, you know, driving and
there, there's like some songs every time
[SPEAKER_01]: that just like give you the feels,
like, you know, that like the arm,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the hair on your arm stand up,
but there, it goes back to that moment as
[SPEAKER_01]: like the DJ who's just like about to drop
a record for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crowd kind of like hears it coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of hear the tease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like hold it off for a second and then
just drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like everybody in that room,
regardless of where you came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what you're into for like that split
second has that just fucking yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like have it moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is so priceless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from kind of the culture
and that's kind of what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't pay attention to a lot of the
negativity out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of life, but they are
good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, working together to the,
to sum it up quickly, but working together
[SPEAKER_01]: is a great thing, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the synergy of collaborations
and you know, synergy is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, like having you in the chat and then
having you on the podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeing you back in the day,
like supporting the James loud show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, you were a big supporter of
podcasts and you are the reason that I did
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like you that were watching,
that were tuning in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like some crazy 4,000 people live
on some of those episodes from all around
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to give credit to Peter for
doing such a good job with the future
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be a rad interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a rad interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, but yeah, I mean, we have a,
we have an amazing opportunity right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of us, because the thing is,
is times are going to get better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Times are also going to get worse and then
they're going to be better again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're good, we need to remember
that they want to always be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're bad, we need to remember
that they can be better and they will be
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, but it takes this whole
community, this collective consciousness
[SPEAKER_05]: to really put forth the effort to make it
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's so many good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's some bad actors,
of course, with whatever you do,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's always going to be bad actors.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a whole, there's still a lot of
good in the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people that believe in this plant
for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, and that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps me motivated and happy to work
every day, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I have a great place where
I can come work and enjoy my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've set this place up to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I come and I like being here all day
and I don't feel like I need to leave to
[SPEAKER_05]: go somewhere else that's more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's, it's the same reason
too, why, like, you know, I followed you
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's you going back to the vibe
thing, you know, you try to, you try to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch that same wavelength, but there's a
lot of people that were there with me on
[SPEAKER_01]: those shows that are still in your chat
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a community, you know,
that you've built and that we've all
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to with over time as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got a lot of new ones too,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some really great people in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, and then Rue,
he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: He came, we went out to Reagan on the
river.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, these are legendary
stories that, you know, we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: tell our grandkids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but yeah, just part of this
community that's so much bigger than
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, what do you have on the horizon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, on the horizon, just, um, the Chad
Westport.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's, that's my website,
but the Chad Westport YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where they'll find most stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I do, you know, a lot of live
shows I try to talk to a lot of home
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners because I want to answer some of
their questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say, I just want to get people
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just want to get you growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can talk about other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what a lot of the live shows
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing the dope history,
which is kind of like we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to some of these people who might
not be known by today's people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but absolutely should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, Keith Stroop, Tom Alexander,
Wolf Siegel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've had Jorge Cervantes,
Ed Rosenthal, people that people that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they know those people,
but there's other people that they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but the preserving the stories are
so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I always liked doing the
seed collector show too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing more and more James Loud
packs pop up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was the best interview that you've
done since you started doing your show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's hard to really pick a favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's so many that I learned
from, you know, earlier I said it's nice
[SPEAKER_01]: being in the front row, able to raise your
hand and have every question answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so everybody from like breeders to
different scientists, um, people smarter
[SPEAKER_01]: than me basically, uh, dang, I can't pick
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, my, I think the Reggie Gadino,
interview was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maya from Ohm was the, my favorite one
this year, but I've done so many,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one that's coming out by the time
that people watch the show, the Derek from
[SPEAKER_05]: Planta.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a great episode, but yeah,
the Derek from Planta episode was really
[SPEAKER_05]: frigging amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we had a lot of synergy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He sees the plant on the same level that I
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think he does an amazing job with
cultivation as far as he's one of the best
[SPEAKER_05]: out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Maya from Ohm, it's just,
you can't go wrong with Maya.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's another one that like, we've hung
out a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know each other from events and stuff
like that, but getting her on the podcast
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to talk to her in depth like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: She sees the world in the same way that I
see the world in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_05]: which having guests that you can like
connect with on that level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a lot of guests that I connect
with, but for hers, it was like the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation I feel like was really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, so many other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many other, it's just been so
many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, having Jeff from further
come in on the Sarah Pion, he was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a fun interview.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, the funny thing about
podcasts is I really like interviewing two
[SPEAKER_05]: people, almost more than individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like there's something about
that energy where like you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: shooting around and you're talking to both
people and it's just a little faster paced
[SPEAKER_05]: and it just can go in different directions
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause now instead of two ideas,
we have three ideas and that can take us
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they, when they buy well as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like kind of having guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to do that a lot more too,
is just have kind of two people to bounce
[SPEAKER_01]: things off of because it is stimulate the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three minds are better than two sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, uh, well, and cause when
you're asking questions, people want to
[SPEAKER_05]: ask questions and it can just go,
the conversation can go in so many
[SPEAKER_05]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like we've grown as a podcast,
like from our first episode to now it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, nobody's even seen the episode that
we filmed before the first episode that
[SPEAKER_05]: our current producer, Ryan, wasn't a part
of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not that it was bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris Castle was the guest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have that hidden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll release it one of these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good interview.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like, and I've made,
I've been made friends from people being
[SPEAKER_05]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm friends with a bunch of people
that were guests that we were just kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of, I knew them or maybe I had their phone
number, but I wasn't really getting in
touch with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I feel like I've made good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now like, I feel like I have a lot
more friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more people, like-minded people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always great to feel that because
there's so many good people in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry that are like that too,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so, we have so many good
ones and there's so many that haven't been
[SPEAKER_05]: on the show that are great that I'm
looking forward to getting a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nice guys are shy guys or girls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, so we had,
I was up a can of fest and there was like
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple of people I really wanted to
interview.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I, they're on my bucket list of
people to interview and they're a little
[SPEAKER_05]: shy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they clam up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talkative without their red light
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people, some people are like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, the camera, they don't, yeah,
they, they can't open up on the camera,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's just practice because I was a
little nervous the first time I did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm, I'm definitely not nervous
from filming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although at can of fest, I fucking was
nervous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first time I've been nervous
on camera for a while, but it was because
[SPEAKER_05]: every time I would get too close to the
mic or too far away from it, either you
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't hear it or I get close and then
we'd get feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just, it wasn't that I was
nervous as much as I was annoyed by it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like making me cautious of how
I was having to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cared about the end and the end
consumer about the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Johnny and so Johnny from
Huckleberry hill farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had Jason from a Ridgeline on a
panel that I did when I was up at can of
[SPEAKER_05]: fest 2024.
[SPEAKER_05]: What an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I see that sometime.
[SPEAKER_05]: The interview was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those guys are super passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, outside of the studio,
things are really out of your hands
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's what impresses me the
most about these stereo systems that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been to like at festivals over the last
like year and a half, two years,
[SPEAKER_05]: how much better the sound systems have
gotten.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like as the audio engineer, I don't like
bad sound, so I'm all for it either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard plenty of bad sound in my
life at events.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I used to go to raves back in the
day and a lot of concerts throughout my
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's been good sound and bad sound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes you go and you think it's
going to be amazing and it's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And other times you think it's going to be
bad or not have any expectations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the no expectations, to be honest.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: In life I found whether it's going to the
movies or going to shows like that I'm not
[SPEAKER_05]: sure about having no expectations is so
much better than somebody said it was
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be good or somebody said it was
going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of times when they say it's
bad, maybe it's OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if they say it's really, really good,
I have these high expectations and I go to
[SPEAKER_05]: this event and I'm just like, eh,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to judge it by the source to
movies.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times like that when somebody's
like, oh, you got to see this movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, if I don't know that
person, I know some of my friends,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they say that for sure, I'm like,
yeah, I need to see that movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: But sometimes if somebody's like,
oh, man, you got to see this movie and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we don't have the same taste out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I always try to go with less
expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're less disappointed that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get less disappointed in life for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You set yourself up for your mind to be
blown as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all depends on how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's happened a bunch in my life,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with weed, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you're like, someone says it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're like, oh, well,
good to you and good to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or holy shit, what was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to smoke more of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's no more available.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little sad about the sour D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wish I had some right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were here next week, you could try
it because I will have some to taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super special.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our D is something special.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, really, in all reality,
that's our D is some of the best stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: I've smoked in a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it made me realize how much I love
sour diesel still, even though I talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about it a lot until you get to experience
it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: The conversation is much different than
the reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you see it, you're like,
oh, I was right all along.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I think our minds can be
fickle or our minds can deceive us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think we remember things a certain way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it wasn't that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I hear some of the stories from my
friends and I've seen them change over
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that's not that way with me,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I always think, fuck, I hope my stories
don't change as much as some of my
[SPEAKER_05]: friends' stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if I think a lot of it's
accidental.
[SPEAKER_05]: But your mind maybe remembers stuff
differently as we get older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of this, we weren't really
thinking or the people weren't thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: they needed to remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't important at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were drinking way too much at the time,
or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or high on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a very good joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I said that three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at least three stars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a five star.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't have to put rosin in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the size of a hash hole without the
hash hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably destroy me if I went
for one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, back in the day, that was all I
could afford for two weeks at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make that eighth get by just a
little bit here, a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you just take a couple hits a night?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or how would you do it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd take a pack of bowls of it and then
smoke a pipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, protopipe, flashback to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little chamber pipes that you would
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd try to keep your resonated piece in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my protopipe over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about protopipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still make them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The real ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also make the knockoffs, which suck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't smoke a knockoff pipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you tell?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, don't order them off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may order it from protopipe.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally, if you order it from
protopipe.com, you're not going to get a
[SPEAKER_05]: knockoff.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you order it anywhere else,
you're taking risks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in head shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that I would trust it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would order it directly from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Protopipe.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Classics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love supporting the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're OG, small business.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the type of people we need as a
community to support.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm trying to get them on the show
because you know they have the best
[SPEAKER_05]: stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: A company like that, it's like they've
been around since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were up north in NorCal, which I
think they still are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those pipes are made from brass and
they're legit with that little poker
[SPEAKER_05]: that's on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you need the poker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The little rubber tip on the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have screens in them,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't use screens in my pipe
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's glass or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did you go to the hardware store and
take the screens out of the sinks?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I took my parents screens and they
still don't know that I took the screens
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the sinks of the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I took the screens out of all the
bathrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is your friend so funny?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, that's where we used to
get screens when we were younger.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the things we put into our lungs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think, and we're okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turned out okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing a podcast, so we're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reasonably intelligent today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that, but for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have my moments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as I'm cold plunging,
typically, you know, I've been taking a
[SPEAKER_05]: break from cold plunging, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking, I moved to a new place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now we're at the new place and I'm
waiting to figure out what I want to do
[SPEAKER_05]: for cold plunges.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I took about the last two months off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a big step for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So especially since the very first show
that we did, I've been doing cold plunges
[SPEAKER_05]: and then all the way straight till about
two months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like almost every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you excited or afraid to do the next
one?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't get afraid of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like cold water doesn't scare me at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither does heat, none of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do like cold water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I could go in a cold plunge
today and I would feel great right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just thinking about it makes me
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come surfing up with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come surfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real cold water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a wetsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just, you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll die without a wetsuit up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go out for like a good 10,
15 minutes and then freeze in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause how cold is the water out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking at fifties?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, probably at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know specifically, but yeah,
if you don't wear booties up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've gotten frostbite on the top of
my feet before, because I didn't wear
[SPEAKER_01]: booties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the most painful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For three weeks, every step felt like a
sledgehammer on the top of my feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wear booties if you're surfing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're wearing pretty thick mill
wetsuits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full on with the ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get done, you just have this
like tan ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a sunny day, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got sharks up there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got sharks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear I was stocked by one once,
but I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, surfing, surfing can be
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to respect the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to respect nature, but- You got to
respect everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem with the younger
generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lack of respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn lack of respect for the ocean and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Respect is huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing that the older you get,
the, the, I don't know, the more you
[SPEAKER_01]: realize your impact and how treating
things a certain way is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only for yourself, but for other
people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to be selfish about it,
just do it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same end result.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people don't respect how strong
cannabis is and then they eat a 500
[SPEAKER_05]: milligram edible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that'll ruin your day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll teach you some respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if people are looking to find out more
