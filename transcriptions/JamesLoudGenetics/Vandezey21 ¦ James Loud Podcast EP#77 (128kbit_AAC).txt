[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast, and today our special guest
[SPEAKER_02]: is VanDeezy.
[SPEAKER_02]: VanDeezy21 from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an overnight sensation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started following him at 600,000
followers, and you're at something like
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.7 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.7, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going really well, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to Mikey about it,
and he's like, yeah, that's my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, holy shit, this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do something that's so different and
so wild, and I feel like I have 105,000
[SPEAKER_02]: followers on Instagram because I did
something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was shaking male plants, and the pollen
was flying, and that got me elevated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I see this guy lane splitting,
and he's singing along to all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my experience with riding bikes is
I've laid a couple bikes down,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would never, in my right mind,
go through traffic like that at those
[SPEAKER_02]: speeds and then be able to record it and
dial it all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, there must be something
going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green screen, what is he doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it almost doesn't make sense to your
eyes when you're watching it if you really
[SPEAKER_02]: start understanding and looking at how
fast you're going through these videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what kind of speeds are you
doing through?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely not slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not looking at this camera either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely not slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Mikey tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He showed me everything I know,
so you know how that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, man, it's crazy to me that
everybody thinks it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never thought, I swear to God,
today was the first day I was at work and
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching one of my videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this is pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, it's just something I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been riding motorcycles since I was
two years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything I do is just to the fullest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a wakeboarder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to do it to the fullest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snowboard, do it to the fullest.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go down the mountain, I just want
to go fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like Ricky Bobby, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not first, you're last.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's crazy to me, but it's crazy that
everybody thinks it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and creatively unique, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just crazy, but it's
creatively unique to where I've never seen
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody else do it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how it all happened is I've been riding
like that ever since I got my bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since I got my first Harley,
I've been riding fast, splitting lanes and
[SPEAKER_04]: dancing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dance in the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dance everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of a person that I'm always
trying to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love music.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day I was on the way home from
work and I passed one of my friends from
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, bro, you need to record
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you fly past me doing like 80,
splitting lanes and you're dancing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, so what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, dude, seriously, I've never
seen anybody split lanes with one hand,
[SPEAKER_04]: let alone no hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, dude, you got to record it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's the one who talked me into just
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did it for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this is kind of lame,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really in it for the clout or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just authentic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes across that way too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could personally, I hate to say this,
I could care less.
[SPEAKER_04]: If people like it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do something different
because you hate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't watch it then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the authentic side that just
comes across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I don't think you could do
it any other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for one thing, it's freaking
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's crazy though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never felt any type of danger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel unsafe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never personally thought it was
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm telling you today was the
first time I've actually watched a video
[SPEAKER_04]: and be like, all right, that's a little
wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, when I'm riding, I just don't
think about anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're so tuned in, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just listening to music and people are
like, you need to pay attention and watch
[SPEAKER_04]: the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm watching the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think I'm going like this back
and forth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm just listening to music and
I'm just so focused that I don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: those thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're tuned in like that,
there is no fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're tuned in and you know
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your awareness is heightened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's impressive seeing other people
do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, I've been thrill chasing
my whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of just another thing for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you ever go like really
fast in a car and you just get tunnel
[SPEAKER_04]: vision?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I feel like it's like a version of
tunnel vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can see everything still,
but I just don't care that it's there
[SPEAKER_04]: unless it's going to affect me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I just ride to where I can
predict your guys' next move.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really my whole goal is just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember early 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fastest I ever went in the earliest
2000 was like 180 in a Supra.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were down in San Jose at night and
it was dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were going on the freeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you do get tunnel vision from
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fastest I've gone splitting lanes,
nobody believes me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to 110 splitting lanes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like everybody on a sport bike,
it's not fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do 150 splitting lanes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeah, you'll do it when the
cars are going on the freeway and you'll
[SPEAKER_04]: go in and out of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're basically stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you never know when somebody's just
got to get over at that last second.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they do, it's lights out.
That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of what I look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of what you sign up for when you
get on a motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get on a motorcycle and you're
riding this little machine with a big
[SPEAKER_04]: motor between your legs, people can't see
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're one not looking for you at all
because they're barely paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either they're on their phone adjusting
the radio.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not paying.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have had a bad day and they
don't even care.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not even paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many people that don't pay
attention.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you get onto wheels, you got to know
what you're signing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like joining the military,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you join the military, you literally
sign a piece of paper that says,
[SPEAKER_04]: I might not make it back home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, it's something it
comes with.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I look at it though, I could have
a heart attack right now and die or get
[SPEAKER_04]: hit by a bus or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: People die from cancer every day and that
sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just however you're supposed to go
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Car accidents and cancer happen every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not on your bike, it could be
in a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be in an airplane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do underground construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: For work, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get into it, we dig those big
holes out and if you're down there like
[SPEAKER_04]: eight feet, the walls would fall in and
kill you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like, you could die.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could die at work every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say things like that because
people are like, oh, he doesn't care about
[SPEAKER_04]: his life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's not that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love to enjoy my life while I still
have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is short.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's short, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to live it how I want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could care less that you... It makes me
laugh because people are like so scared
[SPEAKER_04]: for me and they don't even know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you've never met me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why you're telling me you
need to slow down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your Instagram following and how
it skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was days where I was
watching it grow 50,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started out when all this started
popping off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had about 800 followers and I swear I
posted that video, that little left right
[SPEAKER_04]: video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show it to you in a little bit,
but I posted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that Thursday night?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then by Friday morning, I had like
36,000 views and I was like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I didn't get too hyped up on it
because I have another video of me jumping
[SPEAKER_04]: off somebody's roof into a pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did like a backflip off the roof and
that hit like 35,000 and then just
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing, not a single thing after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time I got off of work,
I think that video had like 2.3 million
[SPEAKER_04]: views and I already had another,
like almost a hundred thousand followers
[SPEAKER_04]: by the time I got off of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're doing double takes and
then you're checking every couple of hours
[SPEAKER_02]: or every couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it was fun, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause every, I had to, my phone,
when I set it on the table, it's not like
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody's calling me consistently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what is going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't even have my alerts set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to turn all the alerts off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, uh, even my fiance,
she'd be like, do you see what I sent you
[SPEAKER_04]: on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend not to check it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause same thing with messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, there's so many people and you
have a much bigger falling than I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like, I have so many messages.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't respond to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like, uh, it was just like,
cause they separate it now into like two
[SPEAKER_04]: different folders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you have that too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, if I go through the request
folder, it's just nonstop and it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: every like 30 seconds, 45 seconds,
it's just refresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's someone saying, Hey, and then
there's someone reaching out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they know you and you get a little
mix of all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, it doesn't suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I hate to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I sound like a, like kind of an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like a, it's a second job that
like one, I didn't want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two now it's like, if I don't sit
there and cause I don't have anybody for
[SPEAKER_04]: this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I personally got to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go to work all day, come home and
I'll have to sit there and just scroll on
[SPEAKER_04]: my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what I've learned is if I don't
check a lot of those messages,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least you miss like brand deals and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a lot of people like,
like just famous people in general that
[SPEAKER_04]: reached out to me, like trying to do
things that I seen and it was four months
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh, well, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, at what point did you
know that it was going to be a big deal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it like after that weekend,
you were like, Oh yeah, it's going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to a million followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or were you just kind of skeptical at
first?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very skeptical at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, not that I had a lot of people
telling me, it was just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't get your hopes up type thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it was like people's attention
spans are so slow that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 seconds of fame seconds of fame.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I don't think I actually
like got excited until, uh, the million,
[SPEAKER_04]: the million follower thing was cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got excited for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a little party for that,
but when I really got the most excited was
[SPEAKER_04]: probably about a month ago is when I
really actually felt like I made it
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere is when Jerry Rice added me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, you know what,
dad?
[SPEAKER_04]: I might've made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like Jerry Rice, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a Raider fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still love Jerry Rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, God, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I told my dad and he was,
that's like the happiest I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I was like, I'm doing
something, you know, so it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people don't
understand what kind of doors it opens up
[SPEAKER_02]: when you start getting over a hundred
thousand followers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you get to a million,
you're in a whole nother category,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're at 1.7 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, so the potential for
sponsorship and endorsements and people
[SPEAKER_02]: that want to put their brand and associate
it with you because of the potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's that's a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the advertising game on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've realized that it's, it's good and bad
because there's a lot of people that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of just want to use you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, there's a lot of people that
actually do care about you and want to see
[SPEAKER_04]: you do good things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to kind of separate those
people in a way, but I've kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've found out a good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've, I've kind of locked in with a
couple of people that I really started
[SPEAKER_04]: like getting good with and it's been
working for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's like
understanding these things and how the
[SPEAKER_02]: algorithm works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's, it's not straightforward
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause like I've seen some of the
most amazing videos of yours that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get the views, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the other ones that just
go crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's the timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the music.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's whatever song is kind of like doing
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then at the same time, I've like
posted songs from like the nineties that
[SPEAKER_04]: were bangers back then that nobody listens
to anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like that one will do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like I posted on what's today,
Friday, I posted Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this song that's like,
I forgot the name of the song,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's like super popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got 8 million views right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted the song on that Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like, kind of like a newer song,
but it's not getting that much attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got like 300,000 views.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, how'd you go from 300,000?
[SPEAKER_04]: To 8 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, the algorithm on Instagram is
hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many pieces and components
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you tag the artists too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've, yeah, I tagged the artists
mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'll collaborate with them,
but I do like a lot of paid promotion
[SPEAKER_04]: videos too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on those ones, I'd have to tag the
artists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, kind of have to, but I try to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't like to be that guy also.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like, Oh, look at my,
look at, look at the song I made it like,
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the video I made of your song type
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's kind of what everybody just,
just trying to get famous and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to make money off of like,
I got a really good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could care less about being famous,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, so it's like, I don't need the
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care about being famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just doing what I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get your own thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You like it or don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, if it's an artist I
really like, I'd like to tag them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they repost it, that's where I'm
like, Oh, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's kind of like, I'm not out here
reaching for their attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like all kinds of music.
[SPEAKER_04]: Country, rap, rock and roll, jazz,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's music, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, listen, I'll listen to anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody like, I just can't stand people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Country music.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you listen to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, see, you obviously haven't
listened to enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's like, there's, there's some
country I don't like, but I like country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you ask me if I like country
music, I like country music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like folk music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I like pretty much every style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's certain artists that I'm like,
Oh, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the pop, I'm not a huge fan of
some of the pop, but a lot of pop I do
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something out there for everybody
in every genre.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just, especially in 2024 where
everyone basically makes music these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, there will be something
for you out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just judge it because you don't
like that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well now I hate that whole genre.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, dude, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'll post a, like I posted like a
Mariah Carey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like R&B song.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's like, you're singing a girl
song.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dog, if you don't like Mariah
Carey, like, I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, come on man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's a good song.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want me to tell you?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're mad at me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I like, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can hate all they want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bigger you get, there's more
haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just goes exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you, you're doing something
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got haters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like everyone close to me,
they're like, they'll go on my Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: and they'll like see people like say them
the most just out landish things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they just don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, they don't know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to say it to say it
makes them feel better or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my family gets so mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go on there and say this,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like they're hating for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're hating, they're watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: They took the time out of their day to
watch a video and then go comment on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously I must be doing something
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're, if you're really taking
that time out of your day, I have to be
[SPEAKER_04]: winning at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, come on man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just sit there and I just laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like, I'm super petty too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I've learned, I need to not argue
with people on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've gotten banned twice already.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes me laugh because I know it
like one, it makes their day that somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: with this many followers is reaching back
out to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, they really think they're getting
under my skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that's, you've never met me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can get under my skin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stuff they would never ever say to my
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some dude who lives with mom in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, keyboard warrior thing,
you know, it makes me laugh, but it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: fun time though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram is wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, you know, growing,
being a kid growing up just, just with
[SPEAKER_04]: social media, being like an Instagram
thing, it's gotta be like a, not a rough
[SPEAKER_04]: life, but definitely a very different one
than how I grew up without social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a different world for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How old are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I caught the cusp of getting to play
outside with all my friends to watching
[SPEAKER_04]: the first like phone you could text on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's just iPhones and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody goes out the house anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I caught that perfect little 90s window
to 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's right with the like
invention of the internet when it started
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the whole dial up all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of, for me it was fun,
but now it's just like thinking back to
[SPEAKER_04]: not getting to witness, like just to even
care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you were that young and not even
like these young kids now, they care about
[SPEAKER_04]: social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they all want to be an influencer,
but when I was young, I just wanted to go
[SPEAKER_04]: outside and play baseball.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it's like, you don't get
that no more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just like, it's a weird,
these kids have it different these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you got the Jake Paul's,
these Jake Paul guys that are out there
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, believe it or not,
I mean, I respect what he's done to a
[SPEAKER_02]: degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's monetized it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter how much you hate on him or
think he's an idiot or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dude monetized it and made millions
and millions and millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: boxing and setting up, whether you think
it's fixed or it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even care, but the fact
is, is like he's freaking, he maneuvered
[SPEAKER_02]: in a way that he was able to monetize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can respect that side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He created his entire own lane,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's what you got to do these days if
you want to make it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think like thinking outside the
box and paving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like going through and doing something a
little bit differently, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, shaking a male plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the cannabis space to lane
splitting to, you know, rigging fights in
[SPEAKER_02]: boxing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the Jake Paul thing,
people want to see him get beat up so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hate him and then they watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And him and Tyson, it's, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, it's like him fighting
Tyson.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, cause Tyson, that's,
that's my hero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the guy who I grew up with,
you know, and it's like Tyson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's such a beast and he's such a nice
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met him a handful of times and just
really genuine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I think of the greatest fighters
of all time, especially in my lifetime,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Mike Tyson, he was the scariest.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, I was like,
man, I like Jake Paul looks like a good
[SPEAKER_04]: fighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even if the fights are rigged,
I still wouldn't want to get hit in the
[SPEAKER_04]: face by Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_04]: That right hook there, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the real world, it's like those
punches from Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: His head movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a different beast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were showing him hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen something on Instagram that he
was hitting the bags the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that looks like it might hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, well, Mike Tyson, he'll eat
mushrooms too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a handful of mushrooms online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the funny, funny what you see on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just a beast, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like him a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seen that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seen that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's one of those guys who's able to
make fun of himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the ears, you know, for his gut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people can do that though,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, they don't take life so damn
serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we all just need to take a step
back and relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell people that every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just gotta chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about weed for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got in trouble for smoking a lot of weed
by my mom, but then I had to quit and then
[SPEAKER_04]: I started again, but can't now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I have a class A, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's got to change in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They allow you to drink with a class A,
but like you can't test positive for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes absolutely no sense in my
book, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I can get off of work right now and
go pound six tall boys and then go to work
[SPEAKER_04]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like nothing happened, but smoking weed to
go to bed because I struggle at sleeping
[SPEAKER_04]: at nighttime is oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a no-no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta take away your license.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I gotta take away my license,
get fired, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, it's just, there's gotta be
some ground to where they gotta fix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: The NBA, MLB, football, like you got three
of the biggest sports in our country is
[SPEAKER_04]: legal in, but someone that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you can't bring it across state
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're in this strange time where
it's not stabilized like across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: California markets kind of suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a mix of a lot of mediocre
product on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is also at fault for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I see all day long on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you gotta have this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you gotta have this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, I don't even know what
those are.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably sound, probably fake,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of, it's a oversaturated market.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the marketing has played such a huge
role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people see it on Instagram,
like I want that and it looks the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that doesn't mean it's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean it has the best effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean it has the best taste,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, and then they're,
they get hyped up on brands, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like cookies is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cookies is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everyone, especially being from the
Bay area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew cookies was huge when I saw a
little five-year-old kid walking around
[SPEAKER_02]: the mall with a cookies t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's when I knew cookies had
like really done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their clothing is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that whole, that rapper, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Burner I think it was, was like a big
forerunner in rapping about the cookies
[SPEAKER_04]: game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that helped a lot too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause well his brand revolved around,
you know, the Burner as the cookies brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's synonymous with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of the original cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's the founder of cookies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's the one who founded cookies
with a bunch of guys from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Scherbinski and we got Jigga and
we've got Flux.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know these guys from back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, yeah, it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these guys did it and, and you know,
they built this brand around it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't just a cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's how you build the best
brands, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you don't pigeonhole
yourself, we're kind of talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier about not pigeonholing yourself
into one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you can really open up and
you have this platform now and you also
[SPEAKER_02]: have the diversity, uh, with the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just, you know, the, the,
um, the bikers, it's not just the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: with the music.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the stunt bike guys that love it
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're like, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like another time, like I realized
like it touched a whole bunch of people is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I was downtown by my house one day
and this little, little kid like on a
[SPEAKER_04]: scooter was like, Oh, are you the guy on
the motorcycle?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, I love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, it's really not just
people that ride motorcycles that actually
[SPEAKER_04]: like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like everybody, it's, it's a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get people from like Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get people from like Russia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get people all over the world reaching
out to me like, Oh my God, I love what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go on a world tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on the Autobahn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, that would be such a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna need a sport bike for that
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can go even faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got to get you out there to
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I go to Barcelona once a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some sponsors to bring you out to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I got so many like, I hate to call
them fans, but people that like me,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you coming out here, like I want to
get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to get the cannabis guys to
sponsor you to come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a fun time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be a fun time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on my bucket list.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think there's so many places
in the world where you can do it
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like to me too,
I want to challenge myself to ride,
[SPEAKER_04]: not crazy, but just how I ride somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause everybody swears.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, you come here, you can't do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you come here, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to Thailand and get a rickshaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be one with the bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I could do it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of is what it is, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you're super passionate about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that goes a long ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like, when you have a kid,
you're not going to ride like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to sell your bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just, I don't know what I would
do if I could not ride a motorcycle
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just kind of, it's just
something I have to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, just, I can't give it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I got to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just, so it's like, like you said,
like the burner thing, it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not out here doing this for Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing it for fame.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not doing it to please anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's a lifestyle for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sleep and breathing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I've been doing my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to keep doing it,
whether they like it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when I first got this,
I double back on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first blew up on Instagram,
when I first got the a hundred thousand,
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody I knew started noticing me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, well, a guy in my club,
uh, his wife was like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you're like blown up on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like check out, like look, I showed her
the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why she's like, she watched it and
she's like, okay, what about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, the, the dancing
part in the split and like the length is
[SPEAKER_04]: all, yeah, I watch you do that every time
we ride together.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the big deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like, it's normal for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy, but yeah, it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, and it's wild what
Instagram likes and doesn't like,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause everybody's trying to do something,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what works and what doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just do what everybody else is
doing and expect to get different results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a million people trying to copy what
I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bet it's like, I think it's
flattering.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I'm like,
please don't kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a good look, but people die
lane splitting every year, every year,
[SPEAKER_04]: every year I've known there's about,
I know personally almost 21 people that
[SPEAKER_04]: went down on their bikes this year and
they don't ride anywhere like I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They ride super like follow all the laws,
ride nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you go down and you're
going to go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just is, it's just a matter of when,
you know, so kind of just something you
[SPEAKER_04]: got to roll with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're going to go down in life
one way or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: One way or the other, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather be on my own terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, die fighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you originally from the Bay area?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say I'm born and raised in Vallejo
because technically I am, but I was born
[SPEAKER_04]: in Vallejo and I lived in El Sabrani for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I moved to Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my mom would never, I was not the
best kid growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my mom would never let me go to school
in Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she, she made me go to school across
the bridge at Carquines and John Sweat by
[SPEAKER_04]: the C and H factory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all about John Sweat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Indians, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't call them that anymore,
I guess, but they changed their name,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the John Sweat Indians.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they, yeah, I went to school there and
then I ended up moving out to Oakley
[SPEAKER_04]: closer to the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause then I got into wakeboarding and
that kind of... Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in wakeboarding when I was a kid
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of flipped my whole life around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was really into basketball and
football and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wakeboarding has changed so much since we
were kids, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wakeboards have changed, turned into
wake surfing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are huge into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice to not get hurt doing that and
then going to work on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I wakeboarded for the first time in
three years this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cause my fiance, she's never seen me
wakeboard before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, she's like, let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still killing it on the wakeboard?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was killing it for a second,
but I got real tired and then fell real
[SPEAKER_04]: hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I was like, I can't walk
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you're trying to launch off
the wake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got friends that like are still
professional wakeboarders and I see them
[SPEAKER_04]: pop up on like my Instagram feed and
they're like doing double flips.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 1080s and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, God, I remember when you were
like this big, now you're just... It's a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole different world now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like snowboarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't double flip, you're just not,
you're not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 10 years ago it wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, 10 years ago it was a whole
different story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know cause I had a wakeboard coach back
in the day and he was the pro at his time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go watch his videos then when he
was like one of the best in the world to
[SPEAKER_04]: now, it's like, oh, this is just way,
just two different eras.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just keeps getting more
competitive and people keep getting better
[SPEAKER_02]: and better, but there's people that kind
of set the bounds for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like what you've done is going to,
it's going to evolve into something else
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be going that way,
but I just, I like that I made my mark in
[SPEAKER_04]: my world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can honestly say that I did something
that will like, that I'm pleased with.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of people get to say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that's original.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made your mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not a lot of people can say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually people just live their life and
just try to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even just struggle with life in
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I feel like I've done something to
where I could be like, you know what,
[SPEAKER_04]: like when I'm 80, if I make it to 80,
I could look back and be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if it does nothing for me,
I'm like, I did something back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I was, I could show my grandkid
check when I was younger, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is some peace and some
happiness that goes along with finding
[SPEAKER_02]: what you were meant to do on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think a lot of people are still
lost, even older people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel blessed to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I know my purpose in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I contributed to this much bigger
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I contributed a positive way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think a lot of people were like,
they don't know why they're here or they
[SPEAKER_02]: think we're just, I think we're all here
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all are here to serve a purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that purpose is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talk about non-player
characters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and there are a lot of
non-player characters out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I believe we all have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where I was at with the
whole bike thing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I hope one day it works out to
where I could just literally ride my bike
[SPEAKER_04]: every day for a living.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just, that's my angle right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can do that and I feel like,
I really feel like my personal purpose is
[SPEAKER_04]: to put smiles on people's faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm doing a good job, but I love
when people hit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had so many people hit me up and
like, you know, like I really needed this
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was having the worst day of my life
and just seeing you have a good time and
[SPEAKER_04]: smiling is making my day just better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, happiness is contagious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's watch some of your videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to show you, where is it at?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the video that made me go viral
right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The crazy thing about this when I first
started is people think that the cars are
[SPEAKER_04]: paid actors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost crashed in this video because if
you watch the video, I do just the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: little, the arm thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go left, right, do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was all I was ever going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was riding so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I seen the lane, just the gap opened up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, check this shit out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just started going with the music
and I came right and I was, I had to hold
[SPEAKER_04]: it for so long because I was going so
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about that far from clipping the
back of that truck because I just,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was just something I was doing and
people are just like, are you,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the one that made it pop off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what's going on in your head?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not even thinking about
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just thinking about the music and
the energy and you can't really think in
[SPEAKER_02]: those types of moments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really honestly, man, I can't really
tell you what I'm thinking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, I'm really just, it's almost
meditation, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just cruising and I just put on the
music and I'm just, it's literally like
[SPEAKER_04]: the only place in my life to where I can
just, there's nothing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just finally, there's just, I'm not
thinking about work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not thinking about any projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just thinking about the problem I have
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just living in the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, if you can find that place,
that's like, that's, that's another thing
[SPEAKER_04]: that's hard for people to find is just a
space that where you are just truly like
[SPEAKER_04]: happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, that's my happy place,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think about nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just full throttle and let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That feeling of just getting put back
every time you hit that gas is just,
[SPEAKER_04]: God, this is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how fast have you gone on the streets?
[SPEAKER_04]: How the fastest I've ever gone 146,
147.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really fast on the bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on my old bike, but yeah,
that was, that was really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That bike was no joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: That bike was fast, but I got another one
and we're going to see if we can make that
[SPEAKER_04]: one just as fast too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's slow right now, but it'll,
it'll get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, what I cruise at and what I got
get, I cruise at about a hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's if I'm, my a hundred is cruising
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm going anything below that,
it just feels slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have a good bike, it doesn't
feel like you're going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like, I can't believe you ride that
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, ride it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I tell them up to people all the
time, ride it, check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want you ride it and you're doing a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll feel like you're going like 65.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you ever done a hundred and
like, like a big lifted truck and you feel
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're flying and you go do a hundred
and like a Beamer and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm doing a hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's kind of like a hundred in
the rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even feel like a Mercedes or a
BMW.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you have some sort of lifted
truck and you're going 80.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes like you're flying or you drive
a car from the eighties, like Subaru and
[SPEAKER_02]: we got that over a hundred and it just
shakes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you get a nice bike and you
won't, that's why you get a sport bike
[SPEAKER_04]: with a stabilizer on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that thing is as smooth as butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're 200 miles an hour on those things
and it don't, it don't feel like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things are fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm not allowed to have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody tells me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you definitely can't have one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna kill yourself on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a bike, that's so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some people on those things that go
just, I think it's too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's saying something if I think
it's too fast, but it's, they're wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a friend who has a Ferrari and he
goes like 210.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he films it with one hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could hear us laughing a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your, uh, biggest video you've
had?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're up over 20 million views.
[SPEAKER_04]: My biggest video got deleted by Instagram
because they delete my stuff all the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: but never notify me about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know why it happens all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know if it's cause if
they're having trouble with the song,
[SPEAKER_04]: like they're, however they work it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be, they might have to pay the
artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to pay 50 cents or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a song by Jack Harlow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the song, but it had
before it got deleted at 49 million views,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the next highest I got,
I think there there, there's a lot in like
[SPEAKER_04]: the, I think the 30 millions, I think I
won that's 35 million, uh, 20 millions
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're got a bunch in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the views of that, they haven't
slowed down.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just slowed down to where it's not
all hidden at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there was a point to where every,
any, no, any video I posted, no matter
[SPEAKER_04]: what it was, it was getting 2 million
views within two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just kind of like, I could promise
you promotion views here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just post anything and it's sitting
a million views.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause, uh, it tells you on Instagram,
um, like how many people you've reached in
[SPEAKER_04]: the last month, it was consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's insane to me that hit 109
million and I only got 1.7 million
[SPEAKER_04]: followers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, mine was his peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at 5 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Instagram, I was reaching 5 million a
month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see some of these guys that have 10
or 15 or 20, I follow some jiu-jitsu guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have really big followings and it's
pretty wild, but yeah, a hundred million
[SPEAKER_02]: in a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so why it was like that
consistently for like five months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was like, it never went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everything on my Instagram was
broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, like the, like where it shows
you where people like it bro, it was
[SPEAKER_04]: broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when it shows like, um, what's it
called?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, like, uh, it's like
professional request or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't even pop up with anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my, uh, the, like when it shows,
it's funny too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like my girlfriend started or my
fiance started to break too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like her following, cause people
started following her too.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's on private though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now it's like, it's broken at like,
I think it's at like 900 is like just
[SPEAKER_04]: broken there, but I know it's way more
than it's got.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet she hit approved right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'd probably have like 30,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it was a, it was a culture shock for
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, I don't really, before that I
never really use social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I kind of had one to have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had Facebook had that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as I would all do my boy,
man, he told me to start recording and I
[SPEAKER_04]: did it in, I hated it and then it worked
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kept doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, it didn't really cost me
anything to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do it on my way home from work every
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was like, why is the
background looks the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be staged.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, they're like, where are you
going?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like home every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like green screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm like, somebody was like,
there was a comment the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I can't believe he's using a
green screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was like, I know that freeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody's going to use a green screen,
it definitely wouldn't be that place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 680.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think a lot of people probably
think you speed it up, but then it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do your lips sync up with the music?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even my own friends are like, that's gotta
be sped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be sped up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like it when you're watching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be the wide angle then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come ride with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even a buddy from work.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: After work one day we rode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear he almost died trying to keep up
with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, okay, it's not fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it's just, it's funny to me
that when you see people on Instagram that
[SPEAKER_04]: are not a part of this lifestyle,
they think it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody would ever do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when I talk to people like from
the motorcycle world, they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh yeah, I used to do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I do that all the time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go out and ride with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're crazier than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: They just don't record it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the only dummy that started recording
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just, it's a culture shock for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you give people, you know,
they have enough information to know
[SPEAKER_02]: enough about it to be dangerous,
but not to really know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they want to assume that they're an
expert on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many people are now, you know,
internet experts, internet experts is the
[SPEAKER_04]: worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me tell you, like they always,
that's so illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I go, I send them a screenshot of
the California state law that says that
[SPEAKER_04]: the cars have to get out of my way
basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's like, we're like, I think it's
either us in one other state or it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the only one you can lane split in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, do you know why lane
splitting is legal?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even really, there's a
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason is, is because the bikes
back in the day would overheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you had to sit in traffic,
your bike would overheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why lane splitting is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least my father, my father told me that
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see it because I have an 03 now and
that thing likes to try to overheat all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time because it's like, if you sit out
of light, Oh, those things get so hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in the chat is going to jump in
and explain it perfectly like why the
[SPEAKER_02]: engines overheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, back in the fifties and sixties,
I can see that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's great though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great law and I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, cause it's like, everybody's
like, Oh, someone needs to open their door
[SPEAKER_04]: on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll go to jail for manslaughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not tripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're, when you're a driver in a car
and there's a motorcycle coming in,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually you guys go to the one over from
the fast lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, I would say typically that's
where you should ride.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of people splitting lanes like
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in California they're trained,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in California, if you're splitting in
the fast lane, there'll be times when that
[SPEAKER_04]: right car will get over for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they don't see you, they'll hear
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they hear you and they get over,
it's happened to me while I was trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: get to an exit, they heard me,
but they didn't see me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they started getting over, but I was on
their right side and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's kind of like, you gotta be trying
to stay in that far left lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, good etiquette.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you like bikers, good etiquette
is if you're in the fast lane to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: give them a little bit of room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what the worst is though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for me, I don't really care if you
get over it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to cause my bike's small.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what bothers me is the people that
have their tow mirrors out that aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: towing anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are like, well, but those are the
people that don't even know their tow
[SPEAKER_04]: mirrors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the other thing is you got guys
that have no idea that those mirrors
[SPEAKER_04]: actually can go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the worst too, because like when
you're splitting a lane, they're like
[SPEAKER_04]: right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to duck under them every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they don't get over, yeah, I gotta go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Closed line by a mirror.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be right off that bike.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, everybody,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I'm driving, if I see a bike,
I try to get all the way over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people, that ride will tell you don't
do that because if the car gets all the
[SPEAKER_04]: way over, like into the, basically where
you'd pull out, it shoots up a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, dirt and just whatever's over there
and it'll start hitting you all in the
[SPEAKER_04]: face and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let somebody else tell you,
but a lot of motorcycles don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get over, cool, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't, here's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But me personally driving, I try to get
all the way over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people hate it though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing you a favor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you can't have your cake and eat it
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: They already don't want to get over.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get all the way over and then you're
mad about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of that motorcycle where you
think share the road and be aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awareness is just such a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even just driving, but in life,
just be aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's just so on the split in lanes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I watch right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just see, especially in traffic,
right after work, it's bumper to bumper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a scrolling, scrolling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people just on their phones all
the time, which I I'm guilty too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't hate too much, but I don't go
on social media when I'm driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially not on a freeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most cars now, if you have a modern car,
you know, you get the messages on your
[SPEAKER_02]: screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can answer the phone from the screen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make these cars and drives themselves
anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where they're all coming to you
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can make motorcycles that drive
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So seriously, how shitty would that be?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got the motorcycle that's
self-driving, the Tesla motorcycle
[SPEAKER_02]: self-driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a couple of years, I don't know when,
but they're apparently supposed to be
[SPEAKER_04]: putting like limiters on motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the new ones to where they're set to
like speed limits as they change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't go over them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ride too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm personally ride way too fast,
but it's like, you need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you need that extra little to
get out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's consequences, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I mean, there are consequences
for speeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, you go over the speed limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be 65 now, technically it's 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a five mile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it gives you like a five to 10
mile grace period thing on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think they can, they will ticket
you any, you know, they can take anything
[SPEAKER_02]: above 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, and there's
consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a ticket, you pay your ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you get in a car accident,
your insurance goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff, your insurance goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's consequences for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, reckless driving is another thing,
but that's, that's all subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really reckless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you drive 85 and not be reckless?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think you can drive reckless at
70 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: True.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's crazy because people always tell
me I'm reckless driving because I'll have
[SPEAKER_04]: my hands on the wheel and I'm taking them
off and doing all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no law that says you are required
to have your hands on the bars for the
[SPEAKER_04]: motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you putting people in danger?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that says that I can't
ride with one hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that says you have to have
both on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're for the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's a law or not,
but I know you take your test.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're supposed to be 10 and two,
but there's nothing that says that for a
[SPEAKER_04]: motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, everybody thinks they just,
they know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just kind of roll with it these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to look at some weed and
you're going to tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just want your, your honest
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go through some stuff,
some rec flower, and you're going to give
[SPEAKER_02]: me your opinion and you're going to,
I know what's good and what's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've tried all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get your opinion on
what, what is what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super excited about this actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first sample we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something I got at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hearing that word a lot today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Emerald Cup is an event that started up
in the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like the, you know,
the, the fall festival where we shared our
[SPEAKER_02]: harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the growers would bring their fresh
flower and there was a competition,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best of, and you would, you know,
for the last 20 years, this was the 20
[SPEAKER_02]: year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have this contest and it was
the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best of the Emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last one was in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that it was in Santa Rosa and it's
an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're a cannabis guy and
you want to see good outdoor flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it always is proof the good
outdoor exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it all outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is supposed to be, but there's been,
there's other categories and now there's
[SPEAKER_02]: home growers and there's commercial
growers and there's, there's all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things and there's different
categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have rosin back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing that was, I've just
started hearing about, cause I'm like
[SPEAKER_04]: super out of the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody told me, I was like, what the
hell are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at this.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's very, very purple and white.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, when I used to smoke weed,
this would be considered gas where I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, this is, this looks like some grade
A, like some grade A weed right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's some lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very popular right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the most popular genetics on
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's super good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, that looks like definitely some
top tier, the top tier right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maj Riefer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And next.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I think is crazy these days?
[SPEAKER_04]: The packagings, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's packaging game is off the
charts now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such about marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a, like the vape things are like
just a regular, like the nicotine vapes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like just, like everybody's got to
get the new thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get that new package out there and
everybody's like, Oh man, that new,
[SPEAKER_04]: I see them all the time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, these things are wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some Kush face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's got a way different smell to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when I think of gas, this right here,
that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG, like that real fucking pungent gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I used to smoke weed, I was the,
I was a, I'm a big sour diesel fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I know it's hella old school,
but like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my jam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite strand ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gave me the perfect high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was always, I could get everything done
in the world afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, that was the perfect,
the perfect strand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is dense too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's super frosty right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This smells super good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there like a sour smell to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have that gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from that Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely got a Kush in it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely got a cushy smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was big on the OG Kush back in the day
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, I feel like, I feel like I sound
so old when I say stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause remember I, there's these kids that
I know that smoke weed and they kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: always try to tell me the new,
they're like, you, what you know about
[SPEAKER_04]: this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, my I used to smoke sour diesel
back in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want you to take and squeeze those
nugs and really get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's one thing smelling the jar,
but squeeze that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things are sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be wiping your fingers off for days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell those fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell that bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know what you think of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that remind you of anything from your
past?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: That smells like some old, some old school
sour something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, you're a real smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You identified sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you get a lot of credit for that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I used to smoke tough, I used to
smoke like almost a zip about a day,
[SPEAKER_04]: day and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much like I used to telling you,
man, I don't like to drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I get really hung over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I believe, I personally believe
alcohol will kill you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think weed will do nothing but help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next one is some Four Z's from
Lempire Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Four Z's?
[SPEAKER_04]: Four Z's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it put you to sleep or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that related to the Sunday drivers and
stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but Sunday drivers is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this one's just all candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when people say candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Smells really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say, if I was smoking,
I'm more of a fan of like the more of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush one, but this smells really good
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really dense too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as sticky as that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more like, I used to like really,
really sticky weed, or I liked a really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really dark purple weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was kinda.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next one I got for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is some dark, dark purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that purple?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it makes me want to quit my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the darkest purple I think I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically black.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is from Rob at Native Selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that is called purple sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some grade A grade A right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special because of the color,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen frostier bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen louder bud, but that is purple
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as purple as it gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some nugs of OG Kush over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that brings back memories right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some classic OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some of the most purple weed I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The strands they got these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a whole nother world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this right here is some Moonbow IX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Archive Genetics, grown by Flora and
Flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's frosty too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's candy too, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's related to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smells a little similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one right there is some strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry cough, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the berries on the nose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big time.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is from Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is some veganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Veganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It means he, well, so veganic means that
it doesn't have animal inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's doing, it's a company called
Organics Live that he gets his new chance
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vegan and organic kind of in a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that makes sense with the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that's straight like berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That definitely is a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I gotta be like your lamest guest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I can't even smoke weed on here with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not the first that doesn't smoke
weed, but you're outside the circle of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this isn't really your.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your thing, but you know weed,
you know, Sourdisa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a lot of props.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I would say a lot of my guests,
I show them that sour and they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: eh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, that's the best one in the book
right there for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a cherry kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is some haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is super silver haze from Florian
Flame, bred by Greenhouse Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is, that's the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that lime and that, that loud
nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of burns your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you say that, it tastes like lime
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd probably be some of my favorite
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so casual question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause so how do you, are you picking your
favorites off the, the taste, the feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: or like what, what are you, what are you
going off of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause mine used to be, it was more of the
feeling than the taste because it already
[SPEAKER_04]: like me personally, there's only been
about maybe three different strands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could actually like taste the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Blue Dream was one, Sour Diesel was
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was a, it was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you smell Granddaddy Purple?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was, no, it was like a,
it was not cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a cherry gelato or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a charrier flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had one that tastes like
lemonade, but I don't remember what it
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what are you, what are you basing that
off of?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're breeding and selecting for
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also effect, you know, I talk about on
my show a lot, like going back to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're popping a bunch of plants
and we're looking for that next winter,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give people joints, I smoke joints and
it's like, I know what the weed looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like, but I want to know from you,
how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does it taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does it burn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it burning even?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we cure it correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are things that can be adjusted
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas like, yeah, nice ash on there and
stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the effect can come down to what
day it was harvested on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff we might grow at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, oh, we need to harvest it on
day 56 and not on day 60.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that stuff makes like a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: A huge difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I don't know too much about growing
it, but I know from people I know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I've learned some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some mutual friends that grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how, but I just kind of,
I didn't know like, it just, it's such a
[SPEAKER_04]: science to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I hear people who like really,
really, really know what they're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about, I'm like, bro, you sound like you
work at the Berkeley lab right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm like, you know, you are like one
of the smartest people, persons,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever that I've ever met when they talk
about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, it's literally a science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you guys got it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, day 53, if you want more candy for
like Skittles, you harvest a day 52 to day
[SPEAKER_02]: 54.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want something that's more gassy and
stronger, like stronger effect wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to day 60, 63.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might yield a little bit more,
but then you lose the candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's all kinds of little things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you learn how to grow that one
specific plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you learn right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other times there's a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff like blue dream is the easiest
thing in the world to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff was everywhere for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to grow, but also you can get
better, better and better by improving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think making small adjustments over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go over and over, you can,
you can grow better than you did the
[SPEAKER_02]: previous run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most stuff is like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like lane splitting in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time you do it compared to
as you learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy about the, which is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I first got my motorcycle,
I wouldn't say I was scared to go on the
[SPEAKER_04]: freeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've had motorcycles and been on the
freeway a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it was brand new and I was kind
of just so nervous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then kind of just over time you just,
you learn like we'll say with the one
[SPEAKER_04]: strand, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of just perfect that one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I, I rode this bike every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of just became one with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just figured it out, you know,
it kind of just, and now just,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's why it's so good, I guess,
you know, you just, you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, I guess it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you, I didn't know there was so much
into it like that though, just from day to
[SPEAKER_04]: day, it can change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have too much humidity for part of
your cycle, like a small part of it or too
[SPEAKER_02]: much heat from the summer, your water
temps get too hot or too cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that earlier today, something
about the, like the higher water temps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely had no idea about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a mutual friend that's been
having problems for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because his water temps are too
warm and that can cause problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just the, like, I guess it's the
little things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's understanding and awareness,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's all these little details and
the better you understand them,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better results you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just learned not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like cloning is a thing now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was not a thing when I was growing
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so dumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know you could do that with all
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can do like an orange tree and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lime tree cloned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the same process, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikey likes to clone all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who I learned most of my knowledge
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out Mikey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, he teaches me a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we were to put all these things in
order from the ones that you just smelled,
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't get to taste them,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you didn't get to look at them and
smell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your top three?
[SPEAKER_04]: So my favorite would be that sour you
showed me down there, but I would say the
[SPEAKER_04]: one in the tin can, that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smelled amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is something I'd want to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kush face is one I'd want to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that one would be my
favorite, but the one in the first one in
[SPEAKER_04]: the purple bag, that one would be,
I would put the purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would put the one that was dark purple
up there just cause I'd want to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my favorite, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't really know if personally it
would be, like in my top three,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would be something I'd definitely
like put up there cause I feel like I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely I think the one in the tin
would have probably been my favorite if I
[SPEAKER_04]: got to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that hits you right in the nose,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hits you right in the nose,
kind of like it hits you in the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like some that are narcotic and
tight behind the eyes and make you hungry
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where that stuff is a stimulant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got another one to show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I was a big like head high person
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the ones that give you like the body
type highs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was not, that would just make me so
lazy and tired and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this kind of has that same lime to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that terpenaline nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like turpentine a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look the most beautiful,
but that is some organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's grown in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels way more kind of like organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave from Bud-A-Laro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely like more fluffy,
like not as dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a little bit more fluffy,
but it's kind of like the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And see, like it's weird to me because
like everybody kind of like that I know
[SPEAKER_04]: personally now that smoke, it's like,
they want like super dense weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: super like, so it's got to be like frosted
over and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I see stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, that's probably fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you guys are smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sleeping on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it smells like that, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it smells like gelato and it looks like
that, we got a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: See when it's like, yeah, that's,
that would be up in probably my top three
[SPEAKER_04]: right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's the type of stuff I used to
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of, I don't know, like the
whole weed game to me is like a,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a new, it's, it's changed drastically
from when I stopped smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it seems like it was overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's, everybody's got a new
thing that's kind of came out,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's to me, it kind of seems like the
same thing as the last thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of got a little bit
different twist on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, you know, then when I
see stuff like that, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: see, that's what I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's what I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people don't even know what they
want until you show it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think they know what they want in
their head and then they get to experience
[SPEAKER_02]: it and they're like, Oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it can go either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like stimulants and some
people like, it's like some people like
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol and some people like cocaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be all over that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the, the narcotic alcohol
effect where it makes you tired,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can have the uplifting one where
you're like, I'm ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to go party.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I learned too, is like,
you got to find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to do a lot of trying to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just, and that's what I don't
get with some people just, I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: here, but probably all over is like,
they think it's so bad because they've
[SPEAKER_04]: tried it one time and it made them all
paranoid and they started freaking out or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, maybe you just need to try a
different strain or you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of truth to
that, that somebody eats a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, Oh, we had a really
bad trip, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Five edibles and they'll hit you at one
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: One edible that was equivalent to 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you eat the two and wait like 45
minutes, it doesn't hit you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you eat two more and then all of a
sudden you can't get off the couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been there lots of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're done for like eight hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, I need to go get in the
shower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to sober up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, drink milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's a certain point where
there's not much you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ride it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not call the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to die.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's people that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cop in Vallejo, speaking of
which, that stole evidence from the
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence locker and him and his wife ended
up eating the edibles and they called the
[SPEAKER_02]: cops on themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They called 911 on themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to post the news article from
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis is, it's a powerful drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be mild, but it can also be
extremely powerful in large quantities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally think it can cure cancer
because I've seen people with cancer and
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll start some like never smoked
cannabis day in their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to hate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they started doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I swear, like they started eating
again and they just seem like a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: nother person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the one, the person I know ended
up being cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, small miracles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, see, man, you just need to,
not even that it cures it, but it just
[SPEAKER_04]: makes you to relax.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have that stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have studies that shown that cannabis
can cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the end all be all solution,
but it can I mean, certain types of
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, skin cancer, Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, there's all kinds of
things that they've shown that it's worked
[SPEAKER_02]: for certain instances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just don't think it's going to make
it any worse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just don't, you know, it makes the
world a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snoop Dogg has been smoking for how long
now?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like, he's one of the most
successful, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's one of the most successful
people in this world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it obviously can't be that bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I'm like, these laws got to
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to stop putting people in prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, it's just, there's so many more
people out there doing way worse things
[SPEAKER_04]: that this is probably not the thing you
should be worried about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's watch another video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's watch the biggest video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually, I'm going to show you the
video I just posted a couple of days ago
[SPEAKER_04]: that hit 10 million views as of like right
now in two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically this one is it's a new song that
came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, what's the, I can't, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I want, I'm going to, please don't
get mad at me in these comments because I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know where he's from and I don't
know his name, but I'm pretty sure he's
[SPEAKER_04]: like from India.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like an Indian rapper or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you've heard the song.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like once you hear you that I've heard the
song, but this is the video I watched
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this, okay, this is wild,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like here, check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wild, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I never, I never thought it would be
that wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just, but I was watching it back
and I'm like, I really did just turn
[SPEAKER_04]: almost completely sideways with one hand,
just kind of not in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: like smashing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going like 95 in that video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and it's just like, I don't realize
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, like I've watched them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just don't really, I guess I never
like realized it until today or yesterday
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever, but I was just like wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a few years on you and I've been
thinking about this question a lot and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one thing I ask all my guests,
but if you were able to meet your younger
[SPEAKER_02]: self and give them one piece of advice,
what would that piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay in school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't not stay in school.
[SPEAKER_04]: I graduated high school, but go to
college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I know I have a really good job now,
but it's, I don't, I love my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, but like I work
construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work manual labor, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like it's rough on my body and like I
really like it, but I know when I'm like
[SPEAKER_04]: 65, 70, it's going to be rough for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, I wish I could tell myself
to just still have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't like, don't do as many dumb things
as I did, but definitely like go to
[SPEAKER_04]: college, try to get a degree and try to do
something where you're not killing
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, but don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my job, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great, it's a great place to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great job, but I think like,
especially now like seeing like everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to be like an influencer.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, nobody wants to do construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to do construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to go to college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to, they either want to go to
college and play in the NFL, like play a
[SPEAKER_04]: sport in college or like go be a doctor or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like, I wish I would have went to
school and actually did something like,
[SPEAKER_04]: not like to say that matters, but like
that matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what I do matters, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause people wouldn't, like I w I work in
water, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So people wouldn't be able to drink
without me fixing their water,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if everything hits the fan,
like it's a necessity at the end of the
[SPEAKER_04]: day, you have to have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if you didn't have water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you have to have it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you need me, but at the same
time, like there's a lot of cool people
[SPEAKER_04]: that do a lot of cool stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even if you go to college,
like for film, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even like setting up this whole
podcast type thing, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: To be the guy behind the screens,
like shower the people behind the screens,
[SPEAKER_04]: running the whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our producer went to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like shout out those people like that can
go and you, you know, the people like
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd get to meet, like even if you like
say just for producing writer,
[SPEAKER_04]: just for editing the people's stuff,
you get to work on the stuff, the people
[SPEAKER_04]: you get to meet, even if it was music,
like the songs you get to be a part of,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like to do stuff like that would have
been cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would have told myself is go
to school and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when I was young, man, I had no idea
what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was partying all the time and how just
having fun living life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of nothing's changed as you can tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still just full throttle all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but that'd be a thing for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it sounds super cliche cause you
know, but it is, it's, it is something
[SPEAKER_04]: like me personally, I still might go back
to college and you're young.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can still go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I still want to go back to college
and get a degree and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know maybe a career change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've changed careers a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there it's never too late to start
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never late to show up on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's a live by right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ain't lying, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would, that'd be it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if people are looking to find out
about you, you have a bunch of channels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you got Instagram, Instagram,
TikTok, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all Vandy's 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of, there's been a lot of
fake accounts out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got like Spotify playlists and Apple
playlists and there's, you can check all
[SPEAKER_04]: those out in my bio, but a lot of people
make fake one of those too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, I'm all, I'm all over every
social media platform you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on there and even Facebook cause it's
linked to my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone wants to sponsor you,
yeah, they could, they could reach out to
[SPEAKER_04]: me and DME on Instagram or that's usually
what I check the most is my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like TikTok, I feel super old saying this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know how to check the
messages on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really know how to work it too
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try my best, but you reach out to me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely, I try to check those daily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys, if you're trying to get in
touch, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for coming by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming on the show today.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't smoke with him today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have brought some mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have been on cloud nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably would have been sleeping here
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got drivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, we'll have to do this again
soon when you can smoke, when they change
[SPEAKER_04]: the laws or when you're done with your
job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
