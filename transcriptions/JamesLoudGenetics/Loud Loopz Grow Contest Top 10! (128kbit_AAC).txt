[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is James Loud, and we are going to
review some of the entries that were
[SPEAKER_00]: turned in for the contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the top 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've eliminated eight out of the entries,
and we have 10 to go on for the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to spend time going
with each one, individually, smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting, comparing what I think is the
best against the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people entered five phenotypes,
some people entered one phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they hand-selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy trying all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a good amount of
phenotypical variation between all these
[SPEAKER_00]: entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting because we have
different densities, so some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is denser, some of the stuff is obviously
tighter, and some of the stuff is bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some real chunky nugs here,
like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some amazing turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the board, we got really,
really, really good turps, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the color, there's a wide
amount of color, and I think that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to do with nutrition and environment
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff is a little premature,
at least the other entries that were
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them were on the premature side,
but some of these are totally done,
[SPEAKER_00]: done and amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not disqualifying people for seeds,
so if the bud is seeded, as long as it
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes and smells good, I'm okay with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, the most important
thing for me is not structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not yield, is not THC content,
but is flavor and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be doing a lot of blind tasting
with these entries, and we're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making some judges kits that are going
out, so yeah, these in no order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk a little bit about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a little premature,
actually, this number one, but I kept it
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the turps, even though it has a
little hay smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure's amazing, and I'm sure it's
gonna smoke good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a real underlying candy smell to
it, which I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these came across real creamy,
like this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has heavy gas and heavy cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of big, buds like this in
there, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a good amount of color,
and we're talking about Zerios times ZBX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zerios is steel milk times Zerbert,
and ZBX is a Skittles back cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like this right here, this is nice and
dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is everything that everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll smoke it and make sure it checks
those boxes as well, but as far as from a
[SPEAKER_00]: visual, aspect, I mean, the size of these
nugs, these are fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trimming, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the sugar leaf, dude, there's some
leaves that are just coated and caked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we got some of the people that
entered smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller buds are okay, especially when
they're frosted like this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like super frosty,
and this has a friggin' awesome candy turp
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, it's kind of skittly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lemon-lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of, you know, goes in and kind of
burns your nostrils a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was one of the softer buds on
this number five right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frosty, but this leans towards the
cereal milk a lot more than some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice, though, as far as you get
candy on the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of the Twizzlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has a Twizzlers smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell it was soil-grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say this is living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know firsthand who is what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all this stuff blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fat bud right here, it knuckles out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyx kind of stack, and it was
trimmed really well as far as the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has like almost a candy necklace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys remember the
candy necklace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a candy necklace turp in
there, along with some gas and some cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I would definitely enjoy trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that comes across in the smoke,
man, that's a great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're announcing the winners next week on
the show on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,000 grand prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,000 goes to charity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charity of your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another definitely like living soil,
cured out perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here has a muskiness to it
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: An underlying candy turps has like a nice
skittly kind of finish to it that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one is a sleeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this entry right here,
number eight, is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sleeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like it's that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It honestly looks mediocre compared to the
other ones, but it has a really good turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of Skittles as far
as the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a lot of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is actually sticky, but as far as
like it's not nearly as frosted up as some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times when you're breeding
with something like Skittles, the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: turpene profile is associated with the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're breeding stuff together with
Skittles, you're going to get stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks amazing if you breed it with
something like Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want the skittly side of it,
you're going to have to deal with stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not necessarily as frosty,
that doesn't have as nice of a structure
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes to get the turpene profile that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got number nine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, rock hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one kind of reminds me of Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is when you're
phenohunting, and you're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: these different buds, this is basically a
phenohunt, although I'm growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you want a phenohunt in the same
room, so you give each different seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one in the progeny, its own chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of the plants its own chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're doing a phenohunt with several
different environments basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not on an even playing field
because someone might get lucky with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to hit the lottery,
and they're going to get the winner,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're going to have the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number 10, beautiful structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like everything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of old school Bubba
Kush structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number 10, where the calyx swell up
at the end, where they absorb almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little orange hairs basically go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they get eaten up.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG is classic and infamous for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely comes from that Afghanica
side somewhere over there, like the Hindu
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great example of another one
where as it swells, you don't see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot more trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is freaking small little bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packs a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting that almost like a Flintstone
vitamin candy out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really nice, really approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this one will smoke great in a
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these ones have a really good chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be testing some stuff,
and I'll be reporting back next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be giving prizes to all the top 10
contestants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winner gets $10,000, and $10,000 goes
to charity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second place, they're going to
get a Focus V Carta 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get one of those along
with a DAB applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got t-shirts for all the top 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these people that are right in
front of me, they're going to be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate all these amazing
entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the level of something I
haven't seen, even with high times,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're up there with the high times
cup competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck to the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys very much.
