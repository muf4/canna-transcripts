[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, my special guest is Ricky Palamino.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a steward of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kept the OG Kush variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's had the Ricky's Brothers Kush alive
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting to meet him in person
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have mutual friends like Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've heard a lot of stories and I'm
really interested in getting down to it
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing really good, actually,
and thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to do these often,
but when I do, I really enjoy telling a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of my story and I really
appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's great to finally meet you in
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your genetics are legendary and I really
want to get to the bottom of how it all
[SPEAKER_02]: started with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some stuff to this story that I've
never told, which I will, because I only
[SPEAKER_00]: recently found out about some of the
background to the genetic itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I started smoking in the
seventh grade and I'm 55 now, so that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gives you an idea of how long I've been
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was 81?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 81, 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget the first time I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It put me on my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know where I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the fuck was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to go underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first year of junior high
school, so we used to go underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: cafeteria and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the smoke would go up into the
cafeteria and the people working could
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it and stuff, but they didn't know
where it was coming from because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the school cafeteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I enjoyed it after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paranoia never really hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would always say, oh, the first
time I smoked it, I got paranoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That never happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt incredibly slow and I kind of
liked that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of relaxed me, but it was like
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the first thing I ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, and Colombian is typically known for
its strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that was funny is I don't
recall it being smooth at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recall it being incredibly harsh,
but that's what we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to get it from this guy named
George.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call him Lumbo George because
that's all he used to have was Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first thing I smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I remember someone had some chocolate
tie and I was like, oh, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little by little, I started discovering
that there were other strains of- Where
[SPEAKER_01]: was this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in Marina Del Rey Junior High
School and down in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I maintained the smoking pretty much from
that point all the way through high
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I ended up in the army and I stayed
in the army for 10 years from 1986 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really smoke then.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that time period, you obviously
really couldn't get away with it because
[SPEAKER_00]: the military would drug test you and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much had stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once I got out, I was reintroduced to
the new flavors that were now existing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued to smoke and then I started
working in the music industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working for the band Suicidal
Tendencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those guys in the band really did
anything, but I still maintained it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, I graduated to working
for Snoop Dogg and I started working with
[SPEAKER_00]: him in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when my smoking really went through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy, wow, he smokes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Puts it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I really started to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I came across this beautiful
plant, the 98 Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother was growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started working for Snoop in
2000, he had still been growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop had asked me, hey, can you get any
bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, from my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought some to him and he was like,
oh, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can get more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, good, bring it on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was his road manager, so I would bring a
couple of pounds, but it would go really
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: How fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, I would say we'd go through a
pound at least in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not all Snoop smoking it to
the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: His typical day would be like,
I'll roll a blunt and he'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: While he's smoking it, he's rolling up
another one and he takes the one that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: just lit and passes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes around the corner and now
everybody's smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went quickly because he shared the
wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this experience came, I need to get
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, we're in freaking
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I supposed to get it here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Adam Dunn, of all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately called him and said,
hey, bro, can you do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you this genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can strategically place it in a few
areas across the country for me and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it out, this would be really helpful so
then I'm never running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put it in a few different spots and
actually took it to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Amsterdam for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just kept it going for the entire run
that I was with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always have a little bit here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met AJ Sauer Diesel in that process and
he was growing it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the funny thing is, is a couple years
into this, let's say 2002, 2003,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose, everyone had lost the genetic,
including my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just one that I was responsible for
sourcing the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately for Adam, keeping it alive,
we had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother was growing it with Wonder
Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was growing it with Kenji from Dr.
Green Thumb.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, they had all lost it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really said anything to anyone and
I only found out that those three guys had
[SPEAKER_00]: it recently when I was talking to my
brother about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you get this from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that he had got it from
Wonder Brett.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a deal where my brother worked on
his place doing some electrical work and
[SPEAKER_00]: the deal was, hey, I'll do your electrical
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how my brother ended up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before my brother gave it to me,
he said, hey, bro, I'm not supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: give this to anybody, but I'll trust you
that you're not going to put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market or do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, I got a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not interested in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's how it all came about and
then recently when I found out the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: story, I actually went back to Wonder
Brett and I went to Josh and I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenji and I gave it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt it was important that the guys who
started it all had it, but in the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting it to Adam, he had asked me,
he says, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it's Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, well, kind of Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, fuck, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is it sells for like six to
8,000 a pound right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all, well, where did you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I got it from my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He named it Ricky's brother's Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He coined the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's so good at marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a collaboration together.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just, he's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, you know, a couple of
years ago he said, Rick, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we wish we're still the only ones that I
know of that currently have this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should start a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, okay, what do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kind of talked it out and
figured out that there was a story behind
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that we could market it in such a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started to do something here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working with the guys who had a
place called Funkadelic Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of years ago, when they had
those big fires in the Santa Rosa area and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, the farm went up in smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of like held me up and I was
like, oh crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see what if I could do
something else with someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked out another deal with a
company down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't name their name because they
pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up like in a really bad
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just trying to steal the genetic
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I discovered some things about the
industry, you know, and building the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really can't come out the shoot
with just one thing on one skew and really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of do something successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really kind of like have to breed with
it and do other things and cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam and I had discussed it and he
started making crosses with it and started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're ramping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Michigan, I'm actually launching
Ricky's California originals with several
[SPEAKER_00]: different mutations of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going MSO too, I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like that's the ultimate goal is
to try to get it into various places and
[SPEAKER_00]: working under a bigger umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited because now I know the ins
and outs of what's going on, who to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for, who not to look for, what,
you know, how to promote something,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to like really, what would you say,
curate properly what people really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cause I consider this like,
you know, it's a top tier, but in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, you know, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it will always come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like OG is a staple that will
always be popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, sometimes it'll be
the most popular thing and other times it
[SPEAKER_02]: won't be quite as popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we forget, I think it's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, some people may get it
to yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had success getting OG Kush to
yield very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, that's one of the
challenges, but now purple bud is
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants purple bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not that I'm not a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan of all of it, but OG Kush
definitely has a place in my heart and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of other people,
it's just one of those things that it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like sour is another challenging
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a longer flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So question for you, the name OG Kush,
what's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different opinions on
where it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your insight on the fact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard Kenji talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the specifics of it,
but I don't think they used OG as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean grown or organic grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was all these things that
people were saying, but it really just
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to like, it's the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, this is the one that started it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I always looked at it is
that it just meant that it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything you mentioned too,
in terms of like how it's grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's growing it, like the various levels
of it, like the gentleman that grew it,
[SPEAKER_00]: grew this, they have a company called
third eye organics and they do everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they grow it to a level
that I really hadn't seen in a long,
[SPEAKER_00]: long time in terms of the quality and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen other people grow it and I'm
like, dude, this isn't Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mush.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, if you don't grow it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extremely from what I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as far as like, if you don't grow
it really well, it doesn't come out great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't come out with the turps quite
as perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could hit it one time and get a
perfect 10 and it's checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next time you grow it,
it's not quite as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's some people that
perfected it, but I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day grew one specific flavor
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everyone wants to grow this,
this round, this, this round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they, they quit
perfecting those individual flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're not seeing a ton of good OG
Kush around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Brian from Vital gave me some a
while back that he's kept the clone alive
[SPEAKER_02]: for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really piney.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing with OG is it's got
that pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's the, that's what I love about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's like a fine cigar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have that like Pine Saul,
old school flavor smell, like that to me
[SPEAKER_00]: is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm not a fan of, you know,
ice cream cake and all these other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: even gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really a fan of, you know,
I'm like, if I want something to be sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, or like I'll go eat a bowl of
cereal or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want my weed to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be that pine, that,
that taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did notice this huge trend of,
you know, all the people wanting color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I don't really personally get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have tried some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try a really, really great cut of
the original blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's funny cause there's an original
blueberry from Oregon and then there's DJ
[SPEAKER_02]: shorts blueberry and they get interchanged
and one is a sativa and one is an indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like both of them for different
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I grew the original back in
the day in my garage in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was this massive spear of a
plant, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas DJ shorts is a shorter bushier
plant that they both have blueberry turps
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're both great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I never thought that I would
like something again that tasted like a
[SPEAKER_00]: food cause it literally smells like a
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, but I did enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like, I think I might still have had
the the indica side of it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: really was a heavy, like high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, a lot of people consider
OG Kush a sativa from one perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I feel like it's a hybrid and it has
this sedative effects of an indica,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's very uplifting as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those flavors that I feel
like I can smoke in the morning and the
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon and night and still get the same
great effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush is a little different in my
opinion, in the sense that your palate
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't adapt to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some other things where like after
two weeks, you got to smoke something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's really good OG, you're going to
smoke it till it's gone and you can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like with experience and
experienced growers and cultivators and
[SPEAKER_02]: smokers, that OG Kush is just one of those
things that we enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as you mentioned earlier,
you know, when guys were growing back
[SPEAKER_00]: then, they were growing specifically one
style, you know, so everybody kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: shared their recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone knew to grow it at a certain
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's what I enjoyed back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if my brother didn't have it,
if I needed it from Kenji, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh at the time and I didn't know Wonder
Brett, but I knew that people could get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, again, once it was consistent
between that core group, it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I did so-and-so doesn't have it,
but so-and-so does and it's equally as
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do notice that this particular plant
even growing outdoor though, if it's grown
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, it's fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it might even be better than indoor
in some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Terps, the Terps, I feel like outdoor,
if you do it right, I think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something to be said for those guys that
do the soil grown and then they use,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of the guys that do guano
and stuff like that or seagull shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seagull shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's a new one to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys in NorCal that do, yeah,
I mean, it's just, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these guys, and it makes it
taste a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste like seagull shit,
obviously just like guano, but it
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely brings out the flavor and
brings out a unique characteristic to it
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very distinct in certain regions,
you know, of Mendo and of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are doing some really cool
stuff and the real OG guys that are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing OG get these amazing expressions
and those guys still get top dollar for
[SPEAKER_02]: their bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my friend down in LA,
shout out to Mark Strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has, he grows aquaponically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his stuff comes out even different from
the outdoor, from the typical hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way his strains come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a fucking amazing original Indiana
bubble gum cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called sour gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he has an OG to himself that's
called Scoopio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is again, it's another, it's like a
Skittles cross with an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one is another one that I really
like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are doing Skittles OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people are doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a handful of guys doing
it right where it's not diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not where it's like a weaker version
of the skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to be Terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be Terpy, whether it's OG or
Skittles or a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both so uniquely strong in flavor
that it's got to have a punch to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His, his Scoopio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoopio has exactly what you describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that really nice smell too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, ah, we just did a, we did a
back cross or not a back cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did a cross with a chem dog,
double D and some of the Finos were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of had a hazy smell, you know,
and we're like, where's this smell coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them were like,
dude, it's like, you just opened up a jar
[SPEAKER_00]: of pine salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one, this is the one we want,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, we're excited about some of
these crosses and we're hopefully we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: get a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan is where we'll launch first with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately we'll, I'll bring them
back out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the California market I'm discovering
too is who this place is insane to get
[SPEAKER_00]: things going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, with between taxation
and competition and everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, it's like, this is a really hard
market to break into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never flood it, but in order for
you to get into it and make a staple for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, we're still in the
infancy of legalization, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as recreational, you know,
and it's not even legal on a federal
[SPEAKER_02]: level, but eventually it's going to
stabilize a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be easier for people to
break into or harder depending on how you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it, but it's definitely going to
stabilize a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now it's just so unstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes up one year down the next year,
you know, and in one month to the next,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm noticing too, it's like,
it's not really so much, like I saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrity brands coming out, you know,
but unless you're doing it, like the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: in Dr. Green thumb, where your artist
that's actually backing it is entrenched
[SPEAKER_00]: in the culture, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm backed by quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where a lot of guys were
like, I got a big name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to jump in and throw my name out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't back it with quality,
you're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pointless, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's weird too, because I've noticed
the difference in marketing in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: rock and roll bands trying to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hip hop guys trying to get
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hip hop guys, like the culture flipped
too, because remember back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm a huge metal head, you know,
for somebody who worked in hip hop for as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as I did, I never really listened to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, black Sabbath, ACDC,
you know, I love punk rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sepultura is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like all that stuff, uh,
mega death, all, everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: metal or rock was my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember the artists from the
seventies, smoking weed was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, black Sabbath, sweet leaf,
you know, all this stuff you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you'd see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here comes the eighties and the
nineties with music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they stopped really talking about
smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of like faded away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hip hop guys came in with
like, you know, wearing a fucking outfit
[SPEAKER_00]: made of blunt wraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just pushing, pushing and pushing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but I have seen that the
guys that are trying to get into the game
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hip hop world are starting to see
the same thing that the, if you don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not really all about it and
you're just in it for the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumers see that and they just
don't, it doesn't resonate into sales and
[SPEAKER_00]: then rock and roll guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen Ozzy had a, had a line,
uh, anthrax, I think had a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motorhead had a line, but you don't ever
see these guys smoking on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, you don't see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are public about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of consumers out there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hip hop guys, they're,
they're all about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smoking in every it's part of the,
yeah, it's, it's directly part of their
[SPEAKER_02]: culture and influence on their music.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it influences the rock guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't push it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and where they used to,
again, they used to be a part of the music
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flip and I won't even say a flip
because hip hop didn't really exist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies in the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started, you know, getting more popular
as the eighties went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, just the trend of who
was pushing what and what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hip hop guys took it to a whole new
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he took it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give that guy so much credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's in the sense of what he was
willing, the bullets he was willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: take for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he put himself out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did not give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I commend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like, you know, Snoop is another
one, obviously that really started doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I, I have to put B as the front
runner in terms of what he was able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really just putting himself out there
and not giving a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back in the nineties when
Cypress Hill was like all about the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: people throwing fucking joints on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you got other shows where
girls are throwing their panties in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cypress Hill shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're doing that too,
but they're throwing massive amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were the first ones actually
that like really did not give a fuck about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the funny thing is around
the same time there was Pantera,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pantera, so I was in a medal back in
the day too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, you know, I love all aspects of
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pretty much no genre that I can't
appreciate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pantera back in the day, they were all
about weed too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dimebag back in the day smoking
rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimebag, you can't get that name if you
don't, if you don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then it kind of, it didn't die
with them, but it definitely didn't evolve
[SPEAKER_02]: and grow into kind of what hip hop has
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, you know, I won't name names,
but I knew, I do know quite a few of these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that hit me up and like, Hey bro,
can you hook me up with some bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming through town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they won't flaunt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't put them on the spot and say,
Oh, I know so-and-so smokes or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wish they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they would for the culture and for
the, you know, getting it normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: By people by saying, look at what these
guys are capable of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, alcohol, I think alcohol is
synonymous with metal.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has become a part of that,
that culture, getting drunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: having that Jack Daniel's, you know,
I mean, Dime Pantera were legendary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard they used to have like a personal
bartender that traveled with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: would just be mixing drinks on stage for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, they had some old videos
on VHS tapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, of them, you know, constantly
puking, they were smoking weed and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: too, you know, but like constantly getting
so hammered that they were thrown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that's a lot of
culture that was very, very public.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very public about the alcohol,
whereas I think alcohol is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: widespread, but as far as an alternative
to alcohol, weed is such a better option.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I mean, you know, we never discussed
obviously until I would say maybe within
[SPEAKER_00]: the last nine years where people really
started talking about the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never recall it being a topic of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been using it since 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that purpose, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I don't recall it ever being
like part of the real conversation in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of what people wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I saw it started to go
illegal, people said, oh, it's medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in the Bay Area, medical was a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Dennis Perrone said it's medical,
whether you believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always I've I've used that to
my I've used that on my parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used that on a million other people
that smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really gotten more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and I think a lot of that was 60
minutes when Sanjay Gupta came on and was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, look at this kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we give him this, you know,
this medicine that's made from a plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: he has seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he doesn't have seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you argue with a parent that wants
to give their kid, you know, plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that changed my parents mind 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think in most people,
if you were to watch that, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: deny the fact that if you give a kid
medicine, you know, that that's your right
[SPEAKER_02]: to give a kid medicine that heals your
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I hate that the government wants
to get in the way of these kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering that, you know, from what I've
I've read in terms of like cannabis being
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in medicine way back,
you know, when they used to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called snake oil salesmen running
around in the wild, wild west or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd see that that bottle of their
medicine and in there and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 20 percent cannabis or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was back around that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then you find out that they
you were not allowed to do scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: research on the plant and like completely
outlawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then you find out that
around the world, that wasn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but even 2000 years ago, you know,
and more than that, you know, we've used
[SPEAKER_02]: it as plant medicine for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said Steve D'Angelo on a couple of weeks
ago, he has a retreat in Jamaica where
[SPEAKER_02]: they expose you to plant medicine and
teach you all kinds of cool stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the the Hemp Museum in
Amsterdam, you find out you could make a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking car out of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do so many things with converted
into energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hemp creed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think these are all the future
future endeavors, too, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are working on it now,
but I think it's going to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the personal, I guess you could
say, opinion of that might sound kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: conspiracy to the whole thing is I believe
the reason it was placed in such a
[SPEAKER_00]: category where people weren't allowed to
do certain because anyone could fucking do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's not how capitalists
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to be able to monopolize
what's out there and you can't let the
[SPEAKER_00]: average person really prosper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give everyone the opportunity
to do it, suddenly no one can be the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one can find and benefit financially of
it unless you squash that ability to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal opinion, because it
makes no sense otherwise why it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: outlawed and illegal for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it was racially motivated
and also a movement against the hippies,
[SPEAKER_02]: the long hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, coming down to it,
if you, you know, it could be racially
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated, but that's also financially
motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Racially motivated in a certain level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's sad, unfortunately,
but it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hope the government gets its
head out of its ass and legalizes it
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to, it needs to be at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be, and descheduling is what
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the schedule three thing is
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said it, I've said it a bunch of
times over the last few months,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You de-schedule it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't schedule tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't schedule alcohol in the same
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're controlled substances,
but they're not a scheduled drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then in Israel, they they're
like the only country on earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that has been doing actual
research about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's other places too,
but yeah, I mean, Israel is special
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's not as much red tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we're going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, I'm excited for the future of
cannabis in terms of what they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: discover it can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe it is a miracle plant in a
lot of ways that we still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still haven't tapped into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the opportunity to go to Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Beirut and I was considered to
be one of the few Westerners that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: got to walk the fields of cannabis where
they make all the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fields of plants, males,
females, didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just like as far as the
eye can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend who took me there,
he's a CEO of a really big oil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say who, um, you know,
he's, he's like, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I noticed as we were walking these
fields, there are these, um, portraits of
[SPEAKER_00]: martyrs hanging and I'm always what's,
what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, oh, that's a martyr from
Hezbollah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like Hezbollah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's all, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that here?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all, well, this crop is dedicated to
that martyr and whatever they make from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps finance part of their cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but then I got to watch how they do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they wear these huge suits of
leather and they walk through these fields
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the resin just kind of sticks to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they get done walking,
they go back to their shed and they scrape
[SPEAKER_00]: it all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they make their hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their hash was just out of this
fucking world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, but I started asking more and more
about the plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what there is a university in
Beirut that has been doing some testing
[SPEAKER_00]: and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're saying that that particular
strain, because it's a feral strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: has some amazing qualities that they're
discovering in it, but it hasn't been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, outside of Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I don't know a ton about Lebanon or
the studies they're doing, but I was in a
[SPEAKER_02]: taxi not so long ago and it was Lebanese
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, I smelled like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, so you, you smoked the
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started talking about Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, what are most Americans and
Europeans don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only know the red Lebanese hash,
but actually the green stuff is the best
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually green hash is garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, uh, I had two small blocks that,
I mean, I was only going to be there for a
[SPEAKER_00]: week and they gave me enough hash to last
me six fucking months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're all ready to have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what am I going to do with
all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take it with me, you know,
but I smoked it and there was a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I guess kind of like an olive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colored a hash and it was amazing,
but I didn't know what you said that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was the, you know, I didn't know the
qualities differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd only heard of red Lebanese that,
I mean, that's a, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Amsterdam, when I was there,
my friend has a collection of hash Soma
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had some red Lebanese at some point
when I was over there, maybe 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, you know, it's worth not to
change the subject, but we know where that
[SPEAKER_00]: big explosion happened in Lebanon a couple
of years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hotel was literally like, half a mile
from that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had I been there at that time,
I would have gotten fucked up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are wild over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful country though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can still see the devastation,
unfortunately, from some of the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've had with a few of the wars,
but the people like they really do kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like during the day, everyone gets
together and they mingle with one another
[SPEAKER_00]: and the traffic is kind of crazy and
everyone's going nuts and they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're drinking these tiny, small cups
of, uh, really, really strong coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but they'll like, you're in the
taxi, they'll, they'll drive up,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll stop for a second while they're
taking you to your destination and yell
[SPEAKER_00]: something out the window and a guy will
come over and give them a small little cup
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll drink it and then they'll take
off and they'll go like half a mile and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll pull over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're all amped up on shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, everyone is just so friendly,
but at night the lights go out,
[SPEAKER_00]: Christians go over here and Muslims go
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whoever, all the factions,
they separate and they're, they're no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer interacting with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the day, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's really friendly, really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta balance that hash out with
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the case at the end of the
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, break out that hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they are definitely amped up over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So describe the, the, the feral,
the wild cannabis that you saw,
[SPEAKER_02]: were they tall lanky plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got, I got pictures with my friend
standing in the fields where they're way
[SPEAKER_00]: tall above his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other plants that are
kind of, you know, maybe two, three feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, but you know, they're very,
again, males, females, uh, Sativa is Indic
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, it's just every seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reseeds the fields every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they also, they have these huge bags
of seeds and they don't, it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: they just throw them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a farmer that goes here,
put one here, six inches here,
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, they're just like, like for,
you know, feeding birds, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the watering process,
like it's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, they, they, they water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a rice paddy, they just flood the
shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets so hot there that they just
let it sit until it evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they flood it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much how they grow it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept walking around going,
you know, I think if you guys like took
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to get rid of some of these males
and had like crops of nothing but female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, it might turn out better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started thinking, well,
obviously what's better than what they
[SPEAKER_00]: already got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They obviously know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the quality of the product is,
it's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, you know, so however they
decided to do it is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they, they have their method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real interesting places like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'd be interesting to compare the
seed stock from 30 years ago to today and
[SPEAKER_02]: see how it's evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it looked, it looked ancient in
terms of how they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just have big like wheelbarrows
filled with fucking seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they literally just walk up,
scoop them all up into a bag and then take
[SPEAKER_00]: their walk through the field and just
starts throwing them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where else in the world have you been?
[SPEAKER_00]: God, you know, though I've been fortunate
enough to pretty much go from Iceland all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down to South Africa, from Japan
all the way down to New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few places I still haven't been
that I'm dying to go to, but I've had,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa hasn't been the, it's probably the
least explored continent that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nigeria being probably the absolute worst
of the worst of places that I've been to
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of cannabis and trying to get
stuff there, like just terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was the worst weed I'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like cow patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was terrible, terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa, Cape Town had the best bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really did out of the whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johannesburg wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turban poison was garbage that I tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the right people too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely did not enjoy that at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sardinia, Italy, you cannot find even a
gram of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you guys have hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this shit that you make this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't grow it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get all our hash shipped in from
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Italy was like, they had a big
CBD, you know, legalization and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing huge amounts of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD and plots of THC and some people
ruined it for everybody, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they banned CBD again, which is
kind of wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know a couple of guys in the country,
in certain cities, Milan, mainly that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a funny story on tour and I
don't mind telling this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in Sweden and I don't know if you
recall this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in 2007 or 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008 where Snoop had gotten arrested and
he had gotten arrested from a roadblock
[SPEAKER_00]: that the police had set up specifically
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was in a car and I don't remember
the young lady's name, but she was an
[SPEAKER_00]: artist from the country and no one knew
they were in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really funny that they set up
the roadblock to catch them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had called Adam when we first
landed saying, Hey man, I need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this guy flew in with a pound of
fucking weed and it was amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all at the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the show was over, I get a
phone call from the hotel telling me that
[SPEAKER_00]: the police are coming and they're going to
search all the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had just put Snoop in the car to
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get word from him directly
saying, Hey, I'm getting arrested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, call so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started making calls and I went,
wait a minute, I got to get back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they go into his room, they're going to
find that, that fucking pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I immediately get into a car,
take off to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops are in the lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't made their way up yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I race up to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to flush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now stupidest move ever because European
toilets don't swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pours water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weed is now just floating
everywhere in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm freaking out about what am I going
to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look and there's a trash can with the
bin in it or a liner in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed the liner and I scoop all the
weed out of the toilet and I run out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the balcony and I slung that fucker over
to the next building and it landed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, 10 minutes later,
the cops come up and they're fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: searching all the rooms and they didn't
find anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was like, what am I going to do if
they catch me in here with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is zero tolerance country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they really will fuck you hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that was always like a concern
of mine, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause part of my job was at not just being
the road manager, but also finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, the shit that I would have to do,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you, like I've, I would take a
private car to Christiana if we were near
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere near Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would go and I would literally buy
out the whole fucking city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would walk in there going,
Oh, that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much you got to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we only have 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I only have five grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, give me that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would literally go from merch to
merch per person, just buy everything they
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking had and then sneak out,
get back in the private car and link up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it would be, Hey, Adam, there's nobody
we know in Estonia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know anything in Estonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would take a train, go into
Amsterdam, get some stuff from him,
[SPEAKER_00]: jump back on the train with the fucking
suitcase of weed, link up with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was things like that happened
constantly in Europe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never really worried about it,
even though it was illegal in some places
[SPEAKER_00]: like Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always weed somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always some good stuff someplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: My shout out to my guy, red beard up in
Salt Lake city too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, Snoop show though,
there's going to be people bringing weed
[SPEAKER_02]: in for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would, but it was always like
that hit and miss, you know, people show
[SPEAKER_00]: up with Booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to smoke weed with Snoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's like the number one thing
that people want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I gotta, I gotta unfortunately
screen you buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see what you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, you can't even smoke with me with
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this was a funny one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chief of police came up to me before
the show in Auckland and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: if a Snoop Dogg smokes on stage,
we're not going to arrest him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to arrest you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the show started, I'm hearing,
you know, the music going and we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversation or I'm having this
conversation with the chief of police in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dressing room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear, you know, the music go on and
I'm like, fuck, I gotta go run to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and tell them, don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've raced to the stage and the show's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hitting the DJ on the back and I'll
jam, get his attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jam, who was the DJ at the time,
gets Snoop's attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop comes over and I'll Snoop,
listen, I just had a conversation with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chief of police.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke on stage, they're going to
arrest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shit you not bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally looks at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grabs his blunt, grabs the lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, don't worry, Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got bail money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went out there and fucking lit that
shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not getting arrested for
this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately that cop, I guess was just
giving me the scare tactic cause he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: come get me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So New Zealand's got an interesting scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're super passionate about
cannabis over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're God's gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is what they really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's their staple from what I
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been there in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few years, but I remember everybody
talking about, oh yeah, we have God's
[SPEAKER_00]: gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have, you know, so,
uh, catch a fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys tour with Marlin and then
played some shows and those we smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: backstage and they've got their own,
uh, special, special rigs where they have
[SPEAKER_02]: a hot knives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's attached to the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it heats up the knives and then you
push it together and it pushes the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then you, you hit it with
the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, uh, my really good friend,
John, he's a native New Zealander Maori
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, he's all Rick, come on,
mate, we gotta do the knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, the knives, what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you've never done the knives,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, never at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'd go to the kitchen and he
grabbed two butter knives and throw them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat them up until they're super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he rolls up a cone out of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all here, put this in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the fuck am I supposed to
do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a watch bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'd grab the weed with the hot
knives, squeeze it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you inhale it through the cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do that with old school hash,
but these New Zealanders will do it with
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's a strong, but it's very,
it's nostalgic from younger years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's still pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that shit would put me on my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be couch writing it after smoking
it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be coughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he would make like little balls of
weed, you know, and then that he would
[SPEAKER_00]: literally touch the one with one knife and
it would stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he grabbed the other one and
sandwich it together to get the burn and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it right in front of the cone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, these guys had it attached to the
torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would turn the torch on and it
would heat it and then press.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's inventive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that's definitely a modern
version of how my friend John showed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do that in Australia though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the funny part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's, it's a New Zealand thing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia has got its own, you know,
their own ways of doing stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're super passionate about weed as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in the Adelaide area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they seem to have like really
it's, it's, I think, uh, I think it might
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that it's definitely medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure about rec, but I definitely
think Australia's medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since I've been there,
but they definitely were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the front runners of the
country in terms of growing it and having
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can go to Sydney and get some,
but it would be something shipped in from
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of like all the same
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of the stuff in Perth,
those guys seem to have, like taken more
[SPEAKER_00]: pride in what they were growing there,
but definitely Adelaide was the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I haven't been back to Australia
since 2013 or 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure in the last 10 years,
things have changed quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but back then that's what, what it was
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to Australia, but I have
friends that come to Spannabis every year
[SPEAKER_02]: I bump into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spannabis is the more than most amazing
events and you're going to have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been, I definitely want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chip, but yeah, in 2024,
I think it's more, 14th, 15th and 16th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I go every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it's just amazing adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I see my friends from all around
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got friends from Australia,
South Africa, uh, guys from Japan that I
[SPEAKER_02]: see every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you smoked Japanese weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my friend Sushi, uh, shout out to
Sushi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, uh, he would hook us up, but it
smelled and tasted like ocean water,
[SPEAKER_00]: like seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's where they grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it in the harbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would like, it was so close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they were actually using
salt water, but it had that and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: hell expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, ah, I don't quote me on this,
but I want to say it was like almost 1600
[SPEAKER_00]: to $2,000 for an ounce because they were
so afraid that one gram will land you
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the, the punishment was extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing it, you had to get top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was amazing looking weed,
but it absolutely smelled like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it tasted like seaweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're from LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is that what I call pretendica that
came out a lot in the, I feel like the LA
[SPEAKER_02]: market is full of a lot of that stuff that
looks fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not going to name any brands,
but some of their stuff looks fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you see it on Instagram or
whatever, or you see it in the bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you go to smell it and it smells
okay, but you go to smoke it and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: no Terps or, you know, I mean,
a lot of stuff is salt grown and whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's the, the, I'm talking about
the commercially produced stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: not like the small farmer, but you know,
there's, cause you can get it to look
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, but it's all about taste and
effect at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: On some level, I don't even really care
what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets me high and it tastes fucking
amazing, like the look is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the same way, you know, and I've,
I've seen plenty of that down in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't just say LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that in a few areas where it's,
it's lacking something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's missing something and whether they
overdid it with the salts just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to get a lot of yield or
they're doing something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, do they want it to look right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not hitting the mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a lack of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's all, you know, there's
something else that they're not doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives it that punch, but there's plenty of
stuff out there that's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you say in the commercial market,
which I think is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's someone's first, uh,
experience in cannabis and they're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: something based on what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, and then it's kind of like a
double-edged sword because I also feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like those guys that really take pride in
doing what they do and really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: build, you know, make the top shelf of top
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general customer right now is not,
doesn't have the money to pay for it or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, don't doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll buy that $10 eighth because they
just want something to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might buy your top shelf,
but they won't buy in quantity because
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll buy some other stuff at a lower
price to kind of mix it, to make it last
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed it in Colorado where you
could have the best guys out there
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, but the market doesn't dictate a
fine connoisseur bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll buy anything as long as it's at
the right price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of, kind of has the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a weird place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other thing is like
everyone's looking here, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what's the THC content?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some shit that was like 18% that
put me on my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some shit that is 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, you know, it's not always about
that number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people are so blinded by that
number and same thing with terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think terpene percentage is obviously
important, but it's specifically what kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of terpenes are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very specific to, you know,
distinct terpenes and also cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: and the way they affect each other,
you know, and then also your relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: with them, depending.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so subjective because cannabis in
general is just subjective to what you
[SPEAKER_02]: like and the effect that it gives you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're all so different as far as,
you know, body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's some people that smoke
haze and like for most of us, it gives us
[SPEAKER_02]: heart palpitations and our heart's beating
out of our chest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other people, it relaxes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's like, that's, that's one of
the signs where I look for that because of
[SPEAKER_00]: an unfortunate medical issue that I've
had, I have to maintain my blood pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've noticed that when I drink,
I smoke sativas, it really fucks with my
[SPEAKER_00]: blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smoke an indica, it's relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My blood pressure doesn't go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about edibles versus smokeables?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the thing about edibles for me
personally is I've never been able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, someone will say, Hey Rick,
you know, I got you these, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool cherries or whatever that are
five milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll eat like three or four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, I've got about 20
milligrams in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somebody else will show up and say,
Hey bro, I got these gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only 20 milligrams each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll eat one and I'll be like,
I'm hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this is way stronger than
fucking 20 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I feel there's an inconsistency
in how it's spread out within the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not a huge fan of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the ones that I've liked when I went
and reordered or went and got a re up of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, these aren't the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't taste the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the same effect,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my issue with edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back into the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you remember cat piss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's big debate going on
and there has been for a long time about
[SPEAKER_02]: who created whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally feel that it's a flavor
profile and there's probably multiple cat
[SPEAKER_02]: pisses, not just this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a SoCal cat piss from T dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's been on Adam Dunn's show.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a, he's quite the character.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to T dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and Jackson fire from SoCal,
but the one we had in the Bay was a more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sativa and the one they had in SoCal
was an Indica, very short plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and short flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one that my friends grew in the
Bay that had it was that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've recently talked to more people
about it was a sativa that was like more
[SPEAKER_02]: than 10 weeks, which is very much the
opposite, but they both had ammonia and
[SPEAKER_02]: they both had like heavy tiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think the SoCal one from my
understanding was more gas and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like strong pungent gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the NorCal was skunk and straight
ammonia, like nose burning tiles that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that really wake you up just
from sewing the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: See now my experience was very limited in
that because I didn't find that pleasant
[SPEAKER_00]: in the, in the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want to really like indulge
too much in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a lot of experience in
terms of smoking it, but that was my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with it was like, wow,
this is named appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fucking smells like cat piss and I
really don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of stayed away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we just did a cross of the RBK with
the sage and sour smells just like fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I was like, this might be
cool for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, I did a lot of sage and sour crosses
with Adam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd got some packs of T from th seeds of
Adam's sage and sour when he was working
[SPEAKER_02]: with Doug or whatever, and then pop those
and took, we made regular seeds for the
[SPEAKER_02]: sage against the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember him telling me about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of fun stuff, but that's a real
interesting one because I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing you with the RBK, you're just
putting more gas into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what we were hoping is like
with all the crosses that we were doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, he, he actually had another cross or
another strain called appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not familiar with the strain at
all, but apparently the curator of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer with us rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam happened to still have that
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we made that cross, I was really
excited because he said, Rick,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original was like, put you in a
catatonic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would literally be looking like
Keith Richards with your eyes closed and a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge ash because you'd fall asleep halfway
through smoking it, you know, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, Oh, I can't wait to see how
this turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fucking crystals every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, Oh my God, you look at this
thing, you go, wow, zero smell has no
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking smell at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the main thing that we
wanted to do with the crosses was like
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that a plant would take the smell
of the RBK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem is, is a lot of that stuff
is recessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes a lot of breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just in that initial cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually do some more work,
do it again and do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it took a long time before anybody
even had OG Kush seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you had, you, you just self
it and you got good OG Kush seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is from me watching the
industry seeing and being around people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And learning about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm, I'm not a cultivator,
but I do get the just of how things are
[SPEAKER_00]: created and how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, it's a, the breeding
process is not so simple as, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you find that phenome, do it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially with OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I think there's things like
gelato, for instance, where they made the
[SPEAKER_02]: gelato and it was like, okay, the 23 is
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 27 is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 33 is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 41, the 49, the 48, the 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things have their place,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's not always like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people think,
Oh yeah, I just did this and it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to, we're going to go through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it's a needle in a
haystack, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to be able to grow good enough
for it to express.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if you're not growing good
enough to express, you're wasting your
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I understand that there's a lot of
people out there that do that with,
[SPEAKER_00]: within the seed game where they do that
original thing and they find that one and
[SPEAKER_00]: they go, okay, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, they only do it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they found the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And immediately they say, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start, you know, mass producing
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, well, you really didn't
take the time to really find out if that
[SPEAKER_00]: really is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they get lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times you might be
overlooking some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you did find something amazing,
but you didn't grow it out multiple times
[SPEAKER_02]: along with other stuff, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know AJ, he's been doing some
really amazing crosses with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a strain called, I told him he
needed a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard he's selling seeds too,
but he only does it in person for cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's AJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does have, I told me he needed to
change the name, but he calls it new
[SPEAKER_00]: carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, new carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't sound appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no one wants to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine burning a new carpet and
smoking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, he goes, but it smells like I
go, yeah, but change the name,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not doing yourself any favors
by calling it new carpet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does have some really intriguing
crosses that he's been making.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's supposed to send me some seeds of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do, and I pop them, I'll let you
know what we're sitting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's, he's been raving about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the RBK and crossed it with like,
I can't even tell you to be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you, what ones, cause he mentioned them to
me, but it's like four other different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fuck, you went crazy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, I did, but it came out
great, Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't wait to see what he actually
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's, he's old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the old school chems,
you know, chem lineage, all the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: from, uh, from G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's doing, you know, like his stuff
is getting ready to hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the end of next month or so he's
got a deal in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where he's at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, New York's going to
pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to struggle out there,
you know, up to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how they've opened the flood
gates to do it, but with no real
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a free for all right now
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys who've actually paid all the
money to get the farms are stuck with
[SPEAKER_00]: their product because there's no stores
taking it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it gets moving in the right
direction, I do believe that New York is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a place where you can make
some decent money in this business and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some companies out there that
sold me on their hopes and dreams and have
[SPEAKER_02]: yet to pay me the money they owe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately for the time being,
I think it'll change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's going to change and you
know, I wish them well and I hope they
[SPEAKER_02]: have good luck and I hope they're
successful so that they can pay me.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great having you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are interested in finding more
about you and your brand, where would they
[SPEAKER_02]: go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do have, I haven't been really
active on it yet because I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating on like the whole revamp of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I originally, I have an IG account
beyond IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't have anything that I've
been using to promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only been promoting it as Ricky's
Brothers Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I've actually have come
across some of the original cuts of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things and making the back
crosses, I'm starting Ricky's California
[SPEAKER_00]: Originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually have about 20 strains that
I'll be coming to market with in various
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, whether it's through seed,
through clone, through actual flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realized that in order to create a
brand, again, you have to have quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: assortment because you really just can't
do it with one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it used to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I found that I felt like,
okay, I can succeed with this with Adam
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you can do it with just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the guys with the Paris OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use them as a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys came out to shoot with just
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they fucking crushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Runtz, Paris, these guys came out with one
thing and they hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hit and they knew what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely had it going, but that's
no longer the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, and I realized,
unfortunately I missed that boat and
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to really establish myself in
that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing it now, I'm realizing,
you know, you got to cater to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have that hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have that sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have that indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really look at the market as a
whole and say, I'm going to offer you a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of stuff because everyone's also
got different tastes, different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have something that you can
pivot in so many different directions and
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants to work with OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of that comes from a
conversation also that Be Real had on his
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast where he said he felt that OGs
were going to make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been the rumor for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs and Sour's making a comeback,
but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think especially on that
boutique, you know, top tier market that
[SPEAKER_02]: the people are all talking, you know,
if you had real sour, real OG,
[SPEAKER_02]: it still should fetch the price of all the
purple stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred percent, one hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so I to go back to your original
question, what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to revamp things in the sense
of Ricky's California originals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to launch in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already being grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do it there first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people that I'm working with there
are like family to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in a really great scenario and
situation there with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, I'm also working with Cordae
Brodis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting a company with my friend
Casey over there where we've all started a
[SPEAKER_00]: company called Hippie Era, where we're
going to launch clothing along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be using some of the
strains that I have to help him launch his
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's very much, you know, a
connoisseur of the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we can really do something good
in that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm probably going to keep things on a
very basic level with my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see myself as being like wanting
to take over the world with it or wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get in a couple of certain
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ultimately make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I think that if I
can make a profit and be able to help
[SPEAKER_00]: other people with some of the things that
are going on, I'm going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel better about just doing it in
general, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do it to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do it to be like,
oh, you're just doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if I can get into a situation
where I can help people through various
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, whether it be through charities,
through education, through other things
[SPEAKER_00]: where a passion driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I really want to sit within
the whole realm of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and I don't want to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm comfortable here,
you know, speaking with you and I'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: this with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a I'm really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a behind the scenes kind of guy,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't enjoy being in front of the
camera and speaking about my life story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one, but I can also find myself
getting in trouble because I do know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that I need to shut the fuck up
about and not talk about.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know me that I'll just start blabbing
and I might say something that'll get me
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's there's something to be
said about the old school smokers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: around your age.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking to obsolete the other
day and he was talking about how he likes
[SPEAKER_02]: being behind the curtains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you guys are both extremely
well spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're about the same age, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a long time for you to be able to
come out of the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys have a lot of experience,
a lot of great stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just extremely blessed to be able to
capture some of these stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, again, James, I truly appreciate you
having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, any time if you have
something else you want to discuss,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to absolutely 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as we I have I won't say a
wealth of experience in various things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I am world traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I have seen things through a
certain light and a certain view that I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, any subject, no matter what it
is, it could be political, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, anything you want to
talk about on a next trip or whatever down
[SPEAKER_00]: memory lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm open to talking about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that I would love to share that
that part of it with with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is what I've been able to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met some incredible people from Iran,
Russia, China, you know, everywhere around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world that I consider my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the one thing I do love
about this industry is it can bring people
[SPEAKER_00]: together and we can overcome certain
obstacles and we can open up lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: communication and get more understanding
with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that the plant helps with
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time, any time you want me,
I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, quick shout out to two one three
clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Andrew Bonarski told me to say
hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
Cruising.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
