[SPEAKER_04]: So we're here day one in Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at the Greenhouse Seed Company booth
with Dusts.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the Greenhouse guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're signing books.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This year Spannibus is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many people here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I haven't been to Spannibus this
crazy in at least 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are here at Spannibus and I'm with
Simon from Serious Seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of the big inspirations for this
book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to personally give this book to you
and I thank you so much for all you've
[SPEAKER_04]: done for the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a real reader.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of real readers in this
whole building and you're the one I look
[SPEAKER_04]: up to the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for the respect you were
showing in the book for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've done some amazing work over the
years and you're very humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these readers, they've got
this ego, but you know, the real deal.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bell is centered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Oscar from Greenhouse and
Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also took photos in my book,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the most iconic photos in the book
were taken by this guy right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my brother, I'm really happy you
think they are good enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, your picture is the next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you and I, what you see stuff is
so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so blessed to be able to work with
people like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one more, huh?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_15]: James, what was it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Four months ago, we were sitting on our
couch in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a good interview.
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you had just came out with the books.
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally, they're out.
[SPEAKER_15]: I told you it was coming out.
[SPEAKER_15]: You were listening to me.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're bringing it here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ten of us breathing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been waiting for it for four years,
I think.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was I saw you were coming out with a
book on it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to get that book of James.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no way I'm not going to get that
book.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so it's great to see you.
[SPEAKER_15]: How's everything going?
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've sold out of books pretty much for
the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have like, dude, it's loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow we have more books coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little surreal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, the whole spin of this adventure
has been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won best podcast of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: The International Cannabis Awards.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, congrats, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really love your podcast.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really great show.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the whole set up.
[SPEAKER_15]: You put so much passion in it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Really great show.
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a team effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have so many people that help us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My producer's in town, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the book signing,
all this stuff is just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The spin of us this year is the 20 year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's hyped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's coughed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's here to buy seeds and have a
good time.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's full blowing.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is some fire here, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is some fire here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I really, really tried some stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you got some loud stuff on you as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: We always have something loud.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you also came up with a bunch of
new crosses, Art.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did some fast blood crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to do a whole 30 minutes on the
fast blood crosses.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Schedule something on Skype or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Record that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Put it out to the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're busy as hell during this grand
abyss.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will tell you more about our brand
new cross, the one which I finished in
[SPEAKER_15]: less than eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the first time ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is nuts.
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fastest buds.
[SPEAKER_15]: The fastest buds and loud too.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for everything.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: And always remember, man, it's full 20
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're representing hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big ups, James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: James Loud genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: James Loud publishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Motherfucking James Loud everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big respect, my brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you back in Cali.
[SPEAKER_06]: Barcelona 2024.
[SPEAKER_06]: Represent DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: James has created a podcast that resonates
deeply with audiences around the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: James Loud has set the standard for
excellence in cannabis podcasting.
[SPEAKER_08]: His passion for sharing knowledge and
promoting positive change within the.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're honored to recognize James Loud's
outstanding contributions to the
[SPEAKER_08]: podcasting space with this prestigious
award.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for the work.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the producer for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also does the editing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast is so much bigger than one
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may get a lot of credit for it,
but it's so many people.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the effort of Ben, we have Brandon who
does the trips.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Eric who contributes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our wives who've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oral history of cannabis in the formal
podcast is so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 or 100 years from now, people can look
back at this revelation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The revolutionaries that we're
interviewing get their stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel so blessed to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Nuna Steller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on the win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited and I'm so grateful for
being part of the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we're trying to push
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the revolutionaries of the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I interviewed Steve D'Angelo and we were
talking about revolutionaries and I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: realize that that's what I want to do my
whole life was be a revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like you're in that same boat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was born with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming from social justice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything has a lens of how can this be
better, more equitable and add to a more
[SPEAKER_09]: beautiful world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't just have to be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be outside and even psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much healing that needs to
happen internally and externally with our
[SPEAKER_09]: earth and with our planet, with our bodies
that plant medicine has so many different
[SPEAKER_09]: realms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you can be a revolutionary and have
revolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we need more women in the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think there are a lot of women,
but we need more.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not many in ownership or decision
making positions.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we find is that there's when
you see the statistics of women in the
[SPEAKER_09]: industry, a lot of times they're in junior
positions, their labor base, but they're
[SPEAKER_09]: not really influencing change and really
adding their brilliance and knowledge to
[SPEAKER_09]: the pool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, this thing's been
cultivated by women and indigenous people
[SPEAKER_09]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't always a colonialistic kind of
like Western world thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It grows in every single latitude,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a lot of women that don't
get credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I get a lot of the credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's behind the scenes and there's a lot
of women behind the scenes that don't get
[SPEAKER_04]: credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some women don't really even need the
acknowledgement or like the prestige,
[SPEAKER_09]: but even just equal pay.
[SPEAKER_09]: The facts that we do the same jobs as men
and we got different titles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things like that, where it's like even the
women were like, I don't even need the
[SPEAKER_09]: kudos.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like don't pay me 60 cents on the
dollar and let me actually sit in on a
[SPEAKER_09]: board meeting and give my ideas.
[SPEAKER_09]: For some people, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's just, it's, it's about
respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect is so important for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just goes without saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to welcome more women in and
make sure, you know, it's like come in.
[SPEAKER_09]: The water's fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can succeed here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be safe, especially here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with this plant, the plant is so
special and it just means so much to all
[SPEAKER_04]: the people in this room, all the people
that have got to bring us to the point
[SPEAKER_04]: where we're at in our lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just collective effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen another industry where
people rely on and support and uplift each
[SPEAKER_09]: other, even in a competitor sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of ego, but at the
same time, it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like healthy compensation.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one wants to see anyone do poorly.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might get a little jealous if they're
doing well, but you'll still go to their
[SPEAKER_09]: events.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll still support them if they need it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: The clubs here in Barcelona, when one gets
rated, the other ones go and support them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we know that we need each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to lift each other up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the beauty of the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a huge market.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not fighting over a market share,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we're only growing more cannabis
curious and tenders of use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't just argue over it, especially
now that there's free, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: in a lot of senses, there's the seed and
the hemp and the things you can do online.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's direct to consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even need to funnel it through
some of these regulatory frameworks.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can just talk directly to your
customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would love to get you on a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, congratulations again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, shout out to the International
Cannabis Awards and for iSpire for having
[SPEAKER_09]: me out here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Feels good to win in Spain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we get, James?
[SPEAKER_11]: Show the hardware.
[SPEAKER_11]: Podcast award.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was honorable mention.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just gave them to everybody that
showed up, actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: Best podcast of 2024.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to gift you a special copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the King copy for the King of
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really thank you so much from the bottom
of my heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your contributions to this book were
immeasurable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your advice over the years, your
friendship, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate everything from you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, from the day we met,
man, you've always given me good advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've always told me the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've always been a straight student.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not stuff I always want to hear,
but the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: To finish, you should not lie.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to say I'm very proud of you
that you made this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's going to be a little new Bible
for all of us.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is coming from a breeder, which is not
a book writer, which is great.
[SPEAKER_14]: So probably one of the first books on the
market written by a real grower,
[SPEAKER_14]: which is for me, really, really important
that we could have help in the book.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just an honor for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, very happy, very proud of you.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you had a rough time the last five
years, but we are here now.
[SPEAKER_14]: Look how amazing this is.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to make new collabs so you
come out with this book so you can be
[SPEAKER_14]: super proud of yourself.
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: On behalf of the Greenhouse Fermi,
and I hope you sign it for us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're writing a King copy right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not even getting a number copy,
you're getting the King copy, but one of
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to let us get full gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Steve, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this book is for Franco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is it, Franco?
[SPEAKER_04]: eBay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: King copy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop debating.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here with Marcus, Dr. Green.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's from Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a big shout out to my friends and
family in Trinidad, St. Vincent and all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the Caribbean, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So glad to be hanging out with you here at
Spandermist.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been friends for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: James actually gave me my first dab back
in, what, 2011, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: 2011, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I took it like a man, a strong one,
you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Game changer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabs back then, we had odd dabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were all game changers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you gave me my first real hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried hot sauce many times, but not like
your hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your hot sauce is nuclear.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Trinidad has the real marugascopian
peppers, and then, of course, we use that
[SPEAKER_10]: secret ingredient, that sauteed curry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what have you been doing for
Spandermist?
[SPEAKER_10]: Spandermist this year, I have a lot of
friends with boots, of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of my friends are out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, and as you've just said with
the hot sauce, I bring hot sauce to my
[SPEAKER_10]: friends out here.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not easy walking with three gallons
of hot sauce all the way from Trinidad and
[SPEAKER_10]: then making a hundred little jars for all
the friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's still never enough, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this year, it's just been a little
more relaxing.
[SPEAKER_10]: No hot sauce this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had a little event in Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trinidad had it back in December,
Conference, Expo, and Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: It went off really smoothly, really well,
having another one in July, August.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this year, I brought some, as I brought
you a little ruling tree and handed it out
[SPEAKER_10]: to all the friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is seeing everybody, rekindling all the
vibes and making sure everybody's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the best thing you spoke?
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, Californians like yourself,
you know, you guys always have the best
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: How about here at Spandermist?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the best thing you spoke the first
day?
[SPEAKER_10]: From Spade.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the best thing you spoke?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I got to see grounded genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: My guy, I can't say his name, but my guy
grounded genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I took some stuff from him yesterday,
just to sample his flower and so on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I swear I was in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brought you back to the States.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, you know, it has been elevated for
the last few years.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, everywhere you see better
streams at the different clubs and so
[SPEAKER_10]: forth, different cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_10]: But my guy had some special stuff for me,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think his stuff overall was for some
of the best I spoke, some great skittles
[SPEAKER_10]: and stream hunters.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've tried skittles over the years
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this year, they had a duck amongst
about three or four other streams that I
[SPEAKER_10]: really like from them.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that one really, really, really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so and prices are much lower
this year in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: On everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: On everything than they were a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely a place to visit,
you know, for those who have yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you feel about the energy in this
year?
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I thought yesterday would be,
you know, way more crowded than than it
[SPEAKER_10]: was in a few years before.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was just we still got a little
space to move.
[SPEAKER_10]: And today, at least it's a little more
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Friday was nuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Friday was, I think, this year the most
busiest, which is not the regular for
[SPEAKER_10]: spotters.
[SPEAKER_10]: And usually it's Saturday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Friday was I mean, most of my friends
give out all their sample stuff and stuff
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on on Friday.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Friday was definitely busy this year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: But everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, doing what they do at
FANABAS, as usual, they take things to the
[SPEAKER_10]: highest level in terms of exposition and
what they're showing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you look around the greenhouse,
you'll see, you know, everybody goes all
[SPEAKER_10]: out, you know, and that's something you
can really appreciate about FANABAS as an
[SPEAKER_10]: expert is the one of the largest in
Europe, one of the largest in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So definitely somewhere that we need to be
and everybody who is within the industry
[SPEAKER_10]: should at least visit once.
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for taking your time to
speak with me.
[SPEAKER_10]: And man, I can't wait to hang out with
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just before you go, your book,
you know, I've been wondering about your
[SPEAKER_10]: book.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that you I saw on your post on
social media, all that you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to congratulate you on all
the years that you've taken to compile
[SPEAKER_10]: this, all the work you've put in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see you've made a dedication to Franco
from Strait Hunters, which is just
[SPEAKER_10]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We both know that he was one that had
real, real passion for the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that for for both of us,
you know, he was kind of a mentor role
[SPEAKER_10]: model, different aspects.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're blessed to be friends with him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so for all those who haven't
gotten it yet, I definitely suggest that
[SPEAKER_10]: you get a copy of this book, Cannabis
Breeding.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will have some of the best information,
some of the best of every part of the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, James has been so well around
the place, you know, and knows everybody
[SPEAKER_10]: within the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is definitely one thing to get your
hands on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Recommended by me also.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Stabilized everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, brother, it's so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Nils from Sticky Buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a special autograph just to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Passion for the sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Mr. Greenhouse from Argentina,
repping the brand, killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing their thing in Argentina
next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's sit up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a little bit of everybody here in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got Mr. Bubble Man from B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble Man in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20th, 20th spandibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20th spandibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 2004.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the 28th.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been to all of them except for the
one that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years in a row, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on the year
compared to the last couple?
[SPEAKER_04]: Since literally 2004, the hash and the
lozen has gotten better and better since
[SPEAKER_04]: every year that I've come here,
which is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: The local stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are so fucking passionate about
everything, about the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: The flower is a lot better here,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, the flower grown here is
really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, it's just like the
states, so it's good to be out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have good soil bile here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't killed it like we have in North
America, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bile is like it's in good shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's living.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why all of the ingredients and
food in the Mediterranean are exceptional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomatoes and basil and all of these
different vegetables and fruits express
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves so much nicer than they do in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find the resin not to be too
different, especially when I meet outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just like super choice,
super on point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so much variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's so much variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Spain, you get the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a lot of European stuff that we
don't see in the States.
[SPEAKER_04]: You still get a good amount of haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I got to ship this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Jack Reza.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, how rad, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ma, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love turquoise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely not for like two in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: One in the morning, two in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Scott from Rare and Angus came
by one time and we were in Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_04]: he brought like ghost train A's.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like midnight or 11 when he showed
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen him since 4.30 in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it keeps you going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like a bunch of tweakers or
something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, so how many times have you been to
Europe?
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, first time, first trip across
the big fog.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, first trip to Europe, first trip to
Barcelona, first spandibus.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of firsts this week.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because I feel like spandibus
can ruin Europe for stunners.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and I'm glad it's my first stop and
I'll make many returns.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully it's just the beginning of a
long tradition.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what have you been doing this week?
[SPEAKER_13]: This week, man, we did ICBC.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were staying in the Gothic district,
so there's so much to see.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been to a few of the clubs and tried
to keep up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually judged the Autoflower Cup.
[SPEAKER_13]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I was pleasantly surprised.
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest, I didn't have pretty high
hopes, but man, they brought us a nice
[SPEAKER_13]: stop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the best thing you smoked in
Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_13]: The best thing I smoked in Barcelona was a
hash roll somebody brought from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in the cup.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I've been wanting one of these.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the show, bro.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is some local.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure this will be the best I smoked in
Barcelona now.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great to see you.
[SPEAKER_16]: What's good, family?
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Nick Cote over here at spandibus.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're watching the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's happening, cadet community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sergio Picasso here out in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got spandibus Barcelona 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here at Terps Army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations to the James Loud podcast,
podcast of the year last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proud of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got legends in the house, chilling,
chopping it up, talking game, leveling
[SPEAKER_00]: each other up with some very interesting
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stoked to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having us,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check.
[SPEAKER_07]: Microphone check.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yo, we're in spandibus.
[SPEAKER_07]: James Loud show at the greenhouse booth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're all just chilling.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Aladdin.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's a contributor to this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: This book wouldn't be what it was without
people like Aladdin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, I think, over 22 contributors to
this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: The STS recipe is from this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it doesn't work, right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I love your social media presence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you're very educational and
you're very serious about it, but you have
[SPEAKER_03]: fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, likewise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But your podcast, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've got a lot of great
players and you ask a lot of very relevant
[SPEAKER_03]: questions on it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to talk to you about this
book, and I wanted to ask you a few
[SPEAKER_03]: questions about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what made you want to write it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you told me, well, we had a little
conversation before, and you were telling
[SPEAKER_03]: me that you wrote a book before,
but you didn't publish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote five times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote drafts of this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We even pre-sold copies on Amazon in 2019,
but the first round editing by an editor,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't his fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was learning how to write for one thing,
and these things kind of happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what makes things great is when
you fail, you get back up and do it over
[SPEAKER_04]: and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to do something bad enough,
you can do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so convinced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with cannabis, it'll guide you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant will guide you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen, the plant will tell you
what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I've done that my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been through a lot of failures,
and I feel like that's what's made me
[SPEAKER_04]: stronger and better than I was before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't take it too personal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you make mistakes,
you just get up, you do it again,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you do it the right way, and you turn
around to repeat the same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But breathing, I love breathing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You love breathing, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so great to be able to talk with
other people about genetics and about the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant and how it benefits their life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so many benefits to this
plant, and we're just scratching the
[SPEAKER_04]: surface of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the scientists don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just know a little bit about it
for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still learning a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long have you been writing this
book for, if you take everything into
[SPEAKER_03]: account?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've wrote probably hundreds of
thousands of words to get 100,000 words of
[SPEAKER_04]: this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the first version was, I think,
30,000 words, and this is 100,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and we got really high-end photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I were to release that first book,
I would have really been disappointed with
[SPEAKER_04]: myself the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is something that I feel this
does the subject justice, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's evolving so fast that I feel
like, even though I wrote this book and I
[SPEAKER_04]: try to stay current, there's some stuff
like double haploid breathing,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I'm talking about it in the past,
not in the past, but in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually something that's being
done right now by a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's already, information is becoming
obsolete.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have to update it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, every two years I'm going to update
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think at least right now until it's
more stable, because we're learning so
[SPEAKER_04]: much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to share it with the home
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the home growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best people are the biggest fans of
us, and the biggest supporters are the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that grow the plants in their
houses, in their backyard, the guys that
[SPEAKER_04]: have a few plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are real fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who is this book for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Home growers?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to learn about breeding,
it's an in-depth dive into what breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's case studies on different
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make feminized seeds,
it's all in the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I had to get so many different
places for the information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted it to be accessible to anybody
that wants to learn how to breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Angela helped me put it together
and make it really easy for people to
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was very easy to work with her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the back, there's like a
glossary, but you can go, there's QR
[SPEAKER_04]: codes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can go through the QR codes in the
book.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the glossary terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, if you want to learn how to
pronounce these glossary terms,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a section.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to the website and it has me
pronouncing the words.
[SPEAKER_04]: So going into the industry without as a
scientific background as some other
[SPEAKER_04]: people, pronouncing words can be
difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nice to have somebody that can
tell you the semity and not just somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why write a breeding blog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's already a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana bought me, but it's old.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very old.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from 1980.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's a Greg Green wrote a book 25
years ago, The Kitabas Reader's Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like those are outdated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good books for their time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you were saying before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for her time, they were great books.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have so much respect for both Greg
Green and Rob Clark for writing about
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I feel like we leave a modern update of
the breeding world and kind of what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of misinformation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can get rid of the
misinformation, cut through all the
[SPEAKER_04]: bullshit and put it all in one place,
people are going to benefit and it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's much easier to read than
marijuana and botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana and botany was like a little
tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some parts of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like, it's an easy read.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've read the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I haven't read the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read maybe about half of it because I
was, you know, contributing to it a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I had to write it, but read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I think I love it because you
didn't just talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about land races as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you talked about like many other
aspects of like cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it all like comes together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk about the seeds, the seed quality
and the different strains, cultivars and
[SPEAKER_03]: the land races and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The proper terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then I have people like you
reading the book and reviewing it and
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping it real, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got that from Reggie Gaudino.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it from a couple of them,
but I'll be rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they were like, do you really
mean this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're saying this or do you mean
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what really makes them for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, now these guys will help
me make my book better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how many people did you collaborate
with?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we talk about everybody,
there's over 22 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we had an editor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had someone to do the layout.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had two graphics people, two
photographers, you know, and then Dale
[SPEAKER_04]: Hunt did a contributing chapter on
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Matt Schneider did a tissue culture
chapter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just so many people that
contribute a bunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Lance.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's from Grove Bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually from Grove Bags helped me write
the section that's about drowning and
[SPEAKER_04]: curing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a lot of really detailed
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a group effort and it's a
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I love being part of things that are
so much bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like, you know, and I feel like
that's why we're here is to be part of a
[SPEAKER_04]: machine, part of things that to improve
the world and do better things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like 10 years ago, everything
was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like autoflowers, for example,
they were not nearly as good as they are
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many things that we haven't
been able to improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long have you been out to Brede?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in breeding for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was messing around in the early 2000s,
but I got serious in the late 2000s,
[SPEAKER_04]: like eight, nine, ten.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we won our first cup in 2012,
but I was breeding more for I wanted my
[SPEAKER_04]: own version of this or my own version of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I have a lot of different goals,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a lot of white labeling for other
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a bunch of genetics for a handful
of big companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like the quality of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like the quality and the consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like when you can have
consistent results.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what counts with breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like it's super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of that, what do you think about
Paul and Saki or just stabilizing lives
[SPEAKER_03]: and breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we both have our own place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't I think there's a lot of egos
involved with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people should be worrying about what
they're doing and not as much about what
[SPEAKER_04]: other people are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you're transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you're transparent.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have intersex traits, you should
tell people you have intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's hermaphrodites, you should tell
people that's so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's a bunch of diversity,
that's a big thing, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people want stabilized and other
people want the new life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a F1.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're both good things for the white
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just like you like banana and I
like chocolate jerks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But banana and Saki are a fine work well
together, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot for your time, Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great seeing you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go off to get some food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're here with Lance from I used to
say Lance from Boveda, but it's Lance from
[SPEAKER_04]: Grove now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Lance from Grove now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Lance from Boveda.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, so many people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've gotten around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Weedmaps, Boveda, Greenrose, Green Grove,
Grove Bags.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where am I now?
[SPEAKER_12]: Grove Bags up.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's Man of the Street doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do good.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, you know, you and I have done it
several times now.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the 20th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, the more things change,
the more you stay the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one thing a lot of the OGs are
like, wow, it's like it's like Groundhog
[SPEAKER_12]: Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Every year we come and it's very similar
to what it was the year before.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's definitely good, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of energy, a lot of people from
Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about you guys, but a lot of
the Germans, Austrians, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_12]: coming down from up north, obviously,
and close to adult use legalization up
[SPEAKER_12]: there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking forward to Mary Jane in a few
months, because that is in Berlin,
[SPEAKER_12]: in West Berlin.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for that to happen after legalization
up there, which I think is inevitable,
[SPEAKER_12]: is going to be dope, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, killer show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best turnout in years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love seeing my friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of friends came out.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of friends, and you and I both,
man, we were just talking about a friend
[SPEAKER_12]: from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of friends from around the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Rides from Australia, Thailand,
Argentina, Fergway, all across Europe in
[SPEAKER_12]: the North America side of things.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is one place we get to see old
friends who we only see maybe once a year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, dude, I look forward to getting you
on another podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do too, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ground Emerald Cup, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, have a good show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here today on the last day of
Spantimus with my good friend Barry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've known each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's True Kana Bliss online.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has the True KanaCast podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been crushing it for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grows the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: He smokes the fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: We smoke so much fucking weed in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember every time.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's making a hand stand up on my arm,
because we do have so many of my greatest
[SPEAKER_16]: memories.
[SPEAKER_16]: How's the show been?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always busy, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's never a dull moment in your life,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't eat jades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Late night since.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six in the morning underground vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely follow me next year,
because this shit's lit.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then how's your menopause been?
[SPEAKER_16]: Spantimus has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I live in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_16]: So for me, this is like the build up for
the whole year is for this.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is when I get to see all my friends
from the industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: I get to talk about my genetics.
[SPEAKER_16]: I get to show everyone what I've been
doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just the most fun I ever have.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I love Spantimus.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so nice to see what everyone is
loving.
[SPEAKER_16]: New innovations, new flavors, new
directions people are going in.
[SPEAKER_16]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Friends like yourself, I'm always watching
and inspired by.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's beautiful when I can get everyone
over and have those conversations and get
[SPEAKER_16]: a real insight.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I like to learn from you guys in any
way that I can.
[SPEAKER_16]: So for me, this is a big time to catch up.
[SPEAKER_16]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: Learn from you guys' mistakes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Find out what's hot, what's not,
what to avoid.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lord knows we make a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you can't help each other as
friends and try to learn from each other's
[SPEAKER_16]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Lift each other up.
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_16]: So for me, it always gives me such a boost
to the way I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_16]: I love that everyone shows to have
everything appreciated.
[SPEAKER_16]: Every person you see with genetics and
tell them about stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously, tell us about your new
genetics.
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the things I'm really excited about is
I've just released the strain called
[SPEAKER_16]: Filipina Queen, which is a Filipino land
race across my strain, Kem Valley Cooks,
[SPEAKER_16]: which I previously won.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was third place Spantimus.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Kem Valley Cooks is forum cookies
across San Fernando Valley OG,
[SPEAKER_16]: across Kem.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've hit that to the Filipino land
race.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the Filipino land race, I dubbed her
lovesick.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you cut her, she bleeds red.
[SPEAKER_16]: She's so rich in anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_16]: That she bleeds red.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what I'm finding is that she adds so
much vigor to the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_16]: I flowed until outdoors, until November in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_16]: Completely resistant to powdery mildew.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Turps that are just almost indescribable.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know when you can't pluck a comparison
out of the sky.
[SPEAKER_16]: And anyone that smells it is like they're
confused.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're looking for others, but they can't
pinpoint what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, that's the Filipina Queen I'm
super excited about.
[SPEAKER_16]: And our intro released with Kem Valley
Cooks F2s to coincide with that drop.
[SPEAKER_16]: So those two I'm super excited about at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome seeing you again, bro.
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, for sure.
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to do a collab podcast together.
[SPEAKER_16]: 100% with 100%, bro.
[SPEAKER_16]: And genetics wise as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, let's do some collabs.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd love to do something cool with you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we got similar taste buds,
but differences as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: So sure, I think we could combine some
interesting ideas.
[SPEAKER_16]: For our pleasure as always.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing seeing you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, wicked seeing you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, I'm here at Spirit Abyss the last
day with Neela.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends, my idols, my
inspirations.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's written an amazing book as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's done so many things that have
had positive impact on our community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to give you this book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give you a look back.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the span of his day?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exhausted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exhausted, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a dab with him and you've been
going to events every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not every night.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: This bed is quite popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the final.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, tell us about the final event that
you're going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to what club is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they always ask me, where are you
going tonight?
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, oh, I have a very small private
club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I say, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the energy here is like 10
years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, and you haven't aged in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you keep getting younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it is, I need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe more smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I eat brown rice, brown bread and
brown sugar, organic vegetables and
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed when I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I cycle a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you cycle a lot, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, you guys, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a flat country.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a flat country.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to worry about other bikers a
little bit, but other than that,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I've been hit by a biker before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for our amazing contributions to
our industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steele 101.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the special number 101.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Gary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here today with T.H.
[SPEAKER_04]: Caesar.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've known each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got through some shit together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you grow up in this industry,
you know, from being young.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, it's been an amazing journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've known each other for probably,
like, at least a decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than 14 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you doing here as Favis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you do the seed then?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now I'm just backpack teching.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my first year in Spatibus with my
seed brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I missed out on last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this year I'm out here just promoting
my brand slowly, trying to get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: my genetics in a bunch of people's gardens
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you started out as a writer for High
Times, loving weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously you still love weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's where you got your start was
with High Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you kind of you did the seed
brokering thing for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Hussle, you were the guy to go to for
rare and elite genetics more than anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you started doing breeding,
which you're doing now and hustling and
[SPEAKER_05]: hustling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're in New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back in New York full time now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's culture shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely something that I didn't
think was going to happen like the way it
[SPEAKER_05]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to take advantage of
whatever's happening right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: because if it's not me, it's going to be
somebody else making that money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I might as well be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a nice time to be back in New
York with a bunch of pop ups.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis being sold pretty much
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prerose can be sold pretty well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not can be sold, but they are sold
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ain't sold ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people can literally set up a table
like this in the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: So weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Copting won't bust you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost a free fall in New York right
now when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like you're
synonymous with New York and you're back
[SPEAKER_04]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: You belong there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do your thing in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: But New York is really where you're going
to thrive.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was home.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Colorado to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a back in 2012 when they voted
it in Colorado and Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Colorado to learn as much as I
could.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that I built up my resume and
knowledge, I'm trying to take all that
[SPEAKER_05]: back to New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, dude, thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Dario Roscoe, the King of
Spanneris.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: King of Spanneris.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, it's been a great show, dude.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen, it's always great to have friends
on the show and get her up and mingle,
[SPEAKER_14]: mingle and create new collabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Barcelona is one of the best shows in
the world, besides the one in Buenos
[SPEAKER_14]: Aires, I think.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is nuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is nuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we probably have 50, 60,
70 thousand people here again.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy on Friday, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like the energy is also back.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of good things happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, that was just awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, your booth is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys always get new booths,
big improvements.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole Thailand history there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are doing big things in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that going?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going great.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are now finalizing your GMP facility.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've got 52 glass houses and poly
houses.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a Thai indoor.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we're doing a GMP.
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we finish in August and at the
same time in the North, we are finishing
[SPEAKER_14]: the seed factory, which will have around
35 breeding rooms.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the bigger badges of the greenhouse
seed company now is that besides the big
[SPEAKER_14]: seed factory, where we can produce like
tons of seeds, we can also try out all our
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff indoor, poly house, glass house and
outdoor, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's great to see genetics growing
everywhere, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can even try it under LED, under HPS,
optimize every grain specific,
[SPEAKER_14]: optimize everything perfectly.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to come see you.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: When are you coming?
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: The best time to come because the glass
houses are empty now because we grow
[SPEAKER_14]: between October and March.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that gets really odd.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't want to grow in a really,
really odd season, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we pregrow our plants again a few
months.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when they're ready in September,
we put them in again, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you get two harvest a year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we do two harvest a year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then when we cut down, we make new ones
and we build up the old base in the North.
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can see, there's 19 glass houses.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we go to the 32 poly houses
starting September.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll pregrow 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then November is the first harvest.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's another harvest in
January, February.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how we rotate.
[SPEAKER_14]: When you are fully integrated in Thailand,
you have the coffee shop model.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got the grow.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically, as you guys call it,
from seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we prefer to say from farm to table.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a proper restaurant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Literally farm to table.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're getting fresh flour.
[SPEAKER_14]: The freshest of the fresh flour right from
the people that grow it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no middle man between anymore who
can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's us growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's us drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's us transporting it to the shops.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's in our shops in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hope to see you guys in one of our
three shops in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one in Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one in Sukhumvit.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one in Wantan Road.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we're opening next month in
Japantown in Tohlor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then in two months, we're opening in
Kusumui on the island.
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, we have five this year.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe a few more.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, looking forward to all that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see what we can do, bro.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to get you on the podcast in
the States.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_14]: And guys, keep watching James Loud
podcast, one of the best podcasts in the
[SPEAKER_14]: world.
[SPEAKER_14]: Great friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rock and roll, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm here today with Mahmood from Dutch
Passive, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, too, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just finished my breeding bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: You released it just recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys contributed some amazing
photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for all your help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're happy to see the booth finished.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a group effort from so many
people to make this book what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's really special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mutations and all that other stuff
you guys contribute is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to contribute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks so much for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to sign an autograph that's with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fashion for the sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, man.
Thank you.
