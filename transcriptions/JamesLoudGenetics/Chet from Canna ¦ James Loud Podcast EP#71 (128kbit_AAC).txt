[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, our special guest is Chet from
Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing today, Chet?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about this for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Chet's in town for Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're both going to be at this amazing
event that's been going on forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the 20-year anniversary, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the way they promote the culture
is so exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the first time in Oakland
we're going hip-hop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It went from Grateful Dead to Too Short.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went from Grateful Dead to Too Short in
a short matter of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to see what they do with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Oakland, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Been working in Oakland my whole life on
and off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking earlier about how you had
to grow right down the street from where I
[SPEAKER_05]: had to grow when I was in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those big basements.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is a while back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a 50-lighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost 50 lights in a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 12 in the supposed to be the second
living room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I camouflaged it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone was like, this seems larger
from the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were pulling so much power.
[SPEAKER_05]: The line was buzzing coming in the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one ever complained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hate to admit it, but there was
also a time when you could get PG&E to
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize you as a low-income person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you didn't have a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just qualified as low income.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would subsidize the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, don't they see that I have a
$1,200 power bill and they're subsidizing
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So around 2014, they started giving breaks
for people that bought electric cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so literally that year, all of my
friends bought electric cars.
[SPEAKER_05]: They bought Nissan Leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, you got 50% off of your power
bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you didn't use the plug?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just rewired that plug?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of my friends, he bought three
of them for three different houses and put
[SPEAKER_05]: them in different people's names.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the power bill and their names
and was using that to save money.
[SPEAKER_05]: But no names.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want PG&E coming trying to get
their money back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they seem to take advantage of
the customer these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the power bills are a lot higher
than they used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's gone up the groceries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another podcast though,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that hasn't gone up is our
favorite commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I think the price on the streets
is the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: The price in dispensaries is the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: The growers are making a heck of a lot
less.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the inputs have gone up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The inputs like electric.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, if we're looking at
electricity and then we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Warehouse, if you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Warehouse, if you own Kana or you own
whatever it is, you're paying more.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're paying more to keep the lights on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're paying more to pay your employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're paying more for those ingredients,
whatever you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every input.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, with the way the
state treats it, like the best analogy,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were talking about my friend who runs a
high fidelity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out Chris Garcia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically it's like, they'll charge
you for the bologna, the lettuce,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bread, the cheese, and then they tax
the sandwich as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, so every aspect,
the bread maker gets taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bakery gets taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheese maker gets taxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the sandwich maker
gets taxed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my favorite saying is Uncle Sam is
your silent partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't own your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just renting it from them with
their property taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope sooner or later that it becomes
some more, not considered like cigarettes
[SPEAKER_01]: or alcohol, but more like cinnamon or
turmeric.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we're just starting to
normalize it right now as something that,
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as it's probably safer than alcohol
or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think for the longest time,
it was like, oh, man, the devil's lettuce
[SPEAKER_05]: is bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we all know the story of DuPont and
hers, the paper and plastic people who
[SPEAKER_01]: demonized it with reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch Reefer Mavis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an awesome comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll blow your mind, especially if you
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're like, wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did they get there?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is going on here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mind blowing how we went from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it took us so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, alcohol prohibition was very short
in relative to how cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_05]: has taken so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was generations of people that
believed that it was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, your mom's generic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not your mom, but my mom's always like,
so what about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, here's a salve for
your arthritis or whatever.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: My parents are on board with the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you remember when they didn't know
what you did for a living?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people had that luxury of
having those parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my parents the whole time were like,
so what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the gardening industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even with this job and even though the
name, you're like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you grow up in this area?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I was somewhat of a military
boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I settled down and my
grandparents owned a ranch in Malibu.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lived there for a long time while my
parents still traveled and then went back
[SPEAKER_01]: and forth between there and D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then senior year of high school,
I went to Palisades High School in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I started really getting into,
you know, by buying the product on the
[SPEAKER_01]: streets and then like, I can make I can do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I need is space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to went to high school,
went to college in Texas, started there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a real hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: What part of Texas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin, Austin, San Marcos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a cool town.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to figure out in 92, 93 on how to
grow indoors without buying more air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning or growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it hits about one hundred ninety
something degrees, the plant goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not growing anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wasting your time and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I moved to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you you do two jobs to
rent the other bedroom in the flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as that that room pays
off, then you tell the other roommates
[SPEAKER_01]: they can go because you're going to rent
out their room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then no one but the
landlords.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not you know, you're not doing all
the other drugs that are in the streets of
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then you're a good landlord.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a good tenant, you know,
to the landlord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I grew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did acquire a small issue
living in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I did seem to party a little too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get to one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My kids might watch this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to, you know, go too deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell off off camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I had to get get my life in order
and move to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I just put my head down and I
was like, I'm not doing anything else for
[SPEAKER_05]: me.
[SPEAKER_05]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: is like I think of is the party city.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think San Francisco is more like you can
party anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I needed was no assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to get away from the people I
knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I moved to Pasadena and and got a
duplex and lived in the living room and
[SPEAKER_01]: then went to the landlord and said,
I need another duplex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, I had a couple of duplexes
and then I met a woman, got her pregnant
[SPEAKER_01]: and then she became my wife still to this
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to I had to I had to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, it's stressful being in
the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, the it's a lot different than it
is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like in California,
it's it's a misdemeanor now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back then, you know, back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you say you have hemp.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, it all falls under not all
of it, but a lot of it falls under THCA,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have the DCC and then we have,
you know, that's the big oversight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have hemp licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's funny because,
like, I mean, that that stuff is all as
[SPEAKER_05]: far as we're talking hemp license,
not for flour, not in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They they don't that one doesn't work
here, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in other states, Oregon, so Kentucky,
Tennessee, Tennessee and Texas are the two
[SPEAKER_01]: that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all CBD dispensaries,
but they're selling flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're selling flour that you can smoke
and it will make you feel different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to blow anybody's cover,
but the new game is is false COAs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, whoa, you guys are
fucking messing with federal state
[SPEAKER_01]: documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, but even still, I think if
you know what you're doing and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: growing the right cultivars and most of
them are the right cultivars, you can
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest early and it will show up as THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and if you're not heating it up,
you're not going to get Delta 9 THC if the
[SPEAKER_05]: product doesn't start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as you're not heating it up,
you're going to have a product that's
[SPEAKER_05]: THCA, maybe some CBD, some other
cannabinoids, but you're not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: have, you know, the bad one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you, you know, it's, we live in an
interesting time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the whole world, the whole United
States should be like that where you can
[SPEAKER_05]: go to any store and buy it as long as
you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I feel like, I mean,
I, I still believe in the whole adult
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, even though when I was a kid,
I got cigarettes when I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got other people to buy my cigarettes,
alcohol cigarettes, you know, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but I do think that, uh,
I think adult, you know, this is the,
[SPEAKER_01]: my libertarian point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if any too many, you know,
but I think adults should be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they don't hurt anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hurt yourself better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, but even still, I mean,
hurting yourself to a degree, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's some stuff I don't think meth
should be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, that, that, uh,
fortunately for us, the, uh, fentanyl,
[SPEAKER_01]: and other hard narcotics has so
overshadowed us that we can kind of get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little room to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So look at Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything was legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going back on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is, which is, you got to try it
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to figure out somebody has to try
it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we know if it's going to be good or
bad unless we try it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it worked in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So places like Portugal, it works,
you know, and I think, but it's not,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not a cookie cutter all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every situation is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the libertarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't like the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the state and local governments
going, no, I mean, if you live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Nebraska, you should be able to smoke
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you live in downtown New York,
you probably shouldn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just, it all depends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause each city, each town,
each state is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I think there's a lot of
things, you know, like that California
[SPEAKER_05]: could have done different and like every
state, every state we look at Oregon,
[SPEAKER_05]: they gave out too many licenses,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like Washington, Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they've had their own set of problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma is a nightmare, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're, you know, and I,
California did it pretty good,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we still have our own issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: The taxation is the worst part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've kind of gone over a hundred
percent now on the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's over a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but yeah, I mean, just for like,
if we, if we look at it, I think they just
[SPEAKER_05]: rolled back some of the taxes too in June,
June 1st, June 1st, June 5th, something
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think also 40% of the revenue going
to the police, to the law enforcement is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a mistake as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not for, I mean, not for enforcement
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're in a strange time,
but this is, this is the, it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: building a small business though.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to, there's a lot of trial and
error that goes on and stabilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be stable for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to, we're going to go through
this period of uncertainty for quite a
[SPEAKER_05]: while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's going to stabilize and we're
going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at the genetics are all over
the place right now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a lot of the stuff is the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't even understand what's
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: They think they have this, but really they
have this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of the, we were talking
about that earlier, the name game,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hustle.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it cut fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're like, oh yeah, here's the RS
11, but really it's lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to some of these, many of these LP
manufacturers and how they will,
[SPEAKER_01]: because metric will allow you to change
the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, if your wedding cake isn't
selling, all of a sudden you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: something completely different and it's
the same product and no one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no verification.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no verification.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the biggest thing is like,
how do you verify it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now my flora DNA out of Sacramento,
they're doing some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the fingerprinting technology that
we have now, we can identify stuff that's
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly the same, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like, there's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 something odd purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all just basically in my opinion,
from what I've seen in the last 35 years
[SPEAKER_01]: of recultivating, it's just some
granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you, you, you know more than me
about this, but, but you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see a lot of, I mean, you can breed
that trait into pretty much anything over
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Jimmy from Myers Creek talk about
how he brought it to the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, you know, I was actually
giving that, you know, props.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, it's, it's from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like GDP, but, but GDP.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, cookies came along and
gelato and sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, you know, it blew up and now
purple is a qualifier for good cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is so silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not, that's not, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people, people are, I can just give
you, I can just drop the temperatures and
[SPEAKER_01]: make the phosphorus deficient and boom,
there's your purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody else that wants to make a
purple strain out there, just get your
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temps to about 58 degrees and or lower and
boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, cause temperature is important as
pH for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't realize that, you know,
once you get your pH, but then if your
[SPEAKER_01]: temps are off, you know, too high,
it just won't even take anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically cooking it, you're
killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's too low, then it won't,
it won't interface with all the micro and
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients that are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have deficiencies, which then
depending on what time you harvest in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you know, Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get a little longer with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll get more purple too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just the same with golden goat,
you know, golden goat, the reason is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's 110 day strain and it's
basically turning gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, a lot of people are
like, Oh, I'm like, that's not golden
[SPEAKER_01]: goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, you didn't let it go long
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have 110 days in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, don't grow that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your LA, your LA confidential or your
crack, your green crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I really like LA confidential and
I like green crack.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, it's, it's got this unique nose
that's unmistakable and it's got this nice
[SPEAKER_05]: gas to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's not the gassiest thing in the
world, but it's got great gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got like the perfect amount of gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very well balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your, one of your, let's not,
I don't want to put you down, favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, a flower to ingest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people that watch the show,
they all know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, sorry.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will tell you that my favorite is
cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how long have you seen
cat?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long time since I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just saw sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I'm going to have some sour
diesel this week in an emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, dude, the real south, the real,
the real, real sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they still do like pre-98?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what they, what are they?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love pre-98 Bubba too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the soapiness of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the uniqueness of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I can spot that in a grow room
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's certain, there's certain things
that I've grown over my life where I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: like, just by looking at it, I'll tell you
that's Bubba Cush.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the, the bud structure,
the top, how the top grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with sour diesel when I've done
a bunch of sour in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with confidential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still see, I see confidential in my
head right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, cause it's so.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a little bit thicker hairs too.
[SPEAKER_05]: The confidential has these yarn hairs a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, not too, like the Durban that
I grew back in the day had years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The yarn where it covered up the crystals.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the LA confidential would,
they would start out as bigger hairs,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then the, the, the, uh, Brax would
start to swell up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the Brax swelled up, they would
make the hairs a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's one of my classics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to you about this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I'm, I'm really into the,
you know, I guess it's the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: older person in me, but, uh, train wreck,
the headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like so that's a, the headband is another
one that depending on who you ask,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get 10 different opinions on what
real headband is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some people like, uh, you know,
humble headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people like 707 headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I've seen both of those and
those are two totally different.
[SPEAKER_05]: LA headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these different headbands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I, yeah, I mean the 707 versus
there was an OG Kush headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the one that I liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that I got from, yeah, Noel was
the, this guy Noel, he's from,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, nectar's nectar's collective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was part of the Holy water crew
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Noel is the one that brought that headband
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, I see collective had it
and dude, that thing is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, 2013 cup loud seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was part of loud seeds and we won the
first place with IC collective with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that was the cut from Noel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you know, it's been fun to
see like, uh, you know, how, what four
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago cap and his Mac one was the
rage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny how that was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people still think of it and love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm, I'm not the hugest fan of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a breeding book and in my breeding
book, I, there's a case study on,
[SPEAKER_05]: on it because it's extremely special,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as genetically, it is extremely
unique, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's extremely special.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was an accident, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a partial trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they're an accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I think he intentionally bred
that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: He worked on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the, he did some real
selection on it too, because if you,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you work with any of the lineage,
uh, it comes out hazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the other, like we had a
Mac 69.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, but if you look at it,
so, so Mac 69 that I got for first-class
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics, who's one of my good friends,
my buddy Ray, he gave me this,
[SPEAKER_05]: this other Mac, which was the Mac 69.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was hazy, very hazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see how they were related.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could totally see how they were
related, but it was like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like totally missing the haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think the haze craze is going to
come back?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, I remember it's already back in
certain circles for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say the equatorial sativa,
whatever that, that category is definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: slowly making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's big over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some super silver in my bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's mind blowing that you'll be like,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait till the end of this podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's super silver lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have those, uh, you know, those green
greenhouse seed company, my good friend,
[SPEAKER_05]: Ariane.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's Dutch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's all kinds of stuff, but greenhouse
seed company is from over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, just speaking of them,
I was, uh, talking about Adam Dunn the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a character speaking of Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: We might as well just throw Adam's name in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, he was the one, you know,
one of the very first that said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to go over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, he heard what was
happening in Denver, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: four, 15 years ago and jump ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I can go back home now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that MK ultra that he did,
you know, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like MK ultra.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, those are nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's what I was back to my
point is that that's the kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, I really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about Romulan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked Romulan back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was Romulan, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Aren't they, aren't they a generation?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you say similar?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that, but that white, white widow,
there was different expressions of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We only had, we, we got this stuff called
the white widow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't anything like the European
white widow, but it would make you sweat
[SPEAKER_05]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it the sweat.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it from Richmond and these guys
grew it and it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 4,000 a pound or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Richmond here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Richmond here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys used to grow killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Richmond still the scary neighborhood?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's areas in Richmond that are still
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Romulan and white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your desert Island strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's shoreline.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now there's, this is another great
topic for discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I work with shoreline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the, I am one of the few.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Texas shoreline or the Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the devil, the what's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Devil's harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had the only got half of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so they, they bred that with someone's
lavender.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they bred it with someone's lavender.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe that the real shoreline,
I can get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bred with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say that that's from the skunk
family.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's skunk something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from a, it's from a bag at a 1980,
1988, 1989 dead show at the shoreline
[SPEAKER_01]: amphitheater.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys, my boys got a bag and they had
one seat in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started in their closet and
then another person, uh, Paul Hanson,
[SPEAKER_01]: God rest his soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he blew up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Houston, which is a huge consumer
market made it, uh, commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so, and then I got ahold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I knew, I knew those guys and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, shoreline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made some cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crosses with the shoreline.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, uh, we call one of them Bucky's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're from Texas, I love that
shoreline cut and it's strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got this unique nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did some work with the Fort Collins
cough too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another one that I really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a tall, you know, and I crossed
it with the banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Fort Collins cough has still got,
uh, you know, still got people making
[SPEAKER_01]: money off of it up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's hard to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of people want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big tall plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you grow it outdoors, it just wants to
grow straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one I had in my backyard was
11 feet tall or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you grown train wreck outdoors
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've only grown it indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: So train wreck is one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, a lot of my friends grew train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first moneymaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always looks funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It never, it never looks like the happiest
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think the Adam Dunn said basically
it was called train wreck because it turns
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow room into a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't surprise me at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, instead of like, there's no,
like, you know, a train hit something or
[SPEAKER_05]: some story hits you like a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's a, it's a day timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it work weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but it's strong too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I always thought it was called
train wreck because you feel like a train
[SPEAKER_01]: wreck, but you can tap bang out some
emails or some reports on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I think shoreline is,
uh, is my go to the older version.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, the problem too,
you can talk on this is the, the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shoreline, shoreline never had,
uh, not too many people put it back to
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're taking, you know, a cutting of a
cutting of a cutting and 20 something
[SPEAKER_05]: years later, it's different than you
remember it from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to ever acquire the first
couple cuts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause which don't exist because either
they've turned to the trash or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or mold or yeah, we have this
little thing called tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I was so excited about now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about that after the show,
but yeah, getting that through tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a lot of those things,
I think, you know, I was thinking sour
[SPEAKER_05]: diesel had a lot of that going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought, you know, these guys,
cause I've, I've seen sour diesel from 10,
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 different people over the last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were like, Oh, this is some sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have given me sour diesel
samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're looking for the sour and
they give it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it reminds me more of chem
91 than it does of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got that burnt tire, but it doesn't
have that like strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think what is the relationship
between chem dog and sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's a, it's a bag seed of chem
91.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can argue this cause everyone knows
they're different.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people watching the show will argue
this and I went and I tried to source as
[SPEAKER_05]: much information as I could as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there any relation to hell's angels
on either one of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's the story I heard hell's
angels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cross between that and some dead
heads, which back in the sixties was
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, maybe from the, you know,
I mean, there's the whole chem dog story
[SPEAKER_05]: and we don't need to go into that right
now, but that was another dead show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was, yeah, deer Creek.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was deer Creek, 1991.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have, yeah, it's, it's,
I have someone gifted me tickets from that
[SPEAKER_05]: show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got the tickets that are mounted in
frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the fish show this weekend on
the East coast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, Billy strings is playing
on Saturday and Sunday at the Greek this
[SPEAKER_05]: week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Billy strings.
[SPEAKER_05]: His music's amazing dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how did you get involved with Kana?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my grows in LA, uh, uh, 2002,
three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I got a woman pregnant,
wonderful wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and she's like, you need a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two duplexes going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're, we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, no, you need to get health
insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to get a reputable,
you need a paycheck to put in the bank so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can borrow money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to go work for better grow in
Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I worked for them doing the
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he was the first guy to do internet
text, like reviews and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're talking five and six,
2005 and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, I was working for him and my
grows and I started using Kana in 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I moved to LA, I was tired of,
uh, the general hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt that I was missing something,
uh, which I was, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, I had to make the next step up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the guy who worked at the store
that I finally worked at, uh, said,
[SPEAKER_01]: have you ever tried Kana?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, relatively new to
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it got here in 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been in Holland for 30 years,
as long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's pretty much, you know,
the staple of Europe that in, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it or not, bio biz are the two big
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kana has been around forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had Kana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, like I said, it's 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is as old as GH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I was using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course that changed, that changed
my, I became a better grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, uh, I moved to Texas,
back to Texas, uh, because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: afford to live in California with a wife
and a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I bought a, uh, some duplexes there
and I was about to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just told myself, it's not going to
work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started a trucking company,
you know, with all my, my, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: investments and, uh, then 2007 and eight
happened and the construction world died.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, I need to go back to
making money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bubble burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the market just crashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one was buying materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had so many friends that lost their
houses because of their, the loans,
[SPEAKER_05]: the mortgages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically that was the year where that was
also the, that was also when everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: went, to they had gotten the loan six
months to a year before and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustable rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first six months you're at it,
but then they jacked up the adjustable
[SPEAKER_05]: rates where you couldn't afford it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't afford the monthly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't refinance out of that loan,
then you just default.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but you got to live there for
eight months or a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, uh, that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold my trucks, parked one of my trucks,
sold one of my trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I bought a rental house,
uh, and or turned the rental house back
[SPEAKER_01]: into, uh, grow and then, uh, did that and
worked it back at a retail store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my old friend who worked for
Canna said, why don't you come work for
[SPEAKER_01]: us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2011, I started subcontracting,
you know, uh, contract work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2012, I got a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been with them for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, you know, I work for a Dutch
company, you know, so it's not a typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different, you know,
health insurance and yeah, there's less
[SPEAKER_05]: oversight with the company over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, yeah, I've been dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I think it's sort of like,
you know, we're talking about our friends
[SPEAKER_01]: at Royal gold working for a quality
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's half their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're telling you, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're just like, Oh, what do you
know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you feel like you're part of the family
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was, I sat my guys down today
and we had this conversation and I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, I hope it's always like this,
but I don't think it's as we grow,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we have a tight team and I have
the best guys working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally I have the best guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a tight team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's, you know, on board and
everybody's happy all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you get a big company together,
as you grow, it's not always like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second you have 20 employees,
it's different.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can try to make it,
it takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's just a different culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then once your priorities change and
everybody's like, well, let's make some
[SPEAKER_01]: more money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No longer is this just my passion,
but now I want it to be a financial
[SPEAKER_01]: productive endeavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to sort of start with the
handbooks and the protocol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the streamlining and you
know, we use SOPs for everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like we've tried to incorporate the
culture early on, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also I want my guys to feel
appreciated because I've worked for big
[SPEAKER_05]: corporations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked for small companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a business owner before and you
know, I, my parents were business owners.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to see firsthand, you know,
what it was like with 50 employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've worked for companies that had
thousands of employees that were for
[SPEAKER_05]: Charles Schwab back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I've done a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, I think it's great to
have employees that want to come to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're excited to come to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get treated well, they get respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the productivity and the product
quality and your ease of management is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is facilitated on how happy the employee
is to be there and how much they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: come back the next day.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they're a representation of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you train them correctly,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they're going to represent you in the
best way possible, exactly how you would
[SPEAKER_05]: want it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't, you know, and there's a
fine line where it's like, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: where you're over-managing or
micromanaging and that, that's bad,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's also, if you train them from the
beginning and you train them the right way
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're able to spend, I'm able to
spend a lot of time with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's the, uh,
professional, the, I read this about,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was Nick Saban or it
was another college coach, but real,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, maybe Mac Brown college coaches don't,
they don't pick place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't design.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have a system or whatever,
but most of them are just culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the culture of the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, they instill every day,
whatever aspect of a culture of a program
[SPEAKER_01]: they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's too true for positive
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have this, this culture,
and then you let the people you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've hired do the management and the
jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once in a while, you know, more than,
more than anything, you're just solving
[SPEAKER_01]: inter problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have systems in place,
the employees fall back on their systems
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's how they do their job is based
on the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, I have to do this,
this, this, and this, and this today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I have to do for this
week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, if you can help them with
the time management, like this is what's
[SPEAKER_05]: required.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we need done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times it's just reverse
engineering the problem or the solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it's all reverse engineering.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at the end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want this amazing clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we get an amazing clone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have these steps that it takes,
and then we have this window to sell them
[SPEAKER_05]: or we need amazing seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, we want the most beautiful
looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do we get the most beautiful seeds
and the most amazing seeds that are going
[SPEAKER_05]: to germinate for everybody that not only
look great, but they grow well,
[SPEAKER_05]: they have minimal intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these things, you know, and it goes
back into, you can dive back into the
[SPEAKER_05]: phenohunting aspect of it and testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you thoroughly testing stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and are you testing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also are you testing it before
you sell it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, that was a trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's changing that I saw about
three ammo cups ago was where these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, I was like, there's no way you
even, you even grew this pheno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where did, how do you get,
how are you selling these?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, people would just get stuff,
make seeds and then sell the seeds and not
[SPEAKER_05]: test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And never grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never grow that pheno.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make, you know, we make over 300
out-crosses a year and we release a very
[SPEAKER_05]: small portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're not all winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be all winners.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and we don't have, and even beyond
that, we don't have time to go through
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I do release stuff that has intersex
traits, it's because it's special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you pop a 10 pack of seeds,
you're going to find special stuff in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to let people know online.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look on the website and you go
to that specific cross, it'll say that
[SPEAKER_05]: this has potential for intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as you're just claiming it and
people are still really interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause a lot of people are like,
I gotta have this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta have a cross with this in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you know, slowly but surely
we'll move away from that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to do a clone sales as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exciting to be able to do clone
sales, I think, domestically and to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to get clones that you're on your
doorstep that are from tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_05]: that are, you know, certified,
clean, pest and packaging, authentic,
[SPEAKER_05]: verified.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do fingerprinting on everything that
we're going to be shipping out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, you'll be able to test,
well, you'll be able to see our test
[SPEAKER_05]: results.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be able to look at everything that
it's went through as a hoplite and Viroid
[SPEAKER_05]: clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's a really big topic right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, it's like, it's about
the first thing is awareness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to know, you need to be aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you transmit it?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it look?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the symptoms?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, cause there's also a lot of
symptoms that are not hoplite and that are
[SPEAKER_05]: other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to know a lot of signs of
different things, but also what are the
[SPEAKER_05]: signs of hoplite?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do I treat?
And what is it?
And they're all the same, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I just get rid of the plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I tissue culture it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that that important that I need to
clean it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's a lot of genetics out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really worth cleaning that thing or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you okay with losing 10 to 30% of
your yield, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and it varies because it can lay
dormant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden you have some
stress and you lose anywhere between one
[SPEAKER_05]: plant, a whole row.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half of your crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you just never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think people had the blind spot
folds on for a long time and didn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I've seen denial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen denial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, dude, you, you got hobbling
writers like, no, no, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're buying clones from other
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're bringing those in and are they
really testing for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you use, do your own clones and
you know, but like you've used clones from
[SPEAKER_05]: other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you're using the same drippers that
were in plants that were infected.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think is going to happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to infect your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's so many different ways to
get infected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use clean tools on everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even our tissue culture plants between
the plants, we still use clean tools with,
[SPEAKER_05]: with every plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll use on the same plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to have just peace of mind,
a case, a case of this instead of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, well, and it's like,
if one plant is infected, we can pull it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we don't get infected plants because
everything's from tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but we still take precautions.
[SPEAKER_05]: What if for some reason something,
you know, it tested negative and then all
[SPEAKER_05]: of a sudden it's positive because it's
that bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's honestly that bad to where you can
have a negative test and it's a false
[SPEAKER_05]: negative or the viral load is so low.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just hasn't had a chance to replicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I mean, we're talking about,
there's people that are treating it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's chemicals that you can
put on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think those are mostly band-aid
fixes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sound good in theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also need specific application,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can't, you know, our,
our industry has always had that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the super might, how we,
we, we Californians created the worst and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the laxatives equal half-ass
procedures that people used.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and it used to be like, we're just
going to spray this, this, and this on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the trifecta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the avid, the judo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't remember what the other one
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always forget, but a forbid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say forbid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was avid, judo and forbid back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, Oh, the trifecta,
you just rotate through.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, who sprays that stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody does that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you do, there's something wrong
with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I usually don't consume other
people's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I know, because you're like,
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I think that's one of the
beauties of testing that I really like.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the good side of the regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that is absolutely the essential
side, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it holds people accountable for that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've talked about this with a couple other
nutrient companies, but back in the day
[SPEAKER_05]: with the nutrient companies, most of them,
if you followed the recipe that was on the
[SPEAKER_05]: bottle, you would have a subpar product,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't a lot of R&D going done on
their side because it was illegal for one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the things that separated
us from most people over there is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: did specific nutrient application studies
for specific plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no such thing as a crop-specific
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to believe that,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a crop-specific application.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's specific recipes that work
and pH ranges that work with different
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cow mag, you know, that's always the
big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a friend of mine did the Saturday
Night Live skit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, I grow good weeds like everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I one pant leg at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to want more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely going to want more cow
mag.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to want more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an important one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I think across the board,
though, there's lots of decent nutrients
[SPEAKER_05]: available.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of really decent,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference between, I've always
preached this because people go,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference between something
that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thing after failure is
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only definition for me, of success is
not failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then way down the line on a graph is
production, is quality production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there is, there are a few
out there that don't get you all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to a quality production unless you heavily
manipulate the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that point, you're sort of just not
even really using as an intended,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and there is no other crop that is
consumed and combusted at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco would probably be, you know,
and it's still not, not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but everybody's like, Oh, I just grow
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's like, like big, everybody's
worried about big ag coming in,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is it is already here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you don't smoke
cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't smoke corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I always think that that's
the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: When big, big, big ag comes in,
you know, it's just sort of like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between a hot house
tomatoes that you see in the grocery store
[SPEAKER_01]: and heirloom tomatoes that you grow at
your own house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there is, there is almost,
it's almost not to, one is not a tomato,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: An heirloom tomato that doesn't look,
you know, that it's funky that you grew in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden that from heirloom seeds is a
tomato.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's more varieties of cannabis
than any other agricultural product out
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's way more variety and availability
of different varieties than anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look at tomatoes, how many types of
tomatoes, even if we talk about heirloom
[SPEAKER_05]: tomatoes that are available to the general
public and grocery stores, there's a very
[SPEAKER_05]: limited amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only four, there's only four at
the most in every grocery store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talk about bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might get a plantain or one of those
miniature bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then pineapples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to, just going to say
there's like four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's four.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what I just recently realized is the
varietal strains of sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and their characteristics,
which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's, it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love rum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I like sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, that was back to original
topic about, you know, prohibition and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our parents and the generations
before, you know, looking down on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're like, but they would make you
sweet tea or Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, until this day, sugar doesn't,
you know, doesn't get the bad name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It deserves the cancer causing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sugar is the single worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is worse than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is worse than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more addictive than heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sugar is the enemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does to your body and how your
body tries to process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make you diabetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kill you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feeds cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feeds cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you got a cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cold plunging builds brown fat cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brown fat cells need glucose.
[SPEAKER_05]: They require glucose to maintain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you do cold plunging,
you build up that brown fat cells,
[SPEAKER_05]: the glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even just a cold shower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The brown fat competes with your cancer
cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cold showers were good too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as a cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_05]: A cold plunge will get you that brown fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two minutes and you sit in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Two minutes, five minutes, 10 minutes,
30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do more than about two and a half.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on how cold it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I go, five minutes has been my
go-to, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the five minute threshold,
but I feel like I get the most benefit
[SPEAKER_05]: because it takes me two minutes just to
relax fully, like where I'm breathing and
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my breathing down and then I can get
three minutes of breathing into where I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: fully relaxed and I get out and I feel
just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I also do the sauna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I do that four times a week and
I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the post-workout cannabis sauna
combo.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes when I smoke, if I smoke too
much and then I try to go in, it's 10
[SPEAKER_05]: times hotter than it would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brain is like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: The one that I sweat like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like the sweating part,
but man, sometimes I just overheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became a fan of foam insulation and I
definitely think grow rooms could use
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been big promoter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built a house in Texas, you know,
Austin a couple of years ago and the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty much new then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that we are concerned
with is off-gassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a chemical process,
sort of like rosin or, or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but it basically turns your house
or room into a Yeti cooler.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying to promote that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Yeti coolers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also like rock wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know the same rock wall that's in
the grow rooms are insulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, as a, as a person who makes media,
cocoa is our, is our go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were one of the first, you know,
because it was the first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were one of the first people with
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were one of the first to realize that
one, you have to have, you have to quality
[SPEAKER_01]: source the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just go to Sri Lanka or India,
which a lot of people do and that's fine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're going to have inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to want to do your own
cocoa, just like you do your own nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: or your own tray, your own cocoa farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we worked on that and we also
realized that, you know, cocoa has been
[SPEAKER_01]: around as a media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it hit a world's fair in 18
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like introduced in 18, like one of
the first, you know, over a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: something years has been known as a
reusable media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has these unique properties that
nobody really quite understood that we put
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of research into, which is one it's,
it's cow mag deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be buffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your nutrient either, either you need
to pre-buffer it with cow mag or you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to add cow mag to the nutrient mix to get
a higher, you know, or you, you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: use hard water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we relied on when we first
came into the States was people were going
[SPEAKER_01]: to use like LA or, or Arizona or they're
not using RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using hard water, hard water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sort of, which has cow mag in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly some, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we supplemented with that,
but it's also, it's basically like banana
[SPEAKER_01]: peel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's got potassium in it and as it
degrades and breaks down, as you grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts to kick out potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need a high, a high
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time it's flowering, it's all
depends on the media size.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether you're using a one
gallon, five gallon or anything larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's gone away now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we, are we done using the 10 gallons
in production?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven's too much for the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside is a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still talking about, you know,
indoor production cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think if we're talking about
production, I think 10 gallons got been
[SPEAKER_05]: gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: My aunt and uncle used to grow living
soil, 10 gallon pots used to crush it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would have four 10 gallon pots
per light.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'd have less plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would veg for longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were getting amazing yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they were getting amazing
yields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing a two month veg on those and
you're topping them and you're really
[SPEAKER_05]: scrogging them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think they're gone for commercial.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine, you know, unless you're
doing living soil and you were reusing
[SPEAKER_05]: them, but then you just do a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can manage the maintenance and you
know, the protocol on a raised bed and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, and we're talking headier stuff than
production stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this in the grape world,
in the wine, you know, wine grape world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely believe that the
competition for nutrients, any raised bed
[SPEAKER_01]: gives you a smaller yield, but a higher
quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on the genetics, obviously flora
flame in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you have time to go check
them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're organic living soil, low tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at scale, they're doing amazing
stuff and they're in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, that's one of the guys I taught me a
little bit in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a, he had a spot right off cap in
the hood and he bought the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the mid late eighties,
but he had this grow in there and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing raised beds, the living soil
raised beds technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was some of the best fire I'd ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it's a gap, but it's a
bitch to clean and maintain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, I think, I think more and
more, I see, I was first, cause I saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch method, which is one day of edge,
two day of edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're in, you're in green and you're
going like, yeah, because it's based off
[SPEAKER_01]: the tulip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just doing flora culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we're doing is we're growing
flowers and there is a whole industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been around for decades,
excuse me, centuries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Dutch are the kings of flora
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw this, this method back early on
and I was like, Oh, so you, I would put 49
[SPEAKER_01]: in a four by four, you know, try to get
half gal pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, you know,
I get more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do I get more per four by four,
I use less light and I get more cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: more rounds down in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I knew a lot of guys who were doing
four on a four by four, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this closer to what you're, you know,
you, you were discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you're just, you're,
listen, you're putting a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: money because everything is, everything in
this world is based off time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's basically based off the 30
day mortgage payment, the 30 day rent,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 30 day electric bill, the 30 day,
the two 15 day pay periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how you should dictate
everything is by time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the less time you can, more out of
less time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more productive you're going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more profit you make at the end of
the year.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you're going to be able to
facilitate other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but now, now I'm more and more,
I'm seeing everybody go to the one gallons
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm just like, finally like,
great job gallons, you know, 16 plants
[SPEAKER_05]: per, I mean, we do nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people, yeah, we're doing crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everybody's got their own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the less veg time you do in a smaller
pot, the more plant matter you're wasting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not wasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you take a third, if you do your
one month veg, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you flower and then you harvest
and then you take all the root and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem and all the fan leaves that you can't
get more money out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes you can get a little bit
of a family 4% or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those turps, you can sell turps off
your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who would buy them,
but there's turps in those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just buy Chinese turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love the smell of turps in the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something special about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys don't know, smell your roots
next time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you grow good flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always do a good stem stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I am the, I am the king of the,
the stem stroke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, that's the, the oil,
the indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, certain, well, certain plants just
express differently too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are like, God damn this
thing's a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, but you know, getting,
getting away from that, you, you take all
[SPEAKER_01]: that product that you can't turn around
that you have to destroy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you weigh that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also take your, you add in
your, another time factor is the trim time
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, most people are throwing
a green bros or a, or a twister,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they better not be, but they
are, they shouldn't be hand trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wet or dry, wet or dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: My opinion, I used to trim back in the day
wet, but I do believe in dry trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe in hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt taught me that if anything
Humboldt and Colvillo taught me cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: cut, cut it down into big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big sizes, hands off, let it hang,
hang in the, in the barn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you know, get that two,
three week drive because the moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, I saw guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 14 days is the perfect job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what, how close to the coast
you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also, I mean, I think they control the
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't do it, uh, aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some guys who were dehumiding
and I was like, you're a cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dude, no one's, you know why no one's
buying your stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you got dehumids in your fucking dry
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you know, you want to,
you want to, you want that cure process to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then that's why I still am against
Colorado weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's 10% humidity and it turns the
powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington's the opposite where it's too
humid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got Colorado is too dry,
but any more, you can have a controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: environment if you can afford it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it depends on how,
how important it is to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like a cigar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you need a humidifier and you need
a dehumidifier.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think air conditioners have a little bit
of dehumid in them so you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can cheat a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, but you still want to,
you want to be able to control it
[SPEAKER_05]: precisely throughout the whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, and then some people go 50%
the first day and then bump it towards 63
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw heads that were IV dripping,
uh, big, big plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would stick, they would have water
dripping it so that they'd get like a 21,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, there's up on the Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some crazy shit going on,
you know, you know, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're probably doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing drugs, you know,
or, you know, or giving drugs to their
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was that one of the one is,
is a period blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody, one of the guys, yeah,
I take my girl's period blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, what a fucking hippie,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, one mindblower was growing
to the moon cycle indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first I scoffed and then I realized
gravity is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pull of the moon and anything that
it affects, you know, people are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, harvesting by the cultivating by
the cycles of the moon, germinating seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not that, uh, it's a game changer,
but it is a factor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you could consider, you know,
and it all depends on how much we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put in into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that nobody should be in
something back to the original point.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one should be in something larger than
a two gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Container.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're indoors on a production level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, I used to buy those Dutch
pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five gallon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The square ones or the one on the bottom
or the Dutch leach trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put a six inch slab in that Dutch
leach tray and then you put four to five
[SPEAKER_01]: DM, the four inchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DM tens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that's the jam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you veg that, uh, you know,
for a couple of days and then you put
[SPEAKER_01]: those in the Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut the little in the slabs and then,
uh, you know, and you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, two, three days after that,
you flower because you're only wanting one
[SPEAKER_01]: flower per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to get one, but right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your trim time is like,
you know, instead of on the green bros or
[SPEAKER_01]: the in the twister where you're just like,
Oh, you just killed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I understand commercial people,
especially with a tremors now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it used to be 200 bucks a pound up
on the Hill, but Christ now that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: half your profit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some tremors can do better than others,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like any of the trimming machines.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it ruins weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it knocks off trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing you can do about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like handle brush.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like finger trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is how I used to trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That technique though, you could tell
that's the tech right there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like soon as you get about two plants and
two, two buds in, you've got all that
[SPEAKER_01]: resin and do some of my best, my favorite
product to smoke scissor and finger hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's holistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's any proof to that's,
but it's like, it's like live rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the first capturing those live
turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is live rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a live live finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first version, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and those turps were amazing and
you put those in your joint and it'd be
[SPEAKER_05]: like on your bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put that on your bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To match the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was, those were the days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of like a vino verde.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what vino verde is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Green wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the wine you drink when you make
wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the spring, they take a certain
amount of young grapes and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest them and they process them,
you know, let them sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only at about four or 5% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're just, but it's the wine you
drink while you're making the wine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's sort of like how scissor hash
is, you know, that's the hash you smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you make hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But trimming, I mean, I used to,
all my personal, I used to keep in mason
[SPEAKER_05]: jars, like my personal, I didn't even
really trim the sugar leaf off it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd put it in mason jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I smoke it, I would trim it and smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still, I still think that's the best way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now commercially, you know, you're going
to get a consumer who's not going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All my sour diesel I used to have like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like when I gave jars to my friends,
like Leo from a fish and not the first
[SPEAKER_05]: time I met him, I gave him a jar of sour,
it was fricking, you know, it still had
[SPEAKER_05]: all the sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a, a lot of the time I'm all,
I had still a consumable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's sort of like, you know,
I can't think of any other kind of product
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the crust on bread or,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not the best part, but it's.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, is like, I think the,
the leaf, the sugar leaf and some of those
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves protect all the other parts of the
bud, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: To a degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if, if you put, and I was getting buds
where they were like big buds and I put
[SPEAKER_05]: them in the mason jar and it's like one
bud or two buds in there, they weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: getting smashed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have this big, beautiful bud that
had all these, this great shape to it and
[SPEAKER_05]: all this stuff that was untouched.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pull the peel off the banana
and you've got a perfectly good banana,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never really touched the tops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want fingers on my, but my buds
ever, you touch the stems, whatever you
[SPEAKER_05]: smell it, you can smell it, but don't be
pinching my people walk through the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't pinch my buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's not a big deal, but well,
I got introduced to this technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen a lot of people do a
lot of crazy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And half of the time I go, you're just a
cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other half time I go, you're,
you gotta be a fucking genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know I, I'm, you know,
and what is that saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every, every genius is called a,
you know, a lunatic until everybody goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, he's a genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Tyson red beard at root
cellar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he's somewhat of a recluse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way he tested bud was he grabbed
your bud right out of the bag or out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar, take a little bud and he'd go,
walk into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you're just being an asshole,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just fucking destroying bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized, no, he's getting the
S like, there's a part of me, like still
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to go just being an asshole,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just fucking with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other part of me goes,
I think you're really getting something
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a little of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of, but you know,
and anybody who knows Tyson out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like the lemon zest of your weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's zesting your bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I think he was also just
trying to see how you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, you know, back in the day,
that was money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're just like, fine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with candy, you guys make all kinds of
different products.
[SPEAKER_05]: You make stuff for hydro, like a water,
deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a organic, you have, you have
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were one of the first nutrient
companies to figure out that different
[SPEAKER_01]: medias require different, um, micro and
macro and processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got your, basically the first one
that we ever came up with before we were
[SPEAKER_01]: really a manufacturer when the,
when the owner, uh, was just making it for
[SPEAKER_01]: himself, which a lot of Dutch guys did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same thing as VanderSwan,
uh, of house and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old man was growing flowers and they
were brought, you know, they were both
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, you know, that's, uh,
the same, uh, several people in Holland
[SPEAKER_01]: were legitimate flower growers and then
illegitimate flower growers on the side as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would make their own
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, finally, one day it's
the father or the son or the uncle would
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, the brother would be like,
well, we can sell these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would get into that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically what happened with
both house and garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No relation, but just both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the first was our substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it hydro over there,
but it's a run to, I say run to drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the traditional is run to waste,
drain to waste or run to waste,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no one in America likes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're like the waste to wasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah, it has to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't use that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, uh, what we call our
substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our flagship original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was like, well, people are
recirculating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need, you don't have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use the same nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have a, you know, a pH buffer
stabilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have the nutrient somewhat
time released because the first flood and
[SPEAKER_01]: drain or so flood and drain, uh,
DWC I'd stay, tell everybody to stay away
[SPEAKER_01]: from DWC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a couple of people that crush it,
crush it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you get introduced to the
science, it'll fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water can only hold 60% oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for a plant not to have issues,
it has to be in at least 18% oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are on the threshold of fucking up
and temperature uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why most need to either be in a
cool basement or the current culture works
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've got full host power
chillers so that they can keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with the movement of the water,
heating up warm water is also the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the Aqua series is for
recirculating deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, NFT, NFT, which is gone by the
wayside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen an NFT table?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep water culture, NFT, uh, drained away,
uh, flood and drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, we realized soil is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A charged soil is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, uh, because there should be
something in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you use our substra on,
you can use it on rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the run to drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it on rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it on, uh, any of the,
uh, peat moss mixes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think King's mix is close to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a charge too much of a
charge in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, uh, or any of the King's mix is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vital King's mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones I was so surprised that
that wasn't that it took a minute to come
[SPEAKER_05]: out with that product, but you know,
well that was organic for the longest time
[SPEAKER_05]: when they took it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still in, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, in my mind, I really, you know,
I think, and I also think that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with 707, uh, the 707 bag from
roots because, but, and it's a waste
[SPEAKER_01]: fallout from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a superior product by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and if you're outdoors and you do a
short crop, you just use the bag that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so, uh, we use the, you can use
the substrate in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use the Aqua in the recirculating,
uh, cocoa and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you use our cocoa nutrient,
the liquid, uh, I would prefer you use my
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa bag, but if you don't, you could,
cause there are other, uh, rogo makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're Tupper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Tupper is superior to their
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also in sales is superior.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a charge in it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it, you know, uh, but, uh,
you want to stay away from pearl light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically people always like,
why do you, why do you put, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's destructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not reusable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, you know, we used to use pearl
light back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but it's stay away from pearl
light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just whatever you can do, I was taught,
you know, I went to Cal Poly San Luis
[SPEAKER_01]: Obispo for a while and I was taught by the
botanist and the ornamental horticulturist
[SPEAKER_01]: there how to cut, how to do cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no such thing as a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a cutting in the ag world in the
ag world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, this is not a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a cutting, you know,
but these are interchangeable strain is
[SPEAKER_05]: almost on the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original cutting and high producing
ag mix was 75% pearl light, 25% right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vermiculite constant drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it basically just goes, you know,
yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, and then we have the cocoa for
the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd stay away from pearl light and cocoa
because the properties of the cocoa or
[SPEAKER_01]: what we researched our cocoa nutrient to
be in the more pearl light you put in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, the less cocoa you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the more likelihood our nutrient
isn't going to be optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so we have an organic,
but that's going to be in precharged
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and then soil soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil, cocoa, soil for a precharged bag,
something like the roots or the basement,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, basement mix from those guys or,
or Mendo mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Mendo mix has got better is
better for our, our, our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the, uh, what we call,
um, Tara, uh, cocoa for cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, aqua for research and, uh,
substrate for run to drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got, we only have one
additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest, uh, we call, uh, either,
uh, supplements or not really a
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement, but something that just helps,
but it's not needed, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and the only additive that we suggest
is a PK because PK is a time sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got something special here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about this product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trialing this right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem, the other problem here's
the deal is we most cultivators home or,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, commercial just take quarter strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the original GH mix, quarter
strength of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your baby formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research that we did, uh, was that the
micronutrient ratio in quarter strength,
[SPEAKER_01]: full nutrient doesn't have the same that
the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this product is specifically for
seedlings popping seeds and the first two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks of a rooted, uh, cutting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because that plant needs for it
to become a mature plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is going to require different
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that ratio is, is way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very underrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem I have with this is most
people don't think it's worth it because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're lazy and they don't want to buy
another bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in the seed game or in the
cutting game, this is a game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so yeah, I'm excited to test all this
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, this with our generous,
I got some bottles of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to get your feedback on this
because I'm excited because most people
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't, they try to save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're trying to save, uh,
protocols, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you gotta add one more step in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta add another nutrient and another,
you know, again, yeah, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think also a lot of people don't
collect data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're like, well, it's not that big
of a deal, but it's like, okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: so if you can have your clones to market
sooner, your cuttings, you can have those
[SPEAKER_05]: to market sooner.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of it taking two weeks back to
our time thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the time thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we can save three days on that or
two days or even one day over the period
[SPEAKER_01]: of five years, imagine if you didn't get
in charge rent for the first three days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you only had to pay 27 days worth of rent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the analogy I like to use
on mortgage or, or, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And talking about if you're using seeds,
like let's, let's say you're growing from
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds at scale, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get a higher ratio of seeds that
not only germinate, but that thrive once
[SPEAKER_05]: they're germinated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we collect the data, so we'll be able
to go side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about that because you
are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is amazing to me how many people out
there, they know what the root temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: of the room is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what their nutrient mix is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what their dosage at or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know all that, but they're like,
but what did you, did you look into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you look into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I know it already.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does this compare to this or how does
this compare to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have to have that mindset now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like it used to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't be, we just do it because we do
it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's nothing that goes on in our
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't just do it because we do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to do it in the best way,
most efficient way possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we want to be able to give
feedback to our customers on how to get
[SPEAKER_05]: the best results, whether it's with seeds,
whether it's with cuttings, clones,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it is to get the best product for
them so they can be successful because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a tough time in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tough time everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you empower me, the more I
empower my customer, the more they get
[SPEAKER_05]: better results so that they can hopefully
make more money and continue to buy seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: or continue to buy clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I make my customers make more
money, the more they will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: likelihood of buying things from me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can foliar this, just like our
risatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I have has to, for its
application to work, no matter what liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling you, has to have roots,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is uptake in foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not of the same ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people who do cuttings and
do not have roots at the cutting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can foliar certain things like our
risatonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the minute you see roots, you want to
start feeding the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this product is inexpensive,
easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only use it for the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also too, is most people are like,
I only use it for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's at the longest, like,
you know, because then you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to start putting in a mature nutrient
solution.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Higher, higher ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with different micro and macro ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing too, is I don't
know if the world knows quite knows why
[SPEAKER_01]: the people, you know, I think luckily due
to people like you and me, and other
[SPEAKER_01]: educated people out there, there's a
reason there's three numbers on a bottle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's the ratio, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, anybody out there Google a
nutrient wheel, every nutrient has at
[SPEAKER_01]: least one other nutrient effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have more, more nitrogen,
you may affect the Cal Mag uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more phosphorus, you're
definitely messing with the PK and iron
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, you know, so I suggest anybody
go out there and Google nutrient wheel and
[SPEAKER_01]: get that image and see just for their own
piece of mind, knowing that you can't just
[SPEAKER_01]: add one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there is no, even if it says five
zero zero, there's other things in there
[SPEAKER_01]: besides nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other two numbers, the phosphorus
and the potassium aren't a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one's at 35 because it's potash and
the other is at phosphorus rock,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is 65%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people have to, I just like to
educate people on that, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of stuff is counterintuitive and
people don't want to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why there's things called soil
science degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And botany degrees and there's also,
you know, we have Google, Google and
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can learn a lot on YouTube,
YouTube for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ask your AI program.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, there's, you know,
nowadays, stop, stop, stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might not get the right information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad in, bad out.
Remember?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's all kinds of places we
can get information besides like the show,
[SPEAKER_01]: the show and other show.
[SPEAKER_01]: This show is, is just so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate people like you doing
this so that there is the ability to get
[SPEAKER_01]: data collected years of experience
information without, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going to school or trusting, you know,
we used to, I worked at a retail store and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of our shirts that I wanted to make
was on the front, it says your buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the back is full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know how many times,
well, my buddy, my friend, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are you asking me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't even know what the fuck
he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows like this, which is tried and
true tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're, you're spending the rest
of your day trying to figure out what the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the protocols and the procedures
and the, is it a half a mil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it four mils?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it once a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it every other day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it twice a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it every week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, you know, is it at night?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it during the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do I use under canopy lights to
one of my inventions that you can go ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: and have was, is the tent made out of T
fives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to have a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three, all every surface was just a
bed T fives.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under canopy light for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I wanted to do like, I always wanted to
do mylar on the floor, but it just gets
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, under canopy light for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and, uh, sounds like something
for Burning Man too.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the T five room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make it all red light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, that's the jam, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think, I think the other thing that
I want our industry to discover is what
[SPEAKER_01]: this scientific cook, uh, indoor
cultivation needs more UV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just does out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why sun grown is some of the best
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the disadvantage of environmental
impacts like wind, rain, animals,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, uh, not so much sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's less consistency that you don't
control, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but that sun, well that's my God,
first of all, you know, and the power of
[SPEAKER_01]: that sun and it's one of its aspects is
UV.
[SPEAKER_05]: The future is mixed light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, TL lighting is coming out with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always said that I don't want to
knock any, uh, and I know I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: pushback from this on LEDs, but LEDs have
a lot less UV than any of your double
[SPEAKER_01]: ended or your mogul based HIDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've lost a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you need to supplement UV
when you use LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's still a lot of things that
we're learning about light, light
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have spectrum tuning now,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, you know, we had a grand master
led Thomas from grand master led on the
[SPEAKER_05]: show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's talking about his bug light that
helps eradicate rips and mics using UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, but it's just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just scratching the surface of all
this cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think every year there's innovation made
in certain places.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been kind of stagnant on some of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were fighting the, uh,
on the led situation, the culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: people like us who have been doing it for
a long time with the get off my lawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: old man thing is there was four to eight
generations of led, uh, leds that were
[SPEAKER_01]: gimmicks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for a long time, it started with the
blur poles and I said, I'd never use LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: UFOs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are examples of why I'm so
open-minded now because I've seen,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the industry long enough to
where I was there when feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: were first seen in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like, no, dude, they're going
to ruin the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Auto flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it was auto flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, they're going to ruin the
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I breed out a flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, no, now I'm like,
well, let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm, I would rather just,
instead of saying, no, that's not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see the future that once they
have it dialed in with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's never like, I mean,
listen, uh, it's unfortunate, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff comes from other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we knew about, uh, metal,
uh, metal halide, uh, the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: high pressure sodium metal halides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And way before they were ever,
were a consumable product in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the, in the, you know, indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I want one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, they're still one of the
best mogul bases, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or plasma lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still haven't seen a, you know,
plasma lights, you know, and plasma lights
[SPEAKER_01]: have been around forever and they have,
you know, wonderful applications that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of course a lot of these things
create heat and everybody's trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the, that's the LA LED stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I realized that they're deep,
they're, you know, the DVD was way off
[SPEAKER_01]: because they didn't quite get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you actually need that heat and that
moisture from the plant or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so now you've got to manipulate that when
you use LEDs and that's not a negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just knowing and not knowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so you've got them because
you're, you're like, well, at least you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the opportunity to control the
situation and, and, and be in charge of
[SPEAKER_01]: the inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause for the longest time, the first
LEDs, people were like, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, you're like, oh, you were missing
a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're missing two or three factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you're going to have to
somewhat supplement how those you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to add heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have to add moisture and take
out moisture at certain times.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, and so, yeah, our,
our, us, the open mind thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely, you know, just like,
uh, it comes with age too.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're in your twenties, you think
you know everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then by the time you get to your
forties, it's like, yeah, you realize that
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't know shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you still think you know shit,
you got something wrong, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cause you've learned that you're not as
smart as you thought you were in every
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be focused in an expert in one
thing, but there's a gazillion things that
[SPEAKER_05]: you could focus on and become an expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't be an expert in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think that, uh, you know,
I think the, uh, I grow the best weed is
[SPEAKER_01]: gotta be one of the worst things I've
heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so, so this is an ego thing and it's
also a pride thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you take pride in it and the thing
is, is it'll blind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arrogantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is like, ego will blind you
because you've grown this thing and you've
[SPEAKER_05]: been part of its life through its whole
lifespan, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: From the time it was a clone or it was a
seed and you've grown with this thing and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's since they were babies.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you harvest it and you,
you have it in, in your mind, you're,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously some people are,
are much different than other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the guys that are the biggest
critics usually have the best weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They never think their weed is good
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, SF Canada, my buddy that
goes for SF, he, he's always trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow better weed and he still thinks he
doesn't have it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even when it's the best, he's like,
oh no, he knows when it's good,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he's, it's like, he's, he's one of
those guys that every time he has a
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest, he's like, what could I do better
next time?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like I nailed it and I nail it
every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these guys are like,
dude, my weed is the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll come up to me and they're
like, dude, the best harvest ever,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, you've got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is the best or, or my other friends
pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the pizza thing that we have
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, everybody thinks it's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody thinks they make the best pizza.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a contest between my
friends, but, uh, cannabis guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, ego is a, ego is a,
you know, there's, there's harsh reality
[SPEAKER_05]: that goes along with that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, can you sell the product?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause if it's so good, then why aren't you
selling it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it comes down to being
able to do a lot of AB testing and finding
[SPEAKER_05]: out what works best for you and for your
room and really being able to,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, distill all the stuff that you're
doing down into data.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you can analyze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's why these nutrient
companies are so successful with testing
[SPEAKER_05]: out their recipes now, because they can,
cause it's legal and they have no problem
[SPEAKER_05]: testing it on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, someone did it before anyway,
but now you can do it legally pretty much,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can do it with your clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, a lot of these guys have
chromatography that they're using for
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, you know, and it's like pretty
amazing, pretty amazing place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are doing amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I also, this is, uh, one of the
platforms that I want to talk to growers
[SPEAKER_01]: about is that, uh, price per gallon of
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shouldn't either because,
cause that's the, that has been the last
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some crazy expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it give you the same percentage like
if, so if it costs you 20% more,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you getting 20% more yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, and people would point
to me and say, well, you're the most
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive nutrient on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm not the most expensive
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, in fact, if you run cocoa AB in a
bag of cocoa and you buy one of my 1495
[SPEAKER_01]: liters of PK, I probably will cost you 50
bucks a four by four.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now, now do I sell boost?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, somewhere around a hundred bucks
a liter at full retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does it increase, uh, concentration
production?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting bang for the buck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the end of the day, it's all about
bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, things like, uh,
I always stay away from mentioning another
[SPEAKER_01]: product, but there were products out there
made by, uh, manufacturers, one that
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the game that had 13 bottles when
it first came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did change the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did change the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of it's, uh, stuff I was like,
that's just fucking like, it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: snake oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of snake oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was dark energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and listen, dark energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the other one they had?
[SPEAKER_01]: They worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they worth the price?
[SPEAKER_05]: Liquid karma and dark energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so for me, dark energy was a hundred
percent worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they banned it in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically seek help is now banned
because it's a natural PGR.
[SPEAKER_05]: So PGRs are banned.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because it's a PGR, even though it's
seek help, it is banned in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But dark energy for me, 25 years ago,
maybe even a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made by American hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was such a game changer for me though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, I didn't know what I was
doing before.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I felt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when we harvested and it was done and
we smoked it, it was like, what were we
[SPEAKER_05]: doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause this is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, you, you have those aha moments
throughout your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you figure it out, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was like, Whoa, this is what
really good wheat, when you're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what really, this is the next,
I've got to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when, as someone we were
talking about earlier, who recognizes that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't or puts it on yourself that I
may not be growing the best weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there is no such thing as the best
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can always be a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once in a while you'll see that
from like the worst grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you're like, what the fuck
did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, even from harvest to harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's, if you look at flower,
there's 70 days in the life of a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you equate it to like a human,
that's like a year for every day that
[SPEAKER_05]: plant is alive is like a year in a human's
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's so many little micro
variables that can go on within that room,
[SPEAKER_05]: within the day to day, the night,
the temps, the humidity, all those things
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can control to a degree indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, from one harvest to
the next, that's why it's hard to create
[SPEAKER_05]: constant, you know, chemo bars that are
consistently expressing the same chemical
[SPEAKER_05]: profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot harder than people think it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watering alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't, the situation may be
different that morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the retention of the media may be
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: When if you're using hard water,
the water changes throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's nothing consistent about hard
water, about the water coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're, if you're in the city
and you're using water, you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: distilling it or, you know, if you,
if you're not using RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reverse muscle muscles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, zero to five, you know,
at least, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's benefits to RO,
but it's very wasteful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, and like we have a RO system
for the misters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're so you don't get clogs and
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your water is at 160, which is like
Colorado is less than that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that snow melt that they get and even
into Denver, you know, but if your water
[SPEAKER_01]: is 160 or less, I would have to see some
hard data on why you're going to take the
[SPEAKER_01]: extra 160 out, you know, unless it's got a
specific heavy metal in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it ran through some weird lead pipes
and it's pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to prevent pathogens and you
know, you you're deceptive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's stuff that gets brought into
the water for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I mean, clean room
practices and but a lot of times all you
[SPEAKER_01]: need is a dechlorinator.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and which I would suggest
everybody who's getting water from a city,
[SPEAKER_01]: a municipal source should definitely at
least get a small boy or a large boy or
[SPEAKER_01]: any other product made that dechlorinates
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause chlorine, especially if you're doing
the living, you know, I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will change your EC though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will change your EC as it's pulling
stuff out as it's cleaning the yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you won't get chlorine, which is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, but at least let your water sit 24
hours if you're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the problem that I have with
that and I agree with that is that most
[SPEAKER_01]: water treatment places now use several
versions of, you know, chloramine,
[SPEAKER_01]: chloramide, not just chlorine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bromine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those don't intentionally don't just
dissipate through through, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't evaporate like chlorine does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you know, I would always see,
and especially if you're in soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the thing we're a synthetic
company, we do make an organic bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get it in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's unfortunate, but you know,
the rest of the States, most of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I think all, all the others you can
get a bio, but if you're using anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, you're definitely want to get,
cause you're room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're using any sort of sugar to
feed, uh, any of the cultures that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, your trachoderma and
your, uh, all the bacillus is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chlorine kills that.
[SPEAKER_01]: On purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you would want to,
if you're in a soil mix, you, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you know, and you want to reap the
benefits of having a charged soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put poison in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I'd suggest a lot of people in
the, in the hydro game like to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, H two O two in a routine maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's like treating a cold
with chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you can keep a clean system
without constantly adding H two O two,
[SPEAKER_05]: because H two O two is H two O two is a
chlorine dioxide, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no, it's a hydrogen peroxide.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which basically kills any organic material
that comes in contact with, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: radical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but if you, you know, that's it's
excessive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's HCl O two is chlorine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, which is good, which is good for
certain application, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cleaning, cleaning, um, clean all your
trays with, with chlorine chloride bleach,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do all your, if you're going to,
you know, if you're, I used to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen and I would do that with a,
and you don't need a lot of H two O two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing is you don't need a lot,
but it's only for cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not for maintenance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with chlorine dioxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like COO two.
[SPEAKER_05]: We only use that to clean the lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll, it'll go in between runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you, you, you know, it's pretty
destructive if you use it as a routine
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't use it for anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great for eating all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another benefit of ours is we
have a low salt index.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just, a couple more plugs on
Kana is we have a low, one of the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: salt indexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and that's huge for using dripper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I think a lot of pro and using
organics, you don't want to use drippers,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously, because they clog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the problem with a lot of
salts that people are using.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of salts have a lot of problems
because of that, you know, fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I don't like to bash because
salts have their place, but you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to run into issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, that, that influences your,
your, your pennies per and people go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get it for four, four cents a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, did you include labor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you include the stock tank?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you include the space that you could
have been using for something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you include your dripper maintenance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you include all the other factors?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, I was like, can I see
your spreadsheet on four cents a gallon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if it's really four cents a gallon,
I'd fucking like to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'd like to sell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, no, I didn't do a
spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just doing the simple math of a
hundred gallons and how much it costs to
[SPEAKER_01]: make you a hundred gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't include any other fucking
external factors that are involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, then, then no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and no one cares that you don't put
that on a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fucking, you know, a runt's made
with fucking three cents a gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they wouldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so people just don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what they do care about is the
quality of the end product and the
[SPEAKER_05]: branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the branding, I was just at
my friend's dispensary and we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is an age old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel somewhat sympathetic for,
and sad for the brand new generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers who care how shiny the Mylar bag
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get duped into buying inferior
products by high-end marketing all the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I love about Huckleberry Hill
farms, dude, that guy, Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little, I'm a little envious,
like which is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Jason from Ridgeline, Johnny up
there, like those guys are doing it and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like with, with good ethics,
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have a good product that goes in
and I love their flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love everything about their brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun, sun, sun burnt, sun bolt,
sun bolt is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a old hippie chick up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's, who's yeah, doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self that was just getting into
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry, what would that one piece of
advice be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably, I had lucked out by being
osmosis information and adjacent
[SPEAKER_01]: information, but I would suggest to
anybody who wants to get into this,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a few courses at a college in one
in soil science and the other is in a
[SPEAKER_01]: botany maybe organic chemistry,
those, that knowledge will separate you
[SPEAKER_01]: from all the other cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that a couple of semesters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe, maybe three, you know,
soil science one-on-one, whatever botany
[SPEAKER_01]: classes is and biochem, like, and you got
to put yourself, you got to, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: hard part is you're like, and I lucked
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other advice that I would give to
anybody is I forgot, I always forget the
[SPEAKER_01]: name because it was such a jarring
experience, but those two day seminars in
[SPEAKER_01]: management, God, what's the company
called?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's a guy it's named after
him and he, but he sends people around and
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what it is, but Tony
Robbins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Tony Robbins?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somebody else, but basically learn
how to man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to, you can't be having a
couple of duplexes or a couple of bedrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: or basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the minute you get into your position
or any other position, you got to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: management skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you don't like what the
management skill taught you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to, like, you got to fire
your junkie friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's tough hiring friends,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the toughest things ever is
hiring friends, working with, I love
[SPEAKER_05]: working with my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong, but hiring friends is,
it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So classes, I think classes that I would,
I would take classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the work culture and also,
you know, being a chef, you were also a
[SPEAKER_05]: chef.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't really talk about that on the
show, but you were a chef in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a chef in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you want to talk about a
pressure situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were, you know, I can't even watch
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife is watching the bear halfway
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm going to go outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most chefs I know don't want to go
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is post PTSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked as a line cook over there and I
worked on the grill, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: some restaurants and, and, you know,
that's a high pressure thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one thing I really love about the
restaurants is being like, basically it's
[SPEAKER_05]: a mentorship program, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you, you mentor the people underneath
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like our industry is very,
very much just like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you've, if you're a good manager,
what you do is you mentor the people under
[SPEAKER_05]: you, you teach them everything you know,
so that they can be the best person that
[SPEAKER_05]: they can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully they grew up to be like
you and do that with other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it goes on for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And carry it on, carry it on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So carry on the torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, cause you're that's another
product you're making.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything that you're doing as
a cultivator isn't just about the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about other things you're making that
become valuable out in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in some ways it's making the world a
better place, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like same thing with food.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like making good food, you're doing
the Lord's work, but you're making the
[SPEAKER_05]: world a better place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you're making people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And same thing, anything related to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're, you're involved in that stuff,
hemp, cannabis, this plant is special and
[SPEAKER_05]: you make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just by being a part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: A good part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you and I've, you know,
we've experienced the, the criminality of
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's people that have taken
away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, you know, I, I love being a part
of this, this thing that's so much bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: than myself, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just being a part of that makes me
happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, and that's contagious.
[SPEAKER_05]: That happiness is contagious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes around and people pick up on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, even if they think you're weird,
they might be interested in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what does he love about this so
much?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the shoreline is always someone
like, Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, yeah, it's the shoreline
and it's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the, the way the, the blades has super
sharp blades on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's, it's a special plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if people are trying to find out more
about you, how can they do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or where can they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to canagardening.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that information will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and you, uh, go into your local
retailer if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but canagardening.com and you can,
you can reach out and one of us will get
[SPEAKER_01]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have an Instagram too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, official Kana official Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can reach out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got some good content on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit official Kana.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've worked together on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys do a great job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, I mean, I look forward to
seeing you again sometime in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
