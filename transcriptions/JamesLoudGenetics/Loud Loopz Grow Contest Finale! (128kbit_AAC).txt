[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for tuning in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the big day where we announced
the winner of the Loud Loops Grow contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot of things over the past
six months, especially over the last two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks since I got the entries back about
fairness and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like giving people seeds and
expecting them to grow them is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a clone would give everything an
even playing field because then everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: starts with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving people seeds, you're going to get
some winners, you're going to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: losers, especially with five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give you a lot of things to
pick from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a great cultivator, I don't
necessarily think the best cultivator came
[SPEAKER_00]: in first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the guy with the best genetics who
grew really well came in first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the top 10, we narrowed it down
from 18 to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from 10, I put them in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked joints, competing them against
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I gave each one a fair chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people turned in five phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was first I had to narrow phenotypes
down for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving from there, I had to go on
and pair them against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was like smoke in the
morning and then give it a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really strong indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaning variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cultivars that you guys
selected to turn in, some of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also feel some people went a little
bit long with their harvest date.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably could have gone a little
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that definitely affects the strength
of the in the effect of the the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how I made it more of an even playing
field or attempted to make it more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: even playing field was when I did the
intake, I took everybody's product and I
[SPEAKER_00]: stored them in these Grove turplock bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like doing is taking my
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried about my flower getting
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're talking about pounds and
ounces and whatever, they make different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just take the flower right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put them in with the lid off
and put them at 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great way to store your flower long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an amazing solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad they came up with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically divided them up into these
turplock bags for storage and for ease of
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled big joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you get the most flavor from
larger joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two gram joints was my go to choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I smoked some smaller ones,
you know, and it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: because.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like after storing these in five
days before I actually smoke them,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the turps came out that weren't
there initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I looked at some of this stuff,
I was like, it looks a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, premature or some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, it's not cured out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely did the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate Grove and Turplock donating
for the contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, we're going to go
down through 10 to first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first place is ten thousand dollars
and then ten thousand to charity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second place is a two thousand dollar gift
certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a gift box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third place is a one thousand dollar gift
certificate and a gift box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fourth through tenth place,
they get a two hundred dollar gift
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate and a gift box mailed to them
that includes T-shirts and some cool
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gift certificate is good for
anything on the James Loud genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do this contest again
with clones, tissue culture clones later
[SPEAKER_00]: on this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really looking forward to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited that but let's go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10th place, we got the big green wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the 11th to 18th, I appreciate
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for turning in entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big green wave at 10th place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninth place, we got God's Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can't speak highly enough
of all these entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on looks, some of them were actually
sleepers that, you know, in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smelled pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were definitely the ones that
leaned towards like the Skittles side of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and what we had was Zerios,
which is a Zerbert times cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that times the ZBX, which is a
Skittles back cross with Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get some cereal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff lean towards the cereal
milk, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got some cereal milk Zerbert,
you know, and then there's Skittles in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones didn't look nearly as good as
the cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So God's Garden at ninth place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a relaxed atmosphere that turned
in some really amazing stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't necessarily look the best,
but smoked absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely soil grown as a lot of the
entries were soil grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budget Grower 77 at seventh place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: NorCal Cannabliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sixth place for NorCal Cannabliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifth place we got Cannabinoid Wolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend Michael Myers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like he might have kept the best
entry to smoke and turned in the second
[SPEAKER_00]: best one to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, whatever, whatever goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like his structure wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: His room was probably a little bit hot,
but his bud, although kind of loose,
[SPEAKER_00]: was super sticky and smoked really,
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 Bomb Pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He turned in colas from each of his five
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the top five is it's really so
subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into these top five with
contests, especially with people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: so passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these, the top 10, especially,
you know, not that there's anything wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with 11 through 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just weren't up to par with the top
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people turned in some really
interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to get into the third
place, which is Happy Fields Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the expressions that he
gives when he got out of these plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a lot of unique
expressions, which is really what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing all these,
you know, these seeds out, if you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow them exceptionally well, it's going
to be really hard to differentiate between
[SPEAKER_00]: the best and the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Fields Farms, his expressions,
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got a good idea of what to
expect when you buy five seeds out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pleasantly surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So second place, we got WSDJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave me five samples as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burned really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasted really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think these guys all in the
top five could be testers for me anytime I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like they did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys six through 10, you guys did
phenomenal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without ado, the first place winner,
SoCal Treesmith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll get you on an interview
sometime in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate your entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turned in one entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little over 40 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal flower, sticky, and lots of
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, candy, somewhere that has a
good structure but still has that skittly
[SPEAKER_00]: candy that really lingers on the back of
your palate, that has that long finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting doing these
contests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do more with clones,
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess let's talk a little bit about
the expressions that we got that went from
[SPEAKER_00]: various candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got candy necklace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Skittles sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all kinds of different candy in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was some really earthy
pungent gas from like the cereal milk side
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sherbert side where it's like that
earthy gassy kind of nose burn even gassy
[SPEAKER_00]: in some of the phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the market is kind of pivoting for
some of those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The candy is always going to be popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dessert strains are always going to be
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will constantly be going back to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to switch it up with the earthy
pungent ones, I would say that the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that were gassy, that had that cereal milk
kind of complexion, those ones are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that stacked harder, the ones that
probably yield more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of interesting stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really liked the sweet nose that
probably doesn't yield quite as much,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't look necessarily quite as nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really interesting, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so big shout out to SF Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave them 72 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I germinated them and give them so I could
have a baseline for kind of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as REC grows, SF Kana popped
and found some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that it stands up to a lot
of the soil entries, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people hate on cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people hate on rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not a huge fan of rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but cocoa definitely, you can crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys crushed with the 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least 10 that I think should be
grown out again that were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to SF Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are crushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you guys for tuning
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to talking with you
more about the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
