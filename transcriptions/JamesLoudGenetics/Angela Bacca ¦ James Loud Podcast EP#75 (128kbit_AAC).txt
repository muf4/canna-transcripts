[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, our special guest is Angela
Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the editor of my book, Cannabis
Breeding, the editor of High Price,
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cannabis Cancer Connection,
the original Cannabis Prohibition in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, Cannabis in Clinical Practice,
and so many other books.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's touched the work of so many other
individuals in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and she works for Oakster Dam as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we worked together every day for about
nine months, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got me focused in a way that most
people could never get me focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of that was that you were
waking up at 4 AM, and I was waking up at
[SPEAKER_02]: 5 AM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to find people that kind of
match your speed when it comes to work,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially early morning like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody likes waking up and working
first thing right out of bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was my way of finishing this
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you're a big reason the book is
actually here, that we have a printed
[SPEAKER_02]: version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you contributed the book, you know,
beyond editing and going, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think perspective in so many different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the whole getting me focused
part was great because I've been working
[SPEAKER_02]: on this book for five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tried writing this book over and over,
and I didn't have it exactly how I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this recipe for success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote this draft.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the draft was pretty good by the
time you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we still had a lot of refining to
do and a lot of work, more than I would
[SPEAKER_02]: have ever expected would go into something
we put into that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really fun project for me to work
on because I've worked on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture content and a lot of genomics
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still had this blind spot when it
came to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting to do this book filled in all
of the blind spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really fun for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's funny from the outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeding seems like A plus B equals C.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so much more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much more involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one thing making seeds, but actually
breeding and breeding towards goals and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding intention, depending on what
you're looking for in outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's just so many different
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's funny to me because the way
I've distilled it to people when I
[SPEAKER_00]: explained to them, oh, I understand
breeding now is it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except you take notes and pay attention.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Record.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of data collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with our facility,
that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's data collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collecting data on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm one of those people, I like
collecting data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like looking at things over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing flower, it's like you're looking
at that harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe you're looking at the next
harvest, how can I improve it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But with genetics, you're looking like,
how can I improve it over time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is that thing that I created?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can I make it better?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're trying to improve the
gene pool as opposed to taking away from
[SPEAKER_02]: the gene pool, which I think is what a lot
of people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not intentionally, but I think a lot of
people are just breeding to breed and to
[SPEAKER_02]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking at the whole plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just looking at the end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're looking at every little detail
about how it grows and its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that gets lost a lot when we
talk about cannabis varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: because everyone just wants to know what
kind of high they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, I think we have an
overemphasis on look in bag appeal and we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to go back to like, how does it make
me feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been talking about that a lot on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like ever since my friend Dave
passed, Dave Mesford, he was in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he passed on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've put a reemphasis at our
facility on how does it make you feel at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing this for?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing this for the effects,
the medical benefit, whether you want it
[SPEAKER_02]: for recreational or whatever, it's medical
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Dennis Perun said it best a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because even with my lowered
tolerance now, some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties I've ever smoked were some old
hippies, 1970s strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're just so much more pleasant
than a lot of the stuff today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's such a wide variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've kind of pigeonholed
ourselves into this gelato market,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you drive up to Humboldt or
you go to Mendocino or you go over to any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the other countries, there's a lot more
variety and we need to get back into the
[SPEAKER_02]: variety and looking at what's going to
improve the vigor of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to have long-term improved
effects on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I know as a patient,
that's what I get excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk into dispensary and I see
what's there, it's the variety that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: me excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one thing or the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's what we get lost
onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's never going to be the one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want lots of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's so subjective to the
individual as you've written in other
[SPEAKER_02]: books as well, that what one person likes
isn't necessarily what the next person
[SPEAKER_02]: likes or needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so subjective to the individual,
you know, across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like that narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like that, you know,
the stimulant effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like somewhere in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some people just like hanging out
and feeling a little bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the stimulant every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the thing that's going to narrow me
in and focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I've just started playing
with THCV strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine from Phylos actually sent
down an extract called Get Shit Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smoked that, it didn't taste
very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't look very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I did was made this like
big list of like the cleaning projects and
[SPEAKER_00]: the work projects I was going to take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, THCV has, you know, it's funny
because you sent me a picture of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ratios of THCV in one of the products that
you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, these, you know,
it's like we're talking about huge
[SPEAKER_02]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's an extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're talking about two to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I start reading more on some of
the stuff that was in our book.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pink Boost Goddess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Pink Boost Goddess, they're
breeding it into a one to one now,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is leaps and bounds from the stuff
we were looking at like eight years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was like showing up as a small
percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think I've been turned off
by the THCV as straight THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything for me that I
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the effect really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe as a full spectrum product,
I would, you know, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only try the full spectrum products
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already learned that lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ever interested in anything that's
isolated or artificially high in one
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got a vial of pure THCV and I
like was dabbing it and trying it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: like waking up in the morning and trying
it and then trying it in the afternoon
[SPEAKER_02]: after I'd smoked a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effect, it got me high,
but it didn't get me like an enjoyable
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like I wanted to go smoke more
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more like I was trying it because
I'd heard like, OK, well, it helps with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you're on a diet,
it helps with appetite suppression and it
[SPEAKER_02]: helps with all these things and focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I get a lot of that from just
plain THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'm looking for appetite
suppression, I need a sativa or something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's more of that equatorial that
basically is that stimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm not hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get that just from stuff that's like
super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like eating necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I smoke the narcotic stuff that's
very like strong, the first thing I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to do is eat some food or some Granddaddy
Purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, we asked too much of cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're trying to alter all these
cannabinoids to get these different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's already an herb out there that
suppresses your appetite and your sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: cravings, which is Ginestra Sylvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be saying that wrong, but that
will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will do exactly what we're trying to
get THCV to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so funny to me that we're going so
hard on breeding THCV up for this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: when it already exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink Boost Goddess is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a great section in the
book on Pink Boost Goddess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, you know, Dale Hunt is an
amazing, you know, he wrote a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: chapter for the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a couple of people,
Matt Schneider from Apical Biotech wrote
[SPEAKER_02]: the tissue culture chapter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we were working together,
this book became so much bigger than just
[SPEAKER_02]: the James Loud book of breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, well, James Loud,
my name is on the cover, but it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: contribution of over 20 people and their
hard work and, you know, a complete
[SPEAKER_02]: chapter from Dale Hunt, a complete chapter
on tissue culture from Matt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mojave did contribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggie Gadino, he was like one of the most
valuable people contributing to the book
[SPEAKER_02]: because he was questioning me on like,
do you mean this or do you mean this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the way you're writing it,
it says this, but I think you're meaning
[SPEAKER_02]: this or maybe you're meaning this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then he made me do a lot of
thinking, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so surprised by Reggie because we
thought Reggie was just going to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of do an accuracy check,
but he did a line edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he really read the book and picked
out pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's better for Reggie's line
edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also just, I always admired Reggie
before this experience, but I admire him
[SPEAKER_00]: tenfold now after working with him on this
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Reggie, he's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I thought that he was just
going to come in and read it and give me
[SPEAKER_02]: his opinion on whether it was like even
worth publishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he went in and just really read
it in detail, gave us honest feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, yeah, it's just amazing
having people like that contributing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and someone of his caliber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he basically wrote the forward in
the book and the forward is just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the best forward I've ever read in a
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens to be in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really proud to have him as part of
the contributing team that made this book
[SPEAKER_02]: so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had fun working on that forward with him
because I gave him a prompt and he wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I came back in and what I was
really trying to do is getting him to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of pull some of his unique experience that
people have not heard about or don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand in cannabis and using that to
contextualize what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he ended up liking the end
product a little bit more because of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I kind of pushed him to talk about
some things he wasn't going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't hear about it unless you
read the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's funny because I made a list of
all the people that I would want to write
[SPEAKER_02]: the forward for the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't even seem like someone that
would be attainable to have on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wasn't on the list because he was
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple of people that I
really look up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him a long time ago in the early
days of Halent Labs and back when they
[SPEAKER_02]: were Halent and had just merged over in
Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Reggie was there and he was
younger, no gray hair, but really just an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really looked up to him and I'm
like, that guy is super smart and super
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing and just super friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was always really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I was just starting to
understand what breeding was back 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm extremely blessed to have so
many great people in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Hera who did the layout,
she's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love Hera Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of changes that we threw
at her at the end and she just went
[SPEAKER_02]: through and just did such a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything is so special about the
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cover, there's actually
hidden designs in the cover that we put in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ben, who's the photographer,
did that shot and did a little photo
[SPEAKER_02]: editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's a super unique cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anyone ever actually found the hidden
symbols in the cover and pointed it out to
[SPEAKER_00]: you without you saying something?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but if anybody can guess what they
are, they get a free package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, randomly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we'll do that on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have the book, cause a lot of
people that watch our show have purchased
[SPEAKER_02]: the book and there's other symbols in the
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a fun project.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would have told me how crazy it was
going to be before I wrote it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably would never have done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years ago, when I first had thought
about doing it, I didn't realize what
[SPEAKER_02]: writing a book meant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have so much more respect for
these other authors that have written
[SPEAKER_02]: these great books.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so much to go in even smaller
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so much energy and so much time
if you want to write something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all you can do is write the best
book that you can do and then you put it
[SPEAKER_02]: out there for the world and the world
interprets it however the world interprets
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been interpreting it pretty
positively, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's been really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still getting sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I think that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think the book is really
well-rounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do more versions down the
road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when, but I'm sure we both
need breaks for a little bit before we do
[SPEAKER_02]: another version.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I have read almost every grow
book that has ever been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that even kind of touches on
cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing like this book right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it's organized, the story it
tells, but also the information it gives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I walked away understanding breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always thought that that was the
most complicated thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't anymore because it's not that
complicated, but nobody has sat down and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually put it to words in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just so cool that this
book exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something, you know, it's like,
I've always wanted, I think part of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up for me has been like,
how do I contribute to this bigger thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're all part of?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I found where my
contribution lies within the genetics and
[SPEAKER_02]: within the breeding and to be able to
write a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just as you get older,
it's like, what's your legacy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you leaving behind?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have your legacy with all these
books that you've edited and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the stuff with Oakster Dam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you've contributed heavily
to so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I want to be the Gore-Tex
for all these big brands with my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're kind of like the Gore-Tex for
all these authors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think that it's,
we're an extremely special time in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space because it's not stable
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not quite sure where it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of information to be
discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why there's going to be more
breeding books.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't got it all down.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but yours was the first that's going
to unleash the rest, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to other people
writing cannabis breeding books.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a need for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has their own opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different directions we can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: My book kind of has everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like if people want to dive
into some of those specifics, there could
[SPEAKER_02]: be a whole book on tissue culture for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could write 400 pages on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what excites me about this book
and what it excites me about cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think in any other field of plant
science, people have gotten this excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding as they do about cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a whole world of plants out
there to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this might open the door for
people to start talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, with appetite
suppression, we're all obsessed with
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding THCV and creating it from yeast
and creating patent medicines from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole world of plants that
already do these same things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get ozempic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plant that does the same thing
that suppresses the GLP-1 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called Burberry, but don't
quote me on that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My big hope with cannabis after all of
these years, especially as a patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: has always been that cannabis busts the
door open on plants in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also on health care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've had this inordinate focus on
single cell molecules as being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: cure and treat things they do not cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither do plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start understanding the
components of plants, and we've never
[SPEAKER_00]: studied anything more than we've studied
cannabis at this point, then you start
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like rethinking how you look at
health care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of an incredible thing that
cannabis is able to do for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we use plant medicine for
thousands of years, and we've only gone
[SPEAKER_02]: away from it with modern medicine in the
last 200 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and even with modern medicine,
we have this thing where we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we know this plant is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to isolate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to isolate one compound from
it, because that's the thing that does
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never the thing that does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also what cannabis is teaching
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole host of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavonoids, terpenes, they exist in other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system does not exist
to interact with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exists to interact with all of the
foods that we eat that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, as well as herbs.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, this stuff is all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cannabinoids are in breast milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have these receptors in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God it puts the babies to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we have these receptors in our
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we really need to explore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the laws are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The landscape is changing to where we can
do a lot more research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many people interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also is normalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have guys like Luke Scarmazzo that did
14 years in prison for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think Luke did 14 years in prison
for a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Luke did 14 years in prison for
telling the feds to fuck themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's 100% why he did that prison
time, his free speech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, that's the world we
live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how free are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's all just a difference of
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when even half the cannabis industry
says to you, when you talk about Luke's
[SPEAKER_00]: case and they go, well, you know,
he made that music video where he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck the feds, as if he deserved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When freedom of speech is central to who
we are as Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even have people in the cannabis
industry defending that as a reason to put
[SPEAKER_00]: him behind bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many instances of this that
have happened time and time and time
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then cannabis is still, we circle back
to cannabis is like the bad guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And slowly but surely we are normalizing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like yourself putting this in
books, podcasts where we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, where you get the normal person that
ends up finding this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They watch it and they can relate to
something that you're saying or I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, wow,
or they know somebody that had cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden they're like,
oh, well, maybe it's not so bad because
[SPEAKER_02]: they had cancer and it helped them eat
when they had cancer and they survived
[SPEAKER_02]: these miracles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Maya from Oman and she gave us a
different perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was her different perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was just basically these miracles
that people experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she pointed that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my mom and dad saw Sanjay
Gupta on 60 minutes and saw that these
[SPEAKER_02]: kids were like not having epilepsy or not
epilepsy, but they were having seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it changed the seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having all these seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started taking CBD and then the
seizures went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that was the big changing
point for my parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like a lot of people, they see these
miracles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these miracles, once you have a
miracle, happen to one of your friends or
[SPEAKER_02]: your family, then you realize maybe this
isn't so bad and maybe we were looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I talk to you about Utah just a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first, I was living in the Bay
Area for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had my husband, my boyfriend at
the time, who's now my husband,
[SPEAKER_00]: was living in Salt Lake City.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both have family there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rents were flying in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, you know, if you live with
me, your rent will be $300 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved to Salt Lake City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And decided to travel back to the Bay Area
once a month so I can still work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was the editor of Cannabis Now
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was coming back, doing my cannabis
thing every six weeks or so, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our apartment was at the base of Capitol
Hill in Salt Lake City, right where the
[SPEAKER_00]: Capitol is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved there months before Utah
became the first state to pass a CBD only
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately made a friend with someone
who was lobbying up there for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I immediately fell head first into
the situation where I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain cannabis to Mormons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for them, it was very much like they
love hearing miracle stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was also what pushed cannabis
into the legislature and said into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah legislature was the stories of these
children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was interesting is I started kind of
being I got sidelined right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was introduced to one of the Mormon moms
who was running the bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had looked me up on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said right away, I saw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're friends with gays and legalizers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, nobody wants to hear what you
have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I immediately got behind the scenes and
started kind of whispering in the ear of
[SPEAKER_00]: people about what to say to these
legislators, legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 2014, the CBD bill is happening on
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hiding in the office of Senator Mark
Madsen, who is the grandson of the Mormon
[SPEAKER_00]: prophet and also the first person to run a
full medical cannabis bill in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was sitting there saying,
I need someone to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll call up a friend who's a researcher
on this one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm connecting him to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was this whole like miracle
situation in Utah that had like their
[SPEAKER_00]: belief in magical thinking that really
turned them on to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to Utah now, you will not hear a
conservative senator say a bad thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because we turned the tide on
these medical stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still can't get over like how the
culture changed because of these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is because of the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, like we really passed legalization
in so many states because of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what really got the conversation going
were these stories of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely taught Mormons how to
dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught Mormons about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that was really like my
time to do God's work, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I helped spread it in a place
where it was never going to spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I sent a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold a bunch of seeds over in Utah for
medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think they have a really good
climate for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot, dry, high altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they did really good with my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did some indoor and it was also
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also the cultivator, really good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you I was super surprised with
that when I heard that someone from Utah,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my seeds, I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to look if they even legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy going to go, you know,
he wanted a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, OK, well, really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients who had tried to pass that
that bill in the legislature the year I
[SPEAKER_00]: was working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband graduated grad school and we're
like, let's get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we moved to Portland, Oregon almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the patients who left behind,
they didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones who are working on that bill
became the chief petitioners of Prop 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which passed in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Utah is a medical cannabis state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Producing in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people producing in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're producing a lot of bad weed in
Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have seen, I mean, I have
pictures of some amazing stuff that was
[SPEAKER_02]: produced in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only eight growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only eight legal growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's 80,000 registered patients
in the state of Utah, less than 20,000 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're growing a lot, but most of it's
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and here's the thing about Utah,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is a day drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada is a day drive away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some parts of Oregon are a day drive away,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not really buying Utah weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't wait for the day for
interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so silly that we're still having this
conversation that we can't legally cross
[SPEAKER_02]: state lines with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you can do whatever you want,
but as far as federally illegal,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't produce a shit ton in
California and then go sell to Utah or
[SPEAKER_02]: North Dakota or South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah wants our weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I was feeling,
especially talking to some old friends at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Club and getting to talk to
other people in the California industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: because California is my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis is hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until they can legally ship things out
that they were already sending anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: before legalization happened, they're
going to continue to hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and they're going to continue to do
stuff the traditional way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the best solution is for
them to, at the very least, even if they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to go federally illegal,
allow interstate commerce from legal state
[SPEAKER_02]: to legal state, rec to rec, medical to
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to let the world experience California
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Spain in 2022, apparently in
the clubs in Barcelona, they brag about it
[SPEAKER_00]: being Cali weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, nobody from California says
Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's still the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all want Cali weed just the way
people want Napa wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's mostly California genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're the epicenter right here
in California, the Bay Area, Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say West Coast, but like really
California is always, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oak, Oaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Dam, Oakland has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason it's called Oaks or Dam
because we were the epicenter for the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest time, especially, uh, 2 15,
2 15 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like booming genetics wise too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want the best and I've seen a lot
of stuff in Europe that says Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be Canadian, but it's,
you know, not necessarily right,
[SPEAKER_02]: putting California on people like
California in, in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Spain all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Slowly, it's becoming normalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Germany going online, big countries
that are going recreational as a country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got Jamaica is, you know,
we got some islands and we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think Columbia still has a
long ways to go, but they have potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico, they're going to go fully wrecked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait till Mexico goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once these things start to unfold
and then we got Canada and Mexico and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're fully wrecked, we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think it's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally silly now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally silly now, but also like for
the sake of all the people we know and
[SPEAKER_00]: love, like we need to be able to send
cannabis out of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really most of the market demands
Californian weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and the thing is, is I think other
States produce amazing, Oregon produces
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They produce so much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon is just far North California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll hate me for saying that,
but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the best growing climate in
the whole United States is actually like
[SPEAKER_02]: Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's that region, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The far North of California, the far South
of Oregon, like that is where some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially, I mean, the outdoor weed,
you know, indoor can be growing good
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who knows environment and can
control your environment fully,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can cure it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow good flour anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But outdoor, I feel like there's only a
limited amount of places that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: really, you know, that really perform
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a whole, you know, you can grow auto
flowers in certain places that you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't normally be able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alaska is kind of special.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a really short growing season,
really long light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think auto flowers go really well there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where auto flowers came from is up
at the top of the polls, right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really interesting moving
forward, you know, genetic wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: also regional and being able to,
you know, we talk about in the book a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about breeding for specific
regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people are starting to get
back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously the big companies are
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of breeders,
it's on their mind is like, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're breeding for outdoor where they
want to produce seeds, they go on an acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, are those the optimal
seeds for that location?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as climate, as far as elevation and
all these other things, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that the optimal variety for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's the problem with a
lot of these other states like Utah too,
[SPEAKER_00]: is they're trying to grow popular
varieties that were bred in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's happening all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I got guys in the Caribbean
that want to grow OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's not necessarily,
you know, and the thing is, is maybe you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to grow an OG hybrid, but you don't
want to just grow OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, or you just, you know,
it's like, I want to grow gelato and I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to grow it in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't wait for the day that they try
to breed strains that are for where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have that uniqueness to them
because any foodie will tell you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's part of why I like going
different places to try different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to get the same thing grown in a
different climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this will happen over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to like repopulate the world
with land race genetics over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I mean, through taking
genetics everywhere, finding out what
[SPEAKER_02]: works the best, it's going to be a hundred
years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're all, yeah, obviously we won't be
around a hundred years from now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the plant will still be alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question I have coming from
working on your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a land race?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a land race is not, a lot of people get
confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think land race is feral,
but land race is not, that's feral.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about feral, the stuff
that's indigenous or feral to that region
[SPEAKER_02]: that's grown on its own and it's populated
and through natural selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is not what land race is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land race is something that's grown for
several generations and selected by the
[SPEAKER_02]: people for a specific use or purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what- Most people don't know
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but land race genetics is,
as Mojave said it best, once it leaves the
[SPEAKER_02]: land, the race is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have this huge collection of land
race genetics where we're using it for
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where we can test it out in
different regions and then hybridize it
[SPEAKER_02]: and see how those hybrids work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my friend Fritzi, he's going around
next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be over in Asia looking for more
seeds for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're constantly looking for new
things for the gene pool so that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: test it and see how it performs and how it
can benefit us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think as a whole, you know,
even in 10 or 15 years, the landscape is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to change completely breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of science going
into it, but, you know, geoclimatized,
[SPEAKER_02]: we use the word geoclimatized in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Reggie told me that was a good idea,
by the way, to use geoclimatized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been criticized by people for using
the word geoclimatized because it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're putting new land race genetics
in places and optimizing those for the
[SPEAKER_02]: specific conditions that exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the idea, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trying to optimize genetics for
specific locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the future of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to say that everybody's just
going to grow indoors, that's silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have this amazing light called
the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can we can utilize that either
wholly or partially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love mixed light because I feel like
it gives you a mix of an amazing product
[SPEAKER_02]: that gets the benefit of the sun and the
light and the control of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and we know that THC production is a
response to UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: About people actually starting to breed in
different parts of the world beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: California is that there's a different
spectrum of light in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to bring out different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different terpenes, different flavonoids,
different everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can take, well, the beauty of this
plant is you can take OG Kush or any other
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar that you know, and you can grow
it here outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it in Texas, in some parts of
Texas, some parts of Arizona, Mexico or
[SPEAKER_02]: Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were to take that flower and
put it side by side, it would all look
[SPEAKER_02]: like a different expression because
phenotype is basically affected by
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition and environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second you change the environment,
you can have a completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: looking plant with different terpene
expressions or flavorants, as we call them
[SPEAKER_02]: in the book, thanks to the white papers
from abstracts tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an interesting thing that
happened while we were working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everyone was very focused on terpenes
as far as flavor and smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that study came out while we were
working on the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to reorient how we thought
about these things while we were writing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think we talked a little bit
about thyls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they came out with those
white papers, it was like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to change the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was actually really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love watching science unfold in real
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, these are
sulfur-based compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talking about sulfur-based compounds
and thyls on another level, because we
[SPEAKER_02]: just talked about thyls being like,
you know, the gas, the skunk, the ammonia
[SPEAKER_02]: that you smell and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they started really, you know,
I think they changed history on a level
[SPEAKER_02]: that people haven't done in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when we're having this
conversation about just terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: because everyone's so focused on saying
this terpene or this terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, it's just
limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much more than that a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for us to get out of this
mindset of a single molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're all so focused on this one
thing, doing this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how nature works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and if it gets me really high,
it must be THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait for the moment when we
don't care about THC in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't buy wine by looking at the
alcohol content and going, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this is the highest alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be the best wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some bums do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most people do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was your favorite part about
editing the book?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, my favorite part about editing your
book, right, was I had known you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't know you that well yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a background in in the chef's
world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a culinary experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we got to a part where you
were talking about breeding based on
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and flavor pairings, that kind of
spoke to me as an amateur chef a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of got really into that,
especially because I know when people pick
[SPEAKER_00]: out varieties, they're always looking at
how different flavors and scents make you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel and how you seem to be naturally
attracted to things that will make an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to you made me buy the flavor
Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of the best books out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I took it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I cook all my own food from
scratch, raw ingredients because of my
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that chapter like spoke to me in a
way that I like went home and started like
[SPEAKER_00]: studying flavor pairings in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really a cool experience
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of like, don't just enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just sniff stuff and smoke that you
like, but like really make this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's kind of what I pulled from
your book, which was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could only get that from a chef's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the thing is, is with
breeding, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: directions you can go and there's no one
right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody has their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially with the selection process,
because it's so subjective to the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, as a chef,
there's some breeders that breed,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just breed what they want and what
they would smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a great way to do it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, Oh, this is what I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to breed this because I love
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a beautiful approach too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my approach is as a chef is I know
what people like, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As a chef, you have to learn what people
like, even though I like weird stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like weird food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like exotic stuff and I like
octopus with olive oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And crunchy salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to try it now that you said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, especially Mediterranean octopus
is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it has, especially if you do it
right with the potatoes, you have soft
[SPEAKER_02]: potatoes and then a little paprika on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this, this flavor
combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I dissect cannabis just as I would
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I reverse engineer everything that I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly like, okay, how can we pull
this apart and look at it from each
[SPEAKER_02]: component and try to optimize it,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes that, you know,
with cannabis, it's like, there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different things too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it also this day and age,
we want stuff that is, that will function
[SPEAKER_02]: in a large scale facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just something that like,
even though I love breeding for flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and we might save something
that's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't necessarily release a cut of it
or anything like that, but we have that
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have that on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use it for breeding because it's so
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it has to be commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so unfortunately, I guess,
unfortunately, unfortunately, these are
[SPEAKER_02]: all just breeding goals that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're going to sell seeds,
people want to get a certain yield off
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just a reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that needs to be one of the check
boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like does it yield or what does it yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can inform people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is lost when we focus on yield or
THC, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is like the
education that the consumer market is
[SPEAKER_00]: missing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's same with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we focused on the apples that produced
the most, we want to get the apples with
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait till cannabis kind of
comes around to these understandings we
[SPEAKER_00]: already have from eating.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and there is a balance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there's a balance and a threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a point where it's like,
if it yields so much, it's probably not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never commercial agriculture is high
yields translate to great flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at wine, you look at produce,
you look at pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times they're having to pump
synthetics into it to get it to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones someone grew at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grown by grandma or grown by me or whoever
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like those, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm an Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make a lot of delicious tomato sauce and
I will not make a tomato sauce with store
[SPEAKER_00]: bought tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got to go to Berkeley Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have to go to a good store and
get the fancy tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eating the fanciest tomatoes at the
best stores aren't as good as the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that comes off of my vines at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that make your fingers smell like
tomatoes because of the terpenes.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the stem rub and I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that green smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I just love, I love
tomatoes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have Crohn's as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I really don't eat a lot of
tomatoes because they're nightshades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has Crohn's now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got a digestive disorder now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So totally autoimmune diseases are just at
an all time high for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some theories about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is immune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff in general, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is like, there was a study that was done
on the border of Poland and Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poland is part of the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Poland, it's like super sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in their train stations, they keep
that shit sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do the same thing in Russia,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also map out incidences of
autoimmune disease on that border and find
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are like 10 X higher on the
Poland side than they are on the Russia
[SPEAKER_00]: side, despite people having similar
genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sterility is on the side where everybody
has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think it's Western civilization
and the diets that we live on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's so many contributing
factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just one thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glyphosate is a huge one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just our diets, we're not eating
as nutritious of produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the protein has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have more diversity in our
diets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at the lettuce and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's completely different than it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the 50s and before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think pesticides changed after
World War II.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has an effect on it, possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not an expert on all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always trying to think about like
why I am the way I am, because I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of food allergies, a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also cannabis helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I have a slight cannabis
allergy, it gives me a little rash,
[SPEAKER_02]: which it does to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get rashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually ingesting it helps me if I
smoke it, more than if I eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really feel great when I eat it,
as great as I do when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like eating weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always prefer to inhale or tinctures at
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I prefer inhaling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tinctures are OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm OK with some tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amber alchemy tinctures are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best tincture I have ever had,
I made myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here was what was in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using a volcano vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was dumping my leftover vape into a
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put some fresh bud in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put some fresh decarboxylated
bud in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was like a sausage of like
cannabis leftovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a tincture out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never felt better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I handed it out to other patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew they loved the sausage
leftovers as well, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's because of the diversity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the diversity of what ended up in
that jar at the end was something you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't recreate on a commercial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and from one batch to the next,
it's going to be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't recreate that tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could never recreate that tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's, you know, homegrown
flour is a lot like that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: From one batch to the next, it comes out
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who says they grow A++ plus
weed every time, they're kidding
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like the best growers,
it's always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like certain growers, myself included,
I feel like it's always good when I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's times where it's just above
and beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a special round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the genetics just performed really well
that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you get to know a certain cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, OK, well,
I know that we need to veg it a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to top it a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really loves when I clean out the
undercarriage completely and thin quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more than other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some things, they don't like to be
thin the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So knowing your cultivars is like half the
battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote this article about cannabis and
Crohn's in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had people to this day still
reaching out to me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I regret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I regret it because I made it sound
like cannabis is what put my Crohn's in
[SPEAKER_00]: remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't understand at the time that
that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a really important thing
to talk about because I've had so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main question they ask is,
what's the strain I should use for my
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hate me because every single time
I give them this long complicated answer
[SPEAKER_00]: that the TLDR is, I can't give you that
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no good answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cannabis can't cure Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one thing that you can buy
that's going to cure your Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to eat a whole food diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to cut out sugar and processed
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally avoid fried foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, fried foods was the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, I got Crohn's worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out of remission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fully when I quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarettes are terrible for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I quit smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And forced to quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I quit smoking and I was fine for like
the first six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got like the worst I'd ever
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lost about 25 pounds in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were you forced to quit smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I had to pee and it was really
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read this study called care and feeding
of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really what changed my perspective
on a lot of this because it was a survey
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a study where they look
at 15 people and report their results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is researchers looking at the body of
research that exists and summarizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at pharmaceutical drugs,
alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: can affect your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What balances it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What upgrades, up-regulates it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What down-regulates it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was what keeps the
balance in your endocannabinoid system was
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, hydration, exercise, whole food
diet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these aren't things I can sell to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody ever wants me to say this to
them that there's not one thing that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: fix this, but that is what will fix it is
a radical lifestyle change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the easiest thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of it for me starts with
exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've lost a lot of weight this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started with just going to the gym
and waking up and doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I had to sit in the car 30 minutes
and thought about going to the gym,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I got in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the lifestyle changes
aren't easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your mind will tell you the opposite,
like, oh, you don't need to do this or,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you're getting up a little later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need to go to the gym today,
or you don't need to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times you just got to
prioritize yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also live these lives that are too
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what makes our health
degrade, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it's really hard to schedule in gym
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to schedule in time to
make your food from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why people eat processed food is
because you can just throw it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth while you're driving somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll pay the price for that
cheapness later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, I love cooking as a
chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love taking the whole day to prepare a
meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you go shopping and then you
spend a few hours cooking, minimum a few
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, sometimes five hours cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like this whole meditation side to
that that I love like getting going back
[SPEAKER_02]: to like a culinary school where I learned
knife skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love cutting my vegetables all
exactly the same size and perfect dices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little vegetables is what makes food
so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these things, but I don't have
time for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I eat pretty basic now,
but like I'm able to cook my meals really
[SPEAKER_02]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do a lot of whole food, like steak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do steak and chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do steak with chicken, love steak by
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chicken by itself and I love them
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do these burritos now, they're like
steak and chicken burritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a vegetarian for 15 years and I
had to like break that seal to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get healthy because basically I eat meat
and vegetables now and that has been my
[SPEAKER_00]: life saving situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a severe case of Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a third of my colon surgically
removed and moving to a diet with no
[SPEAKER_00]: processed foods, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meat, fruits, vegetables has been kind of
what has really put me in remission more
[SPEAKER_00]: than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal has been to not need cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I need cannabis and I use cannabis
instead of a Tylenol or something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you do an elimination diet to figure
out what worked and what didn't work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like the diet that I'm on is called
the specific carbohydrate diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't work for you,
there's four things that you remove that
[SPEAKER_00]: are okay on the diet to see what's causing
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eggs, nuts, legal sugars, as they call it,
which is from fruit and honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out depressingly that it's
eggs for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just cannot eat eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do 10 egg whites before I go to bed
every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't love me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I cut eggs out of my diet,
my life changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then where you tried, before you had
any part of your intestines removed,
[SPEAKER_02]: did you or your colon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Colon, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, yeah, I mean, that's,
that's a pretty serious operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize how important your
colon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until there's a problem with it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you quit, you were smoking
cannabis and tried that and it didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: fully work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's funny, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I started smoking cannabis in high
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned my life around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was intentionally failing myself out of
honors classes in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a Catholic high school and I was
so mad about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was intentionally failing myself out
of these classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get high for the first time and I'm just
like, well, shit, if I go to college,
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to leave this bum fuck town,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden I start turning in
straight A's and I start smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting symptoms at about the exact
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I was diagnosed, I had just
turned 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was days away from moving to San
Francisco for college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this weird mindset, which was
like, well, you've got a serious illness
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first six months in college at San
Francisco state, I was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: miserable cycling through prednisone and a
bunch of other drugs and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: starving myself to get through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't feel symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had emergency surgery during my spring
break to remove the first section of my
[SPEAKER_00]: colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right after that, I started going to
doctor's appointments in San Francisco all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd pick up the free newspapers while
I was on the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the back of the free newspapers was
all kinds of cannabis ads, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to a cannabis doctor for the first
time and I go crack Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that enough to get a card?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh yeah, definitely.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the first time I got a
card and I didn't take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was buying weed from my roommates
because I was the one who could get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: club.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely started moving towards
being a more natural, organic type of
[SPEAKER_00]: person who didn't take pharmaceutical
drugs because of that, because I'd walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, like these are these old
dispensaries in San Francisco where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're giving you a Ziploc bag with a
computer printer label on the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are smoking in the sales floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I met people in there who were
patients and they were talking about pain
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started like thinking about my own
use in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what pushed me on the
path that I ended up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some really cool clubs in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary and 14th was the big one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14th and Mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go there quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was one on Ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to, I used to vent all these places
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Spark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine or my friends or, you know,
Spark was a big deal for me back a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to, you know, they were amazing,
great company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they, they bought CO2 when it
was crude and we're using it for edibles
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends got the first like Eden Labs
extractor when it was for CO2,
[SPEAKER_02]: when it would just pump out peanut butter
looking crude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't really smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to convince everybody
that, yeah, you just smoke it and it's way
[SPEAKER_02]: healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was like, it was the crude of
crude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like crude oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spark ended up interested in purchasing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of helped pay for their
machine, which was great at 20 bucks a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram back then, which I think it's
probably for that kind of stuff would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar a gram now or a couple of dollars a
gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, there was Steve D
'Angelo and Andrew over at Harbor side.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew Sean and Mary well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where my wife and I both got our
cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, Frank Losito was my first doctor that
gave me my card.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He should have written a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he, he still could, but he just
retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Writing your book is not like a casual
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a big fucking project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an undertaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I mean, people don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't know how much goes into
a book as far as like, I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I could maybe do the layout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could do the graphics or all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to get a graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had multiple graphic designers,
multiple photographers, an editor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Reggie who helped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, you know, there was just so
many people that contributed this or that,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a handful of photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, we need photos of land race
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't grow a ton of land race
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I plan on, but as far as like,
we went to several people and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then people said,
oh yeah, I got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they don't respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get them, they may not be high
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to feature a lot of case
studies in the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing text box case studies and
books, especially like your book,
[SPEAKER_00]: because your book is a textbook,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's an information load,
but then there's also giving life to the
[SPEAKER_00]: information and the text box give life to
the information and being able to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about specific strains that people know,
I think gives life to the content.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fully your idea, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that just, you know, and then I
would, then you gave me the idea and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, okay, let's run with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do case studies on this and case
studies on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I wrote more case studies than we
included in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a lot of that came from the first grow
book I ever worked on between 2008 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a student at Mills college at the
time, and I had brought my own textbooks,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that we were making this one is an
Oaks True Dam textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember that was the thing that
stood out to me as case studies about
[SPEAKER_00]: different businesses to explain the
business concepts we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled that into that first grow book
that I did in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just something that's carried
over in a lot of the cannabis textbooks
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've done because there's giving
information and there's giving life to
[SPEAKER_00]: information and those text boxes that just
does it in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about high price because I
think that is an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the one who introduced me to Luke
Scarmazzo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had him on the show a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We filmed some really cool stuff together.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you met him when he was in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting because I heard
about Luke a lot before I actually met
[SPEAKER_00]: him, because he was the guy who made the
music video where he goes, fuck the feds
[SPEAKER_00]: and the feds said, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put him into a federal prison
with a 21 year sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right around the time that Obama
was about to transition out and Trump was
[SPEAKER_00]: about to transition in both Luke
Scarmazzo's daughter and his partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricardo Montez, his daughter were doing a
change.org petition trying to get Obama to
[SPEAKER_00]: pardon their dads.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I talked to Ricardo in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Luke in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended with Ricardo getting that
clemency where Luke didn't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: clemency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really enjoyed talking to Luke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turned into the situation where Luke
and I kind of became pen pals for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right before the pandemic,
Luke ended up in solitary confinement for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time, a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He traded a lot of his meals for paper and
pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote a book and he knew what I did
for work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, Angela, can I send you my
book to check out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have sent me books that
they wanted to publish over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I skim through them and I'm like,
oh, this is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start reading the next three or four
days after I woke myself up early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I wake up early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up even earlier, turned the coffee
pot on so that I could plow through more
[SPEAKER_00]: of Luke's book because it was so so well
written and so engaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when he did come out of prison,
he was like, let's publish this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting is the original
version of the book ended with him in
[SPEAKER_00]: solitary confinement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you read the book, the way it was
at the time, it was it was a tearjerker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I broke down crying at like five o
'clock in the morning reading the ending
[SPEAKER_00]: of this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he gets out of prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some time goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Luke, let's talk about
prison a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like the book doesn't talk about
being in prison right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just talks about what happened leading
into prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So him and I went into this back and forth
where we were talking about his prison
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, where we could really actually
the book is called High Price to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the cost, like what life was
like for 14 years in prison for Luke
[SPEAKER_00]: Scormazzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we pulled out of it just
brought the book so full circle,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also made a stronger point than we
could have made while he was still there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because now he can speak more freely about
his experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really good book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really well written.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've really enjoyed him coming out to
the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about doing some seed
drops together and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love seeing him travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, his Instagram, he's he's a,
you know, he's a traveler.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been going all over everywhere to
events, whether it's the California State
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair going over to the East Coast doing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in Miami and in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's he's been traveling all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, his brand Profit is doing really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're just growing
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great seeing someone like him who
really deserves the success of
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational cannabis, you know,
growing along with this with the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, Profit actually has good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's not a lot of good weed in
the California market that's legal these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, Luke has an enthusiasm for this this
industry and this world in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: other people in the industry definitely do
not have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was born of spending 14 years
mostly in solitary confinement.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just he's just happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just generally he's always in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and Mandy are always in a good mood
and it's great seeing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's that kind of stuff is
contagious.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already became my friend when we were
prison penpals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like now that I know him in the real
life, like I just love that guy so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke is so cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us about your other books that
you've been working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Cannabis Cancer Connection is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Cancer Connection is a really
cool book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written by a guy named Joe
Goldstretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an MD at FACC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting about Dr. Joe is he
started his career as a fellow in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hospital in Dallas and he was one of the
seven people who was in the room when JFK
[SPEAKER_00]: came in with a head wound that took his
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really shaped Dr. Joe's
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became a pretty well renowned
cardiologist over his experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was always kind of health conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this was the 60s when he was
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when after he retired, he found that
he was like kind of depressed because he
[SPEAKER_00]: had nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had already been a California
certified physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came out and started writing
recommendations in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just started learning from his
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a patient, I appreciate that about
a doctor is that he learned from his
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that really hit Dr. Joe was
patients with cancer because he was
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that some people were saying they
were experiencing these miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: recoveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd also have patients who did
the same thing they read about online and
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have the miracle recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because his background was in research
and researching materia medica,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he used to get big paper stacks of
research and go through them to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: he made cannabis and cancer or something
that he just dove head first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this book is a summary of basically
every piece of cannabis cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: research that's ever been done in the
world, summarized, but contextualized with
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some, like there's some
pieces in there that explain and he'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: into what I was saying earlier about the
endocannabinoid system and diet and
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle and how all of that actually
affects cancer, cancer care more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He points out when you shouldn't use
cannabis, when there are actually any HPV
[SPEAKER_00]: related cancer, he points out in the book
does not respond well to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: More importantly, there's a chapter in
there about immunotherapy and
[SPEAKER_00]: immunotherapy has become a really popular
cancer treatment because for the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have cancer that it affects,
it really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will just knock out your cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are using cannabis for the
symptoms of things like immunotherapy and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use cannabis while you're getting
immunotherapy, it makes the immunotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something he had pulled from the
research, but now he's experiencing in
[SPEAKER_00]: real life because he was recently
diagnosed with a cancer that responds well
[SPEAKER_00]: to immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he followed his own advice and the
cancer is going into remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an update of this book coming
soon, but I just really appreciate what he
[SPEAKER_00]: did with this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like his life's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the origins of cannabis prohibition.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale Garenger, PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is like the long time head of
California normal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's written this book, which is
originally published in, I think 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might need to check that later on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He pulled out some pieces about how
California became one of the first states
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States to prohibit cannabis,
which is so hilarious considering we were
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones who busted this opus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it was based on racism,
which are the stories that we knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just like a really
interesting story that looks at the
[SPEAKER_00]: politics between like 1910 and 1913 that
led to California, like leading the way in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cannabis in clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis in clinical practice was
originally written by my really good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, Dr. David Behrman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who knows Dr. David Behrman loves
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's based in Santa Barbara, which is near
my hometown.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked for governor Ronald Reagan's
drug task force.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has some pretty interesting
credentials, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I first met him at hemp fest in 2010 or
12, and I've worked on a handful of books
[SPEAKER_02]: with him up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it blew my mind that this like doctor
that I had just met was like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to smoke a joint on the rocks,
which is what everybody does at hemp fest,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I ended up sitting there and
talking to him for a while, finding out
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was from Santa Barbara,
which is near my hometown, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Barbara County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we became friends through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis in clinical practice was him
trying to put into words all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that doctors typically get
about a drug that they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe their patients, but they will
never get for an urban, especially not
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he put that all into that, into this
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's four authors on this book,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second author Maria Pettinado is
teaching cannabis class that was brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: at the college of nursing at Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she adapted the content for her class.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next MD who jumps in is Dr. Carolina
Nasseri, who is from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she has like actually led medical
cannabis in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's testified in front of the Brazilian
Congress for medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but her and her team did deep studies into
autoimmune diseases and a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and how cannabis affects that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she amended the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I took a final pass of this book
from a patient's perspective and from a
[SPEAKER_00]: very educated patient's perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what became this book,
which is cannabis in clinical practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically everything a doctor
needs to know before they start
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending cannabis to a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more books like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: More books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people read books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think digital books are a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people like a lot of people like
digital books, but I still like books and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why I wanted to write a book and
you know, it's a Luke's book is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really read books normally,
but I like Luke's book was an exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it to me early on right when it
was coming out and it was a really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really good book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think books are going?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's interesting though,
cause like I read a lot of books and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of books I read that I don't
necessarily want on my shelf and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want other people around me to see that
I'm reading, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like trashy novels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Books like your book are the kind of book
that I want on my bookshelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it as a reference that I can pull
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I think that that's kind of
where books are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the books that you want on your
shelf, the books you don't want on your
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your book is a book that I want on my
shelf because it's the kind of thing where
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a quick fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know where to look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know your book, like the back of my
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know where to find what I'm looking
for in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have the file.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can type search.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so could anybody who gets the ebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also work with Oaksterdam
doing a lot of stuff with Dale over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oaksterdam isn't just in Oakland
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have spread out all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are working, you know,
in several countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to talk about that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working with Dale at Oaksterdam
to produce a book, The Budtender's Guide,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was based on a lot of their
curricula and the curricula is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale brought me in as the director of
academics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I produce all of the curricula at
Oaksterdam University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been such a crazy experience
for me because it's definitely pulled on
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my skills, strengths, and knowledge
in a way that no other job possibly could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate working with
Oaksterdam because we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: people who actually are going to have a
major impact where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all very saturated in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with students who are
opening businesses in places like
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut and New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have no background in the history
of what is here or all of the weird deep
[SPEAKER_00]: context that you and I might have on some
of these topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really exciting for us to be able
to provide it, but it's really excited for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be able to get that information
from somewhere like Oaksterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have the most unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I think is really cool for
me about working with Oaksterdam is I've
[SPEAKER_00]: known Jaff and Dale Jones for over 15
years, but I've always been Oaksterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: adjacent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never worked exactly with them,
but I was around during Prop 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was around while they were doing their
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've always understood the
historical context of Oaksterdam and where
[SPEAKER_00]: they fall in this legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that many people in the
world really understand what Oaksterdam in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular did to make cannabis legal
everywhere and for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may never know unless we keep talking
about it, but Oaksterdam had the most
[SPEAKER_00]: central role in what is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they were the epicenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We called Oakland Oaksterdam, and then
they started a school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty amazing how many students have
gone through Oaksterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of my friends and colleagues have-
110,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people went for weekend courses,
and other people have gone for longer
[SPEAKER_02]: classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming from culinary school, I'm not the
hugest fan of culinary school for
[SPEAKER_02]: education, but I feel like with
Oaksterdam, it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a lot less expensive than
culinary school for one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do it on demand now,
but also you can pair it with growing-
[SPEAKER_02]: just like you can cook at your house,
you can grow plants at your house,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it can empower you to get a job in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 110,000 people from 116 countries have
gone through Oaksterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people were seeing Oaksterdam
on the news, coming to Oakland,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about the cannabis industry,
and taking it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they have a big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your point about culinary school that's
interesting though is being a chef is a
[SPEAKER_00]: creative job, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's technical skills you can learn,
like a photographer or a writer or an
[SPEAKER_00]: artist, but there's also that innate piece
of you that understands this thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's the whole mentorship side of
the culinary industry where it's- I talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about this on my show a lot, but it's
passed down from generations of chefs,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you work under somebody as an
apprentice, and you learn all the skills
[SPEAKER_02]: from them, and then you make it your own,
and then you pass those down to somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that the cannabis world is a
lot like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there was a lack of
information out there, and there was a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people- if you didn't know the right
person, it was hard to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now slowly but surely, you can go be a
water boy for somebody and water plants or
[SPEAKER_02]: go trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people got started trimming at a
very young age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's working your way up in any
industry is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be in the restaurant
industry and you can't get a job in the
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen, you can be a busser.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go- It's the only way to do it is
to understand the whole business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go wash dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing, go clean pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go clean pots for whatever grower- if you
can get in, you can get in, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: someone likes you and they see that you
have good work ethic, and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: grow with the company, or you can grow out
of the company and then evolve into
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't teach that innate part of you
that understands how to pair flavors or
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with creative things to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing with breeding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't teach a photographer to have an
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can teach them all the skills to use a
camera, but you can't teach them how to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the same thing with chefs
and breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I think a lot of stuff through
repetition- you got to start with the
[SPEAKER_02]: repetition part because a lot of people,
yeah, they have a natural gift for some
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but unless you put it in the hours,
you'll never get good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's exactly it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have that innate sense in you,
but if you don't understand the technical
[SPEAKER_00]: skills, you can't perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know firsthand, I am such a better
writer after working with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if you look at how the first
draft came out and then as you got me to
[SPEAKER_02]: rewrite stuff and think about what I'm
writing and how I'm constructing sentences
[SPEAKER_02]: and paragraphs and trying to tie it all in
together, because you had a specific way
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing that, which was very different
than my way was like, let's just throw it
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, you need to have an
introduction that kind of says it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you write about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put everything at the top and then you
expand on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always considered myself a writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not become a good writer until I
became a good editor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and sometimes it takes stepping
outside the box a little bit so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I fell into this niche of cannabis
because I did one cannabis book,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did another cannabis book and shit,
now I know more about cannabis than anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's never grown cannabis, bred cannabis,
been a cannabis doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you know it from so many
different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've known from the authors that I've
worked with that that's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've liked working with me is that I
can kind of extract things out of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they wrote and beat it up and question it
in a way that someone who's not a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: professional or a grower or breeder could
never do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were able to get me on task every
day, which is something that's a challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: for, you know, the best of the people that
I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess sometimes you just have a good
relationship with people and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something where you can sync up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I work better with some people than
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a specific style.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm also a workhorse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind being the workhorse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to have a path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I need to dedicate each morning
to doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a great organizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a great editor, a great manager,
but I'm only as good as the person I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was all you first day on task and
actually taking it and running with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just waking up knowing that
this is what I'm going to do for the day
[SPEAKER_02]: and I need to knock this list out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it wouldn't be that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be the next day or the day after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would wake up and put energy into it
every day and prioritize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of times in life,
we just got to prioritize stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe you had an innate
understanding of the fact that a book like
[SPEAKER_00]: this did not exist yet and that you were
creating the base that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to work from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like a response and a
responsibility that comes with being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to build something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder a little bit if that's kind
of what motivated you to finish the book
[SPEAKER_00]: was the fact that you knew that that's
what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told by somebody that I couldn't do
it and I wouldn't have a book by Christmas
[SPEAKER_02]: or the year after that it would take a lot
longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I was 46 years old at the time
and I had told people that I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a book out and that was like four
years before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that this was my last shot
at doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I didn't do it, it wasn't going to
happen and I was going to give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't want to give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to tell people that I was
going to do something that I didn't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was all these different pressures
pushing me forward, wanting me to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was also, I would remind myself of
those things when I was feeling lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and I'm kind of like,
I'm just wired like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can create my own type of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, I like, I'm a high
functioning, I function really well under
[SPEAKER_02]: stress, but I, you know, not high
functioning alcoholic, but I'm a high
[SPEAKER_02]: functioning person under stressful
situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that comes from the kitchen too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where you have this long line of
tickets and orders that have to go out and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like, no one's going to
come save you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to pull your pants up,
look at those tickets and just do it as
[SPEAKER_02]: fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of times people are just
so, they're waiting for someone to come
[SPEAKER_02]: save them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That person's never coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a bartender and waitress in downtown
San Francisco before I got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have anxiety dreams about the
tickets stacking up and getting the plates
[SPEAKER_00]: out on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nightmares.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I had a nightmare
about the ticket counter, but like the
[SPEAKER_02]: ticket machine just running or the ticket
machine breaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two where it's, you got
tickets on the floor or the ticket machine
[SPEAKER_02]: is broken and the restaurant's packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's happened several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I guess that's why I still
have that reoccurring nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is the restaurant is packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only bartender and waitress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have that dream to this day and I
haven't worked there in like 20 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there was one piece of advice that
you could give your younger self coming
[SPEAKER_02]: into the cannabis space, since we have a
lot of people in cannabis watching this
[SPEAKER_02]: show, what would that one piece of advice
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, see that's interesting because I was
never trying to get into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was never a goal of mine was to
work into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a hard question also because the
cannabis space is really hard right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't a lot of opportunities the
way they're used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a temporary situation until
federal law changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say, so here's what I would
say, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone who's a professional writer and
editor, I wrote for five years for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who would publish me, I wrote for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not care if I was getting paid or
not because I believed in myself enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that if I got my writing out there
that someone would eventually pay for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took five years, but then I had a very
solid career built on people paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: what I could write and what I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is something you actually
really believe in and you want to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially creative work, chef's work,
writing work, artistic work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, if you stay the course and you
work that side hustle, you will get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so that was going to be my next
question is if somebody wants to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: writing about cannabis that they're
passionate about it, what would the best
[SPEAKER_02]: route be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell them not to focus on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't pigeonhole yourself to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been like one regret I felt in many
ways is that I felt I got pigeonholed into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because it's a niche that I fell
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, still today, I'm going out of my
way to work on projects that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to this world than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know so much about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy for me to continue to produce
content about cannabis, but there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many other things that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's mushrooms, there's all kinds of
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the mushroom industry is like a whole
other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more I've learned about healthcare
and cannabis, cannabis has opened my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: to so many other things, the more I've
felt compelled to write about other
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we can start looking at
cannabis outside of the box of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and into how cannabis is going to change
how we do other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding, medicine, lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug discovery and all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of it comes down to
healthy living.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug discovery, like that topic itself,
like still kind of irks me a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's still based on this premise
that we're going to find this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cure or treat your
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll never find this one thing
that's going to cure or treat your
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only you can cure or treat your problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but drug discovery is like that one
thing that we can patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that one thing that we can
patent that does this for this,
[SPEAKER_02]: or that it took us these steps and we had
to do this type of extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, I see drug discovery as
an amazing thing because it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, so we've done all these tests like
they do in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we have these double-blinded tests
and we're looking at large populations of
[SPEAKER_02]: groups and we're giving, you know,
trying to solve problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a problem solver as it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at everything I do is to solve a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like the whole drug discovery
from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, can we solve a problem with
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more we know about it,
the more problems we can solve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we can get rid of ulcerative
colitis and autoimmune disease someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it won't just be cannabis,
but maybe it will be this combination of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is the drug discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's the beauty of drug
discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the more we know, the more
informed we are, the more we can make
[SPEAKER_02]: better decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we will find something that
makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it won't be the only thing,
but maybe it's something special and
[SPEAKER_02]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's important about this drug
discovery threat is that through trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand these single molecules,
we understand the mechanisms of action and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they work in the body, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like how we found Ozempic is
understanding the GLP1 and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: affects your appetite, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this conflict when it came to
learning about medical cannabis and going
[SPEAKER_00]: to these medical cannabis conferences and
hearing them talk about these new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids they discovered and the
pathways they work on is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this knowledge we have about how
these cannabinoids interact with our body
[SPEAKER_00]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conclusion is always, so we're going
to make a product that you can buy based
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the wrong conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that conclusion is what drives
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like this weird balance with
it, but patients in particular need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take some more control of their own
healthcare, more autonomy of what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they're really going to
find their answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, because it's all subject to
the individual, so much of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we all need different things and we
all have such different body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with autoimmune diseases,
especially something like Crohn's disease
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, a lot of this comes down to
the balance of bacteria in your gut that
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts with your immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going on in my gut is not
identical to what's going on in the gut of
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else with Crohn's disease,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in my gut in the morning
is not the same thing as what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: to it in the evening or after eating this
food or that food.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we actually start studying nature,
we start understanding diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with diversity is there's
never one single solution to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always more complex and complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and for thousands of years we ate so
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's thousands and thousands and
thousands of years, as long as we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: on this earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have tomatoes year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but people like me, I eat
seasonally, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I base most of my food off of a vegetable
box that comes from a local organic
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who are growing seasonal produce
once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I plan my meals is based on
what the fruits and vegetables that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that not everyone has the
time to cook their own meals, but I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people are trying to find you on the
internet or out there, how did they go
[SPEAKER_02]: about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I've got a pretty unique name and
I secured all handles on all social media
[SPEAKER_00]: with my own name right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look for Angela Baca on
Instagram, Twitter, Gmail, it's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got your TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a TikTok.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I got yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm too old for that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you are on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter, Gmail, Facebook, all the... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check out my books at flowervalley
.press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's funny about this is my
publishing company, Flower Valley Press,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a cannabis name, even if people
seem to think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on my hometown Lompoc,
which is the flower seed capital of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call it the Flower Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that name comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also happened to become like a huge
cannabis capital in California very
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, which is part of why I moved
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wild how it just overnight
became this huge thing in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_02]: County, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because the county accepted it so,
you know, in large scale, it was the one
[SPEAKER_02]: place in California you could really
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Barbara County was always going to
become the epicenter of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation in California, whether people
up north liked it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason is because it's 75
and sunny year round and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cut flower greenhouses everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were cut flower greenhouses
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a federal trade pact with
Ecuador and Colombia in the early 2000s
[SPEAKER_00]: that we agreed to buy cut flowers from
Ecuador and Colombia in exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to cut off the flow of cocaine to
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that did was put out all of the
local flower growers in my hometown and
[SPEAKER_00]: southern Santa Barbara County,
northern Santa Barbara County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Prop 64 was on the ballot,
a lot of those greenhouses went up for
[SPEAKER_00]: sale and they got snapped up real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're producing a third of the
legal cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: My hometown, Lompoc, which has been
described by our Congressman Slude Carahal
[SPEAKER_00]: as the armpit of his district,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful place on the coast,
has the most poverty in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed a law after Prop 64 passed in
California where we're like, no rules over
[SPEAKER_00]: the state, no taxes over the state,
no license caps, everything goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lounges, we have rotating scene
of dispensaries with a population of
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the only cannabis testing lab in
the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two of the largest extractors in
the state there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're surrounded by either wineries
and grape farms or cannabis farms all
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some FOMO and moved home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to doing this again soon
with our next book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to take a break before the next book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
