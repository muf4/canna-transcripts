[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to today's episode of the James
lab podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: My special guest is Mosca Rick from Mosca
Negra Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today, Rick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a year since we like,
well, I guess we hung out at spandibus
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spandibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been doing booths together for
the last few years at spandibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend time hanging out, traveling the
world together here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's great to have you on the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess let's get started and talk
about your history and how you came up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it was really,
it's always been a love for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was 13, my relatives who lived
in Iowa showed me these huge 15 foot hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, asking us if we knew what that
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a garbage paper garbage bag full of
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took it home with us back to
Illinois, thinking that this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: potent, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did nothing but give us headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to cure it in mason jars with
apple slices, oranges, and all it did was
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the beginning of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, throughout going to
school in the summers, I worked at an
[SPEAKER_00]: orchid farm near my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where I learned more
about cultivation, growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I traveled to Amherst Amsterdam
back in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, to be able to see people
smoking freely in coffee shops was just an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye-opening experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time for me, my whole goal was
to grow flour as good as I could buy in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And weren't setting your goals too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at that time, that was... So was
this in the 90s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, late 1999 was the first time I
visited Amsterdam.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the greenhouse was one of the first
ones I went to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have a big blown up portrait
of their menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep up on my wall just to remind me
of where it all began.
Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I still have my bobblehead from
Arian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The king of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was great to share space at his
booth this year at Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to say, but I think it was my best
Spannabis ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was more fun than it's been in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we worked our asses off,
I wasn't having to manage multiple seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just you and I hanging out with
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That by itself was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, much more efficient, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see all our old friends from our
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really tremendous to see old
faces and to connect with Mila at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Squash Off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our highlights, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Squash Off was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it before many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first time I judged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been friends with Uncle Stoner
for a long time, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a real character.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a one of a kind, genuine dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very authentic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wears his heart on his sleeve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a really great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a lot of fun being able
to contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken Estes was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to bump into a lot of people I
haven't seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Spannabis, it's just a beautiful
thing, beautiful event for cannabis people
[SPEAKER_01]: coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak highly enough of the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite gathering of friends,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see that number of people and just
having a great time talking, having a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of social aspect, but then also there's a
business aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just a great balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no better city to have it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and the food is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we don't have to worry about
COVID now, so that makes it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple, I was worried a little
bit this year because the year before we
[SPEAKER_01]: had to wear masks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of like, it was a little
bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of people attending wasn't very
high the previous year, but this year it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like COVID didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of people, it just,
it was no holds barred.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tremendous time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back, so you started smoking
early 90s, late 80s?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always smoked through the 80s,
90s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing up in the Midwest,
it's really hard to find good flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all changed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in the day, I mean, it was all
brick, we'd occasionally get some tie
[SPEAKER_00]: stick, but there really wasn't a lot to
choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you transition from doing as a
cultivator into breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when did that occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a long time ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in the early 2000s,
like 2003, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became very good friends with Headed
Slot, who owned Magus Genetics out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had bought seeds from the
Bluebird coffee shop in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the 20 packs that I bought,
the Warlock was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to the High Times Cup like a
year later, and Garrett or Headed had a
[SPEAKER_00]: booth at the High Times Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went up to him, started talking
to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know, you're Holland's
best kept secret because the genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: I found from those seeds were just some of
my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked for four hours straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really my mentor in selection
for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I had smoked the Cinderella 99
seeds that I had, and I really connected
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was I'd love the cerebral high,
but it had like an indica aftertaste to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a roller coaster to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That complexity was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that really motivated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked to Garrett about how can I
keep this in case I lose my mother plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he helped me with selection,
what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took five different families of the
Cinderella 99 that was available at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was back in the Gypsy Nirvana days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bred the different selected plants to
come up with what I ended up calling the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinderella 99 back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was my first project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Garrett told me that Gypsy,
one of his favorite strains was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, if you have so many seeds,
why don't you send them some?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can distribute them out of his
freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, that sounds like a great
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gypsy gave some of those seeds to
Crazy Composer, who used to be the senior
[SPEAKER_00]: editor for High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a blog on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said it was the best example of
pineapple fino of the Cinderella 99 he's
[SPEAKER_00]: ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, everybody wanted
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gypsy said to me, well,
I guess it's time you get your own page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to all of a sudden put a seed
company together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all based on the Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sold out within the first 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started with a bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done projects that included the Old
Time Moonshine, one of DJ Short's
[SPEAKER_00]: short-lived strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stopped working with it because of the
high number of mutations in the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had sourced two packs from some
IC maggers and started working with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and found some male and female keepers and
then did that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started doing projects on my
own based on different strains that I
[SPEAKER_00]: liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a good 17 years ago that I've
been growing professionally now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in Illinois right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is the market over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The market is very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensaries, they keep adding
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers-wise, they're selling hundreds
of millions of dollars a month through
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been fortunate that some of our
strains have been included in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with a company called New
Era, now Legacy IL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've put our Raspberry Boogie into
the dispensaries and then now an
[SPEAKER_00]: unreleased strain called Root Beer Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Mean Genes, Root Beer with
Capulators Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it hazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like everything bred with
that Mac ends up hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is definitely a haze aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this dominance that comes from
that Mac, that Colombian side of good or
[SPEAKER_01]: bad, however you want to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Mac 1 is a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's amazing looking, but it's a
really tough plant to breed with properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all comes down to selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the larger sample size you have,
the more likely that you're going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially with something like that,
where you have something so dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want a larger gene pool to select
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff you don't need 1,000 seeds to
go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need 150.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think over 1,000 is a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's your magic number for
selections?
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to do 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if we've done a run outdoors,
we've done 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you select your parental
stock properly, then you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want out of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample size.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the more you know the line,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at the end of the day,
what people don't understand is the more
[SPEAKER_01]: you breed with stuff, you understand what
the male and what the female or donor,
[SPEAKER_01]: male or donor, and what the female is
contributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, a lot of times, know what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know if you're going to have to
pop 100 seeds, or you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: pop 50 seeds, or you'll probably find what
you're looking for in a smaller amount,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 15 or 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, true, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole phenol hunt is the entire
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it starts from labeling correctly
from when you plant those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're doing three,
four, five strains of 50 each,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to make sure everything is
documented properly, and sometimes more
[SPEAKER_00]: than just one label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a stake and a collar tag?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are on the same page on this one,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so easy to get stuff mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just getting rid of the wrong
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're doing the selection
process, growing them out multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to grow them out once and do my
selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many times do you grow them out?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least two, but preferably three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are you typically looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing your selections?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that with selections,
you have to look for the most ideal plants
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we consider ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it's the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it dries, it has bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have that loud aroma to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the high like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's things like people talk about,
oh, they want a really heavy yielder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not necessarily the best for
quality in today's market, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start doing proper phenol
hunts and working the whole line,
[SPEAKER_00]: lines through a process, you understand
what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't necessarily want to
prioritize quality, not quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, prioritize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think prioritizing quality is the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yield can be down on the list of
things because there's a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: viability aspect of it, especially at
scale when people are growing rooms of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the first thing for me is
always flavor effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, effect is super important too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But flavor speaks highly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor chasers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a flavor chaser.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a flavor chaser.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some projects together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all about chasing flavors at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a variety of flavors too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So jumping into that, what are the flavors
that you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love fruity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love something that's unique and
different, like your Zerios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that brings a lot to the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taste is really something really
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely multiple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the flavors that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like something that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked a joint the other day at this
concert and it was just, it had some hash
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles hash with the Skittles flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was off the hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you should taste that because that
one right there is just the flour and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think you need any hash with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got myself, I'm Fino hunting,
so I need to go through some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got, this is a Zerios ZBX.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the loops and we found some candy ones,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back through them and pretty
good flavor though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the bat, you taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's down to that roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to refire the roach a month
later, you'd probably taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you find flour that tastes like
it smells, that's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you do a lot of Fino hunting as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going through, it's like, there's a
lot of stuff that can be misleading where
[SPEAKER_01]: the nose in the bag is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to smoke it and it's a let
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's all over the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even the look may have great bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the Oreos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oreos has great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks super sexy, but then when it
comes to smoking it, it's like cardboard
[SPEAKER_01]: turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really into those turf profiles
like that, where it does have turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has like this chocolatey funkiness
that I'm not super, you know, I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: impressed by, but I'm not, it's not
something I go, go out and look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, it is really great to define
some good combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I brought some of the flour for you
to, to look at the Zerios Raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: Boogie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, that does hit on all
cylinders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're looking for people know
about the Zerios, but let's talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry Boogie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our collaboration that we've
been working on for, God, we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: working over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've exchanged, yeah, almost two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've exchanged a bunch of genetics and we
share stuff and, you know, and we're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to hang out enough to where we can smoke
stuff together and kind of talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about the Raspberry Boogie
and the history of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Raspberry Boogie, that's the Sour
Raspberry to the Pink 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pink 2.0 is from Mike Exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that is one that I've
worked, the longest on and the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: really has been, you know, our flagship
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our most popular over time and really
has raspberry turps tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the flower has a real deep purple to
a magenta coloration and just very tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she tests in the high twenties,
twenties.
[SPEAKER_00]: 28, 29%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, she's, she's been cultivated,
I think in every single state in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country and worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's, yeah, you've been selling seeds
out for a while over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we met a guy from Norway who
really loved the Raspberry Boogie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was all from like IC Magazine,
you know, cause there's a lot of Europeans
[SPEAKER_00]: that belong to the group and yeah,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you still have your IC Magazine
magazines or did you ever have them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were part of the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back along.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my really good friends,
including totally BJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still see like a true cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Barry, Barry, Barry,
I partied with Barry in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some crazy stories about him and I
and, uh, Dr. Green, uh, which is Marcus
[SPEAKER_01]: from greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the Trinidad episode of strain
hunters, but, uh, yeah, partying with him
[SPEAKER_01]: at voyagers and all over Amsterdam and
good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barry's are really, and he's really into
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's super passionate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran into him at spandibus,
uh, when we were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you, uh, working on right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, um, I just finished,
uh, growing out a lot of offspring of
[SPEAKER_00]: projects I've worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we just released, um, our Mountain
Dew, uh, that has been, um, really well
[SPEAKER_00]: received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Mountain Dew is sour Kush,
uh, to the pink and, uh, gassy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gassy has like this almost lemon lime
aftertaste that resonates on your palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a black lime reserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That like lemony sprite tasting almost
like where it's super lime and you taste
[SPEAKER_01]: the lime, but it's sprite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy, but not Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought some flour for you to try
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working on, uh, the Mountain Dews,
uh, I have some others in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, you know, as a breeder and
developing new cultivars, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that, you know, if you have
like, uh, a strain, uh, that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on, and for example, um,
I've been working on a unicorn poop cross
[SPEAKER_00]: to the pink animal crackers, great bag
appeal, great structure, phenomenal high
[SPEAKER_00]: tour, but she doesn't have, she doesn't
have that loud nose and we've grown out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it smoke loud or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not taste loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the funny thing is, is like for me
personally, like I don't, at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, if it tastes loud and it tastes
amazing, I don't mind if it's not loud in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I want it, I want it to be
cause it's a good selling point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the end of the day, if it's like a
sleeper and nobody knows about it and it
[SPEAKER_01]: smokes amazing, that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if the high is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more like a sleeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I wanted to give her some flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I crossed her to the raspberry boogie
cause she delivers and it comes to that
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, brought some flour for you to
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow really, really, really frosty,
good, delicious flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I've had from you has been that
the raspberry boogie, uh, Zerios was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had seeds in it and I still smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I kept the seeds obviously,
but man, that was some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and it's, it's funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a funky, like, uh, almost sour
raspberry, like sour cherry and raspberry
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor to it, which is really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, a very, uh, thick smoke to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is like a creaminess that,
so the cereal milk in the Zerios with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like Zerbert, which has the Skittle
Sherbert and then that's cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds this nice creaminess to a lot of
the Finos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look at the, the loops that we were
doing, a lot of them, had that bready
[SPEAKER_01]: creaminess that like really it makes it
for a thick smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, uh, third project that I've
been working on, uh, is a collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, uh, BJ, uh, SAWGARMY and that's,
um, working with Pink Zaza and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we've done some crosses with her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that's one of the people you're
visiting here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've been, uh, together for three
days visiting farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to the concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Fox.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold out for like three days.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into some breeding talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as reversals, you know,
we've been chatting on the phone about
[SPEAKER_01]: reversals for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you, uh, you were at a point
where you're struggling and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: worked it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an individual thing for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reversal side, I think it's a lot more
difficult than people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of trial and error
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and each room is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can write an SOP for it,
but that doesn't mean that it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work perfectly the first time in your
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back with everything that you know
now, what would you tell yourself about
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, when you first started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, take the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To, uh, really think through the different
steps of the process because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we as farmers are very busy all the time
because there's 101 things that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you prioritize those and really take
the time, think through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you ensure that each,
each step of, uh, breeding or reversal,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have found, if I look back at my
steps of, you know, either something's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone perfect, you know, better than
expected or a terrible, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not, things are not working properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking notes is one of your big ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely keep a notebook for each room
that you're working on because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I had mentioned that we were
doing four or five reversals at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep them all separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep them all organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we have a 14 light reversal room
here where we were testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a lot of R and D in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, taking notes is essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not using LEDs is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people get great results and
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, uh, light spectrum of choice is HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600, thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single ended, double ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be 600 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the DE's, the HPS I think is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cutting the nutrition by 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, do you find that when you do that,
the plants turn more yellow on the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the plants stress more,
uh, with the HPS and then cutting the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could even cut the PPFD a little
bit, but what you're trying to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: stress the plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, in combination with the silver
and the stress, I use a nano silver that's
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed every other day from about seven
to 10 days before, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar until about seven to 10 days
after, depending on once you start seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, what's, what's your method?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use STS and I use Garrett Slot's
proprietary, uh, method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the four to four to one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's proprietary.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to read my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is proprietary, but I will tell you
that it's very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start like a month before the reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to, uh, spraying up in two weeks into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lighter dose of STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not the four to one maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not stressful on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a very stressful thing
for the plant to reverse its sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so let's not add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I've had distributors,
uh, say like pure sativa that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the seeds produced with that reversal,
there's zero intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never gets it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complaints about our seeds or a
Garrett seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would rather take a longer time
reversing a plant, knowing that the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome is going to be what we want it to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you know, mother nature still does
her thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One out of every 4,000 will be a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have the, if them express
males and yeah, especially if you're field
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, that's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one in a thousand is likely to
express some sort of, uh, male,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, male plant, but you can get full
male expression and it's just very
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar specific or cross specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're dealing with autos,
it's depending on, um, a lot of factors
[SPEAKER_01]: and, but you know, really stable stuff,
it should be like one in a thousand like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's considered stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one in 4,000, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, uh, some books and some of
the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the auto flower varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting like one in a thousand,
that's, that's not too bad, but 15,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you gotta think if you're putting
15,000 of those out per acre, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the beginning, a lot of
guys were just, they just let it do their
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and stuff will get seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, if you have a good trained
staff, you can pull those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you can identify them before
they're an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the ones that are fully
expressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to take the time to be in
there with the plants that really I'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to identify it because they are
walking through the fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of walking, but you know,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, um, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing acres of auto flower just makes me
smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no crappy days there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, proper reversal techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so, so important for breeding
because now everyone, every once one wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow, uh, feminized seeds, uh,
uh, for, you know, the, the different
[SPEAKER_00]: state requirements for how many personal
plants you can have at home growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, would you say that 75% of your
seed sales are feminized and 25% are reg
[SPEAKER_01]: or would you say it's even more?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say mine is probably 90,
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's actually more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still offer a few strains regular
because there are people still looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I offer a lot regular, but as far as what
people buy, people really buy feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, we're like 95% now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, 95, 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll see, you know, the occasional
pink lemonade or, um, um, Mountain Dew
[SPEAKER_01]: other breeders buying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get other breeders and I'm super happy,
you know, to be honest, I'm super happy
[SPEAKER_01]: when other people buy my regs to breed
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some breeders are like, Oh, you should ask
permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy someone's regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ask permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and breed with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed your heart's content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm just happy people are,
uh, you know, buying my genetics and are
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, there's, it's,
you know, it's a personal thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also it's like, we're breeding for
other people and we're breeding for the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed for what I like a lot of times,
but I also am aware of where the market's
[SPEAKER_01]: going and what people like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to have a variety of all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's good because you know,
when you, um, look at the different
[SPEAKER_00]: States, East coast is different than West
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what might be popular,
like a sour diesel in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it might be Skittles something
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got some pith.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pith is a big thing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the PIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PIF is super big.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the black Cuban haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all real popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started here though, by the way,
just so people remember started in Santa
[SPEAKER_01]: Cruz, the haze, you know, haze brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, back in the day, uh, I grew Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, greenhouse seeds and I love
Neville's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the a five, the a five is a
Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the closest thing there is to
cat piss without being cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was straight ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't have the skunk behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that she's, she's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run her, uh, many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, so, yeah, so depending on,
you know, what's popular or what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for, um, you know, Oklahoma,
whatever, um, then it's good to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: variety because somebody wants it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and I think as breeders,
we, we want to make sure we're giving
[SPEAKER_00]: people a good selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, giving people
options, you know, cause we want variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people to breed variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but the funny thing is,
you know, in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like in Europe, they went towards
everything haze before haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot more variety there too,
but we bottleneck because we get so
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the hype and then,
you know, these exotic strains now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, everyone's jumped on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to have gelato and really there's so
much other stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a ton of other stuff,
you know, going through like, like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing with our project with the
raspberry boogie Zerios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So totally different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the beauty of a good
collaboration is you're going to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that's, um, you know,
from the best from both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a piece of piece of two different
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put together to make something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think breeding with intention is so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a lot of time overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I just crossed this with
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I believe in intentional breeding and
the, the stuff we do together,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's intentional breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're purposely crossing these things
together with the intent of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's somewhere in the middle
that has something that's part of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some, some good contributing
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the raspberry boogie has got a lot of
Terps Zerios has a lot of Terps,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, together you're getting stuff
that's real Terpy, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry, then you get creamy candy from
the Zerios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it's, it's just a good
complex thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeding with intent like that,
you're going to improve the gene pool
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than either, you know, stay the
same or bring it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's constant improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little constant things that where
we're improving and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do something good and it could be
around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we all know a whole bunch that are
like that, but you know, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing is, you know,
like an AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it always has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mentioned on the last show too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the cherry was the one before.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the AK 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cherry, not the original AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, which is, we'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get Simon on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a real true F1 breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think he was, he was a biology
teacher, wasn't he?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's always good to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fan of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite old school strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have an original mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's a true Cinderella pineapple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can people find out more about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, your website, let's talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Instagram, uh, uh, our moniker name is,
uh, Mosca seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Mosca seeds and our website is Mosca
seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we have a lot of information
on our site and, um, it's actually one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the top 10 in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also have another collaboration that
we've done that you can find those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: on your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the James loud Mosca
collaborations, go to Mosca seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on Instagram at Mosca seeds,
not Mosca dash seeds, not mosque.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a bunch of fake accounts?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get them to take them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's like five different
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't type in Mosca seeds
perfectly, like you'll get the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was a pleasure having you on the
show today, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to do this again sometime soon
when we announce our next collaboration,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to do some zoom style podcasts
in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be great to come out and check out
your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming on the show and we'll
talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
