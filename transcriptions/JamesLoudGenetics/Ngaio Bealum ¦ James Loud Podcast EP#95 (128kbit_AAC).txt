I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, our special guest is Ungayo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ungayo, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ungayo Bielam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's an actor.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: A writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Among other things, he's a writer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows Angela Baca, my editor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, he knows a lot of my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done editing for your editor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to run a magazine back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which magazine?
[SPEAKER_03]: West Coast Cannabis Magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Hara Lee, who did all the
layouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hara Lee did the layout of my book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hara Lee is a beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And shout out to my boy, Mike,
who was the salesman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's also a monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a monster.
He's a monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taking cannabis ads back then,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was space.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked Richard Lee into giving me
some money to start a magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of Richard Lee,
I just did a Oaksterdam class today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was on Oaksterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught a three hour class on
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say you can take a horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you can take a horse to water as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can totally take a horse to water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take a horse to water,
but a pencil must be led.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep moving on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I taught a class at Oaksterdam today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: On horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: On horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, pheno hunting or just the general?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, me, I like to go off topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, we went into pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy talking about what I enjoy talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The class was really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of people from an Indian
reservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had people from all over the Canary
Islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Columbia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 40 people in the class.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Oaksterdam because it used to be a
very in-person thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's basically open to everyone
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's great having people excited
about cannabis all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in this beautiful time in a
lot of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked about it in my class today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's scary for some
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are very upset about the way
things are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's always been that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for cannabis, not as many people are
going to prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we just got a whole bunch of
pardons for cannabis prisoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing that's happened in the last
year was that a lot of, well, just
[SPEAKER_02]: recently, not in the last year,
in the last week, we have people getting
[SPEAKER_02]: out of prison for cannabis crimes that
they never should have been put in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one should ever go to jail for weed
anywhere in the world.
Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never, ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed is a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very useful plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still one of those old school,
Jack Hare, hemp can save the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We all should be taking advantage of this
beautiful and glorious plant, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: just so much for humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not to get all woo-woo about it,
but for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis can make the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it's impossible to argue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has in my life, in your life,
and so many other people around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made their world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it has the, you know,
the power to change people's minds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is one of the reasons they try to
keep it illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you get stoned and you start
noticing shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're like, we got to change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's wrong here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something's terribly, horribly wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think cannabis tunes you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcohol tunes you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like cannabis better than
alcohol, even though I don't mind alcohol,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever I don't judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a full bar over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed some nice tequilas, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some great tequilas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some great whiskeys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some, a venom over there that's got
a Cobra and a scorpion in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the James allowed podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to have something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mariachi band might show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would have ordered it, we would
have got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep that in mind for the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we're going to do a
cooking show later on this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to do a cooking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your go-to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're invited to the potluck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring it something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you don't want to spend a million
days doing it, but you want to bring
[SPEAKER_03]: something that showcases your ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, my family, we are all good cooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you go to the family reunion,
they will put your name on the dish that
[SPEAKER_03]: you brought, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For accountability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can't be like, who made the potato
salad?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know damn well that Aisha made the
potato salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't eat that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She makes a great potato salad.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can all cook, so nobody's afraid to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is accountability.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't say, no, I didn't make that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I mean, I'm French trained.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a background in culinary arts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bachelor's degree in culinary
arts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Associates, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Associates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to food, I like making
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do fruity pebble treats is one of my
desserts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you bring a fruity pebble treat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smash burgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring smash burgers to the potluck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bring pizza and I make pizzas to order.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a wood fire pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just show up with your wood fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have a pizza oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a rock box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will come over with a pizza oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make the dough one day in a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm inviting you to all my potlucks now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I go above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smash burgers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love perfecting things, but I also like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just fry some chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also do Korean fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made Korean fried chicken yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Koreans learn that from the black people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: During the Korean War.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the Colonel, I swear.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Colonel didn't have much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you know Colonel Jenkins is a black
guy stationed in Korea during the war,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not Colonel Sanders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely not Colonel Sanders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love fried chicken too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love extra crispy fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now do you brine your chicken?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buttermilk it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great way to do it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that like yesterday,
basically I did, I used cornstarch,
[SPEAKER_02]: egg, cornstarch, egg, cornstarch,
and then I fried it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically you do twice fried.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you fry it once, you get a little
crispy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right before you eat it,
you throw it in again to crisp it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's extra crispy and you can do them
in strips.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do breast strips if you want to
go a little healthier or you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chicken wings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicken wings, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll eat chicken wings 18 million
different ways, but I'm a, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe start an argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not always a fan of a brine because I
think it makes everything too salty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we over salt everything
and I don't want, I don't always want like
[SPEAKER_03]: salt to be the first flavor or the
overwhelming flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a spice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a little salt on the skin and then
you get a little saltiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the chicken starts to chicken it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was a Chez Panisse for nine months,
a long, long time, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a Chez Panisse 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on Evening at the Improv in 1993,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chez Panisse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is very, very important to our
conversation because I learned at Chez
[SPEAKER_02]: Panisse that you use things like salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use things like sauces to elevate the
raw ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salt and sugar forward in a lot of
American cuisine these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the fat and the umami,
they want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a lot of fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love good butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you love it deep fried?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not picky when it comes to,
I mean, I'm picky with quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm not picky about different things
because I feel like there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways to prepare stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: To make butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were talking about oxtail
earlier, I love oxtail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if you don't like oxtail,
but you like braised meat, you probably
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't had good oxtail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't had the good oxtail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I used to have to- How do you like
a braised meat and not like an oxtail?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some people don't like the name
oxtail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, listen, poor people have always made
the best food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a damn shame that the rich people
have discovered the tail of the cow
[SPEAKER_03]: because now it's $12 a pound or whatever
when it used to be the cheap cut of meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you had to learn how to do
something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, tri-tip was like that back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different cuts of meat
that were really cheap and then people
[SPEAKER_02]: figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, terris major is a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the petite filet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're calling it petite
filet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep calling it terris major.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different cuts,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That were like the butcher's steak,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They called it the butcher's steak because
they couldn't sell it, so the butchers
[SPEAKER_02]: would take it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would keep it, learn how to do
something with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it always goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I got some chicken bones and you got an
onion, we're going to make soup as a team.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stone soup is a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone soup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my favorite books as a
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been a fan of that philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we got off topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where were we?
[SPEAKER_02]: We totally got off topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me about yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm six foot three inches tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an Aquarius or you're the monkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the monkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragons and monkeys get along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a ride though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was February 16th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm February 15th.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right around champs, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: The funniest thing is I get along really
good with people that were born around my
[SPEAKER_02]: birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Us Aquarius's get along with other
Aquarius's that are born around that same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Platonically, we can't always date.
[SPEAKER_03]: But platonically, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one of us could be unemotional and
flighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, you do comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we were at 420 together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've known about you for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In San Francisco, we were at 420 together
last year, 2024.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were the MC for the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a really sad day.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Dave passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed away that morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was such a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: To celebrate, did Dave like weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: To celebrate, he loved weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave got me breeding for effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been breeding for flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being a chef, you can't blame someone for
breeding for flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, flavor and effect, they kind of go
hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you think about different terpenes
have different effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the different smell will give you
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there needs to be more of a
focus back on effect for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about this flavor stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's go down to the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it make you feel amazing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all these different cultivars,
all these different cultures, cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have, they give you a different
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of them is slightly different,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that no two are exactly the same,
because a lot of them are similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some that are special,
that make you feel a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our body chemistry is so unique that
what works for me may not work for you or
[SPEAKER_02]: the next guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell people that all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to find a buttender who smokes
like you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you've just got to try a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you learn what you like is by
trying everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go back to the stuff you
really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends who keep notebooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take detailed notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's an app for that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the Buddhist app?
[SPEAKER_03]: I should actually take more advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes I'm just stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to write shit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, that was good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the jar test, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a bunch of jars, which one do
you go back to?
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that doesn't have a lot left.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that makes you feel a certain way,
the one that tastes the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Skittles for the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also when it's grown in soil,
I love the way it makes me feel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And White Thorn Rose is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really good, is that what's right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Johnny, big shout out to- Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huckleberry Hill Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the few weeds I actually
buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really buy weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much the only gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy rosin gummies with White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes you feel great, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The effects, the flavor, the vibe,
it's just super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, I also like a really, which I
haven't seen in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's still growing it,
but Chocolate Hashberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sticky Fields is growing that out there in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that one in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate Hashberry is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it in like five,
six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody's got any Chocolate Hashberry,
call me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come over.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that one in a long time
either.
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time you saw champagne?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, pink champagne, yes,
but the old school champagne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat Piss and Champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Campelli, big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But smell this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my new White Thorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is EDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smoke some.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way more on the peach side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, but you smoke it and it's
straight floral down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes floral and I feel like it gives
you a similar effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Blue 13 from Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: who passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the blueberry haze times Kevin
Jodry's, Louis the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the huckleberry hill, white thorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I don't even know the genetics on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just assumed it was some sort of
forbidden fruit variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure, but it's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even try to ask because they'll
just stare at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm actually gifting this to
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sharing it with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to grow it here in house,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in house here, but with our
cultivation partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only people that are going to have is
my cultivation partners in the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is SF Kana, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this called again?
[SPEAKER_02]: ZDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: ZDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: You done with ZDP?
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that's tried this really enjoys
the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bubbler here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a chem-dog bubbler.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a two-hit kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite bubbler.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a bunch of little millies that have
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing millies in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a dancing bear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steal your face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steal your face right off of your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take, you're from the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you love Grateful Dead too,
I take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how can you not love Grateful
Dead?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you not love the Grateful Dead?
[SPEAKER_03]: They speak to me on an emotional level.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever done psychedelics and
smoked a bunch of weed, how can you not
[SPEAKER_02]: like the Grateful Dead?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can get a little noodly sometimes,
but I like a noodle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a problem for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the noodle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the noodling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the pizza tapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're deep into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about noodling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I love the old Jerry stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like early 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a hard drive right over
here with every recording of the Grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of dat stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel from like maybe 1975, maybe 1978,
they may have been the best band in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now from say 86 to 93, Fishbone was the
best band in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Fishbone too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't even know about
Fishbone.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you not know about Fishbone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you like the Grateful Dead,
you should like Fishbone because they get
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get down in a very American,
groovy, everybody's locked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're creating a higher consciousness sort
of way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least when they were at their peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in 80s was kind of rough with music,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was a lot of electronic
stuff coming in that maybe doesn't appeal
[SPEAKER_02]: to people today, but there was still some
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, listen, there was all that punk
rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were leaning into the industrial.
[SPEAKER_03]: House was kind of just getting creative
right after the Donna Center thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people starting to figure it out
in Detroit and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early days of San Francisco, House,
early 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then House blew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, being from San Francisco,
if you didn't go to raves in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really missed out on some amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like disco, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raves are kind of, they're kind of an
offshoot of the disco, but more,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, crazier.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's the city though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you DJ too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was never a DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you play guitar?
[SPEAKER_03]: I play guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I play guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we should have brought our
instruments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time I'll bring a conga drummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just sit here and hippie out for
three hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we get a little drum circle going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time we're eating mushrooms,
we're getting a drum circle going 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very tasty and clearly it
makes me chatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like, I like the effects of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a good hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just starting to kick in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel the uplift for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel a little behind the eyes a little
bit of the flavor is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, floral notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot more peats than just like
straight tropical fruit, but that could
[SPEAKER_03]: just be me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I'm on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it Peachthorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to see
Johnny next week and we're going to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I feel like, yeah, it's,
it's got a special look to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, it's kind of like Skittles in the sense
that it's not super beautiful as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: the structure, but I think the effect way
outweighs the, the bag of peel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks, and you know, listen,
we, it's so hard now that they don't serve
[SPEAKER_03]: deli style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you know, you're,
it's sitting in mylar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the conditions are hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this, it's that it's not moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not always maintaining the terpenes
like you like and all it takes three
[SPEAKER_03]: months to get the approval.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it starts to degrade after a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to trust the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to trust the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can't, you know, I mean,
smell, smell the bag or at least look at
[SPEAKER_03]: it and be like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst part about recreational
cannabis is that we lost the deli style
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can't actually smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is some old school funk right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely smell the funk and it's like
some skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so that's the crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it before?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very much an old school OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows like a sativa though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's got that morphology where
it's like really bad node spacing,
[SPEAKER_02]: thinner leaves, taller plants,
but it has that classic OG structure and
[SPEAKER_02]: it has that really classic nose burning
OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm also smelling a little,
uh, like a little creaminess, almost like
[SPEAKER_03]: an old school Northern lights or something
like that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanilla Luna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is just an old school cut from
Florida called the Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that be late nineties, early two
thousands?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe even a little bit before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just, we got the cut recently,
um, in the last couple of years and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sticky like to where you can stick
that bud to the microphone stand and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally if you thumb it over there,
you thumb it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to ruin this bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can thumb it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you when was the last time you
thumbed the bud to something and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love that surface tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for adhesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adhesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not related to Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adhesion.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole different conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this stuff is super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it called again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just straight old school Crippie stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just old school Crippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think old school is making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Diesel, OG Kroff, Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are going to be making a
comeback this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing about Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream will never, at least to me,
Blue Dream will never go away because what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens is you smoke a lot of Blue Dream
and then you're like, man, I got to give
[SPEAKER_03]: other weeds a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lay off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you found a Blue Dream that
wasn't great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, oh, I need a Blue Dream
tolerance break or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you smoke a really good one
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, God, that's my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I ever stop?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good for a variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch a movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do stuff or not do stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream is so well balanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so well balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such an interesting variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Crack on the, I like Green Crack
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, but Green Crack,
I hate the name too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the worst name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a green.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, the reason it's called
Green Crack is because you smoke it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets you so high, but you build a
tolerance to it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like within a week, it doesn't get you
high anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally I would smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I didn't realize that was the
origin of the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is like, if I only,
I did this one time where I only grew
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after a week, my tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were literally a Green Crack head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, so I'd get my friends
over smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be like, oh, this is so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd smoke big joints with them and I
wouldn't be fazed and they would be
[SPEAKER_02]: completely out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at a, this is 2012 at the parade
for the giants in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought big joints of Green Crack to
smoke with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I passed one of my friends,
Joe, and we were out in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: library.
[SPEAKER_03]: One man crowd control committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in front of the library in San
Francisco and he took a couple of hits
[SPEAKER_02]: from it and had to actually sit down on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what are you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we just took a couple of hits and
he's like, this is the strongest weed I
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be careful with the amateur
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've definitely killed a party or two with
a regular size joint, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wasn't even an amateur.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just different than what he's used to
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I was in New York just before New
Year's and we went to a couple of spots
[SPEAKER_03]: and a friend of mine knew this gray area,
half legal spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd been around for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a smoking lounge and a little weed
room, but you couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to, you know, walk up the steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't know what you're looking for or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: No sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't even tell you where it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just kind of following them around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, oh, we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the way back, I was trying to
go, okay, don't forget where you were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, I'm too high to
fucking try to remember what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great way to lose your car too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've wandered neighborhoods because I get
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I have a rental car,
so I forget what it is or what it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then got stoned at the park or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up walking three miles in the
wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even opened this yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about strains making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I have super silver haze in the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Spain, they grow so many hazes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the amnesia, the super silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love a haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a patience thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The commercial growers don't always have
the patience to go 12 weeks, 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small batch, long flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's O for two, but a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ariane from greenhouse came to a Terp Nami
in San Francisco, David Downs event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing this year, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out David Downs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out David.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up weed week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hash week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love weed week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hash week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Terp Nami.
[SPEAKER_02]: David Downs is killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch out 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to drop it even harder this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him, Jimmy Devine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing great events right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love these boutique feeling events
where they put so much energy and love
[SPEAKER_02]: into them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not about the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a good event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the small scale event
producers who love good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Tony Bowles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out my boy Nathan, who does the
Missouri Grower's Cup and the Oregon
[SPEAKER_03]: Grower's Cup and the Arizona Grower's Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canifest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Canifest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out my home girl Sage, who does all
kinds of weed events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggae on the River was a comeback this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to come this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was with an amazing group of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big up the International Cannabis Business
Conference Series, Berlin and Barcelona
[SPEAKER_03]: this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Alex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like genetics, if you like seeds,
Spannibus is really like, if you could
[SPEAKER_03]: only go to one conference or one festival,
it should be Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Mary Jane was better than
Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary Jane was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go last year, but I missed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I went two years ago because it
depends on when the International Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Business Conference is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm in Berlin while it's happening,
I can get to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't always afford to stick around
two extra weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't open it, but I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll open it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I said, it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So circling back to hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Arian came here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was at Turpnami and he's shaking his
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what's wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I'm just blown away by all
these hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: All these guys coming down from the hills
got haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was more haze at Turpnami than I've
ever seen at any American event.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was more hazes than they have at
Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was different style hazes from
all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was really Turpinolene dominant
hazes where that Turpinolene Limoni
[SPEAKER_03]: classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpinolene is becoming very popular.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Turpinolene is very popular,
but we had all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like some Durbins.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some Red Congo, which is like
one of my favorites, my all time favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Durbin will get your heart racing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll kick you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll kick you in the chest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Years ago, a friend of mine had crossed
like a land race time high Sativa with,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a heart racer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really tasty weed, but I definitely
had to learn to use its powers for good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people would come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a jar and they'd smell it and be
like, let's smoke that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You came over to hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 20 minutes after you smoke it,
you're going to get up and go do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, man, I got time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just came to kick it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we smoked the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 20 minutes later, they're like,
oh, man, I was supposed to go to the mail,
[SPEAKER_03]: the post office.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go pay this bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: My bathroom's a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just get up and run out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just go start doing shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't, I found it, at least that
one wasn't not like, some of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get that anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, well, if I don't do
something, I'm going to have a heart
[SPEAKER_03]: attack.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was just more like a motivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I really, I just got to get up and do
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the heart palpitations a little bit
from Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get Malawi times Oaxacan right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so international.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love, it's like salsa music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like my varieties, but that is
my like go to when I want to get lifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get lifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be focused, lifted caffeine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm drinking this, uh, this new coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mushroom coffee called rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it coffee with mushrooms in it,
or is it just all mushroom coffee?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a rabbica coffee in it and it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes me super focused where I
taught my class today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drank some of that and I felt fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a lion's mane and coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has like five different mushrooms,
five different mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it, it definitely makes you more
focused without giving you that heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: caffeine buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like caffeine by itself,
but man, I think caffeine with mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: is this key.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not psychedelic mushrooms,
but it's just, it's the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the umami.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushrooms are heavy in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all those kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a bad mushroom out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some will kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so those kinds of mushrooms,
I don't like, but I'm sure they're
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial for the planet and the
environment and other different ways,
[SPEAKER_03]: but maybe you shouldn't kill it or eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's some, you definitely
shouldn't eat more than a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't eat your mushrooms before
you get into them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all the mushrooms that you can eat
that I've eaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I love all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never had a bad mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never ate one mushroom and went like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about it on the show a little bit,
but I do like golden teachers for the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're not super introspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I like the introspective,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes I like just feeling good and
laughing with my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing with golden teachers is you
can eat so many of them and still have an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like you go penis heavy and you
eat too much of those and you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back for a while and you're not
wanting to eat mushrooms for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I borrow your scissors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we had scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I got to ask somebody for
scissors and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you look around, become aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't open this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you did have scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're a team.
[SPEAKER_03]: You brought the scissors and I noticed
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to make this as like,
it's like ASMR right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not annoying if it's intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think there's something for
everybody with cannabis and with mushrooms
[SPEAKER_02]: and our body chemistries are so uniquely
different than with, with these mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like some people, the new blue
magnolias, those are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done mushrooms in about a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go through phases.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know all the, all the hip
new.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny that there's like mushroom
heads now, like mushroom chronic sugars,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to combine a golden teacher with a
like 10%, 10%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I micro dose three days a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I macro dose every other week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put cactus in there a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, this is, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make an aloe vera dark chocolate
mushroom smoothie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really, it really cleans me out
spiritually and physically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the spectrum of psychedelics
is so broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we were kids, it was like,
Oh, you want to eat some mushrooms or take
[SPEAKER_02]: some acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to Golden Gate park,
pick up some acid, you know, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: but now it's like, Oh, what do you want to
try?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to micro dose this, this,
this, this, or this, or 10 other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's nice to have a choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to, that you can be aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can complicate things and paralysis
of options.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also nice to be like,
yeah, I'm going to go to a concert and I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do some dancing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll take some golden teachers where
it's not, you know, it's not a little
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to sit there in the corner
thinking about choices that I made,
[SPEAKER_03]: missing my friends, laughing and crying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not rethinking your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a time and a place for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe, you know, the giant rave with
15 of your friends who don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: babysit your high ass is not the time for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I go on road trips sometimes where
I take a big dab before I go and I start
[SPEAKER_02]: rethinking my life on the way there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may or may not have had an existential
moment on a Greyhound bus in the middle of
[SPEAKER_03]: the night because the cookie was way too
strong for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just sitting there thinking about
all these things and you're on a
[SPEAKER_03]: Greyhound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can't really turn to the stranger
or the bus driver and be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey man, I'm really high right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we, can we just stop for a minute?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get snacks?
[SPEAKER_03]: I need black pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can use some sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I just opened it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it may have been sitting
around for a while, but based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smell some ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a different, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a different super silver haze,
but I smoked it before I could bring it
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really super silver hazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just glad it's making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that one might be exciting when
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can still be friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things in my bag though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, don't get it twisted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in fact, I feel like all that buildup,
we had to borrow scissors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to cut the thing open five
different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still going to smell this one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a blind tasting with you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like black pepper, the beta
carilophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really smell osmium, but I feel
like it would be in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, this is grown in a specific
substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this one is grown into different
substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same strain, same exact cultivar from the
same exact mom grown side-by-side with the
[SPEAKER_02]: one in this jar with a different
substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I get to know the strain at first?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I just have to guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smoke these and you're
going to know the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Bubba Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, I really love Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: 398 Bubba, baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where to find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wish I did because I may and I will
look.
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be some seeds in my
refrigerator, but I cannot vouch for
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody's viability or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have some, I'll break some off and
let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the seeds, it's going to be a
different genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really missed that pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenotype, genotype, it's going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be slightly different expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-98 Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love old school pre-98 soapy Bubba where
you smoke it and it's like soapy and gassy
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just coats your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my jam.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's my headband coming back?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crockett gave the 707 headband cut to
Conception and they're going to be selling
[SPEAKER_02]: clones of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be seeing headband
really soon if you like that 707.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's so many different types of
headband out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try the other ones and then then you can
make your decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not a gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's not a gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's the, it's the genetic that I talk
about the most on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably I got this infatuation with this
candy variety and all our watchers know
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever it is, it's tasty as fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I can't, I'm sure what you're saying
will be like, Oh fucking duh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go through all three of the
jars and maybe by the end you'll be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty It's not a cherry cherry pie
or a cherry cushion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's too much gas involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's not spicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like turpogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that name?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're famous for.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about third gen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they're famous for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should really pay more attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should pay more attention to weed
gossip, but also I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really here to argue about who had
and I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like dog, it's your legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you worked for generations and
years to perfect this one strain and then
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody wants to get it and everybody
says they had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody says they started first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you're going to get fired up
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes to me, and this is just my
little hippie ass showing cannabis like
[SPEAKER_03]: juggling is open source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course somebody's going to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to, you know,
there could be parallel evolutions or
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody you never know how these things
come about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love them all and I'm a fan of all
the styles, but it's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough to be proprietary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the cannabis plant itself
does not like people who are too
[SPEAKER_03]: proprietary about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you end up with the fucking
Cavendish banana, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: extinct pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only one we're really growing in
any sort of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe in sharing, but I also
believe in being a steward of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and giving it to the right people and not
to the wrong people.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there, there's, there's so many
different options these days and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: give it to the wrong person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, genetics can go in the,
get in the wrong hands, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also believe that sharing is caring
and sharing good genetics that everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: deserves access to quality flower,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quality genetics that goes,
yeah, I sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell, we have different price seeds for
everybody, but we have something for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody at every price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and we're about to start
selling clones online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a beautiful, beautiful
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's a more of a darker,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a skunkier, gassier sort of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one kind of the same soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, why don't one of them soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's got, are you sure there's
no diesel in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's got that diesel mouthfeel
where, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're a little coded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which candy is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to tell me, you're going to
tell me and I'm just going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'd probably be easier if you smoked in a
joint because down to the road should
[SPEAKER_02]: taste like candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You exhale candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's starts with Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ends with Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't, it's yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think of Skittles as a little
more runcy yummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more deep skunk in it some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and the beauty of Skittles is you
can harvest on day 51 to day 53 and you
[SPEAKER_02]: get one expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: You harvest on day 63, you get another
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this was probably harvested
somewhere in the middle of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like day 56.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get a little bit of that gas
skunky.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was so much like gas coating,
mouth coating in this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I like them both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really pick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think there's one more that's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that door number two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Door number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not going to be as excited
about this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be as excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another one, but, and it smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smell good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smell skittly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got all that pepper, pepper and
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and when you harvest Skittle at the
right time, when you harvest that
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar, you get a lot of melon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get this cantaloupe nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just call me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you called me cantaloupe
nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we were going to have a problem.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows cantaloupe like cantaloupe
nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cantaloupe nose knows cantaloupe nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love good cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong with cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cantaloupe is one of the best.
Big as a melon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That melon, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing, honeydew, like ripe honeydew.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one smells good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why you're fucking down on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the effect, you know, so one of them
is grown in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is grown in soil and another
one grown in living soil.
So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, we're always A-B testing
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is an adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're always looking for that new
adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Life is an adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it is nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do, you do stand up comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do stand up comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be at the Crest theater in Sacramento
this Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tickets are actually free because it was a
last minute show.
[SPEAKER_03]: My boy called me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, Hey, we had an emergency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fallout coming to a show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love stand up comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are just so many great comedians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig Conant is a, one of my new
favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked with him at the Crest last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to get him on my show
someday.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, it was me, him and Steph
Tollef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going on tour right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he'll be in LA February 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am like a fan fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the tour dates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your t-shirt?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a Craig Conant t-shirt?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a tattoo actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have his picture on the mirror in my
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say good morning to him every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's, he's big into psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love his psychedelic jokes because they
resonate with people that do psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you smoke weed or you do
psychedelics, you can relate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: My target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My demographic is a 40 to 55 year old
males that smoke weed and do psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine is a smart people who smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get laid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever works for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some overlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to do some overlap in our
demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to do standup comedy
someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just, I'd love watching standup
comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's so amazing when you see
these comedians, they can tell a story and
[SPEAKER_02]: then circle back at the end and wrap it
all up nice and close it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, wow, these guys are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like learning to make a souffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can, you can learn a souffle
pretty quick, but to get it super right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get it super right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or to scramble an egg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cooking in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any sort of skillset like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like my podcast today.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many years have you been doing it now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did 42 episodes on the cannabis
future project.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Future cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did 42 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Future cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're on episode 90 something
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've done over a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel so much more confident doing
podcasts now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love doing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, what I realized is podcasts are all
about the guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about the host.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how can you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love elevating my guests though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's all about highlighting
your guests and what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely elevated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, and it's probably cumulative
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that third one seemed to kick
everything else into overdrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you lined it up like
that specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put DMT in the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny if we did,
but we would never do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be until you started seeing
little elves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't secretly dose your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have a funeral to go to later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I gotta go to court.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elf sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, so cannabis,
cannabis, cannabis, it's just an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're an amazing time with
legalization, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All these other States going online and
other countries and other countries,
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany, Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be in Germany for the
international cannabis business conference
[SPEAKER_03]: in late April.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like April, April.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around 427.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right after 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually, I got to come back to the
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do some 420 out here and then
I'm going to go back because I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona and I come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be in LA for 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a big seed drop with the
cannabis brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've basically Fino hunted some of my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're forming the big Voltron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do this little limited release.
[SPEAKER_02]: A seed drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: First I imagine you guys just,
you know, in a helicopter, just dropping
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop seeds, not bombs.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Past joints, not judgment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, but then I realized it's like a
shoe drop or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are selling the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the WKRP Turkey drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought weed seeds could fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sharing the seeds with the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I do my share of giving
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I wasn't, uh, I wasn't casting
aspersions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just high and visualizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just taking shit literally as
stoners do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you're entertaining a room full
of stoners, cause you know, I've done
[SPEAKER_03]: dispense reason shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be kind of challenging because they
will take everything literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if a comic goes, yeah, me and my
girlfriend just broke up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, no, we break up every time I
do this bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been broken up for years,
but this bit is still good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't worry, you know, but it's,
it's, it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I forgot what I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about, I was talking
about cannabis and in Germany and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a seed drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to talk about you and how you
got involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you get your start?
[SPEAKER_03]: I started smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I tried one time when I was 12,
but my parents caught me and they,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once when I was like 11, uh, the
counselors at the summer camp,
[SPEAKER_03]: let me hang out and smoke a joint with
them on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then not again to like, I think it was
fifth or sixth grade and then me and Alex
[SPEAKER_03]: Studer.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it might've been eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and Alex Studer used to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, one time my mom called us
and, uh, so she gave me a lecture and then
[SPEAKER_03]: she called my dad, which this,
I knew it was serious because my mom and
[SPEAKER_03]: my dad didn't really get along.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if she called my dad about something,
it was real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my dad, who was a big possible,
it was like, you just gotta wait till
[SPEAKER_03]: college, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, uh, don't get into it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your brain is still forming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got, you got responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then as soon as I got to college,
it's like, yeah, I could try.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you did listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids are the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on them since they were like
five, no drugs till college, no drugs till
[SPEAKER_03]: college.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're adults and they're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they like to smoke a little weed
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: My son's always like, dog, you and your
friends smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just wanted to, hey, you guys get
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was on a cooking show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, yeah, so that's how it
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just started smoking weed in college
and I was like, I really like this weed
[SPEAKER_03]: and I come from a long line of activists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I started like, you know,
looking into it and reading about activism
[SPEAKER_03]: of it and the history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Jack Harris book came out a
little around there in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had met, um, Debbie Goldsberry and Don
from the cannabis action network from back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, man, I'm here for
this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause to me, cannabis legalization does a
lot of things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it helps cops be less racist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they can't just pull you over for
weed or they can't use it as a pretext to
[SPEAKER_03]: pull you over for weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps people out of jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, cause I always smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, always, always, always.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my cologne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always when I'm in the coffee shop
smelling like weed and the cops walk in
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't have to trip, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was smoking a joint in downtown
Sacramento one time and it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't very crowded.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like me, a couple other people on
the street and I was smoking a joint
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting for the bus and three sheriff's
deputies walking by, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just smoking a joint and they're
like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the other ways they set up the
system in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a fan, but just that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great for the blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I heard Dallas, anything less than
four ounces, they will not arrest you for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll get fined, but they are not
arresting people anymore in Dallas,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Dallas, in Dallas, not Austin,
not San Antonio.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no Dallas.
Dallas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, my family lives in Dallas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've never been to Dallas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to Corpus Christi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to San Antonio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to oil town or oil Dale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to El Paso.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to all kinds of towns.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is never Houston.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Houston's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Austin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Viet Cajun food in Houston.
[SPEAKER_03]: The food's great there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Houston is a good eating town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with Austin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Austin, barbecue in Texas is next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, listen, when I'm in Austin or Texas,
it is a struggle to maintain any sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetable because I just eat brisket.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have a brisket taco for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have brisket at lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brisket and eggs, brisket sandwich for
lunch, brisket plate for dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you mucking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get brisket that good
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your odds are very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever they got the brisket,
your odds are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll get a queso with brisket in it
for the appetizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's so funny because Texas has some
barbecue spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are super expensive that you have to
wait in line forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also like the hole in the wall
place that not a lot of people know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's $10 still.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those towns where,
you know, if you're going to put your name
[SPEAKER_03]: on some brisket, you better come correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love brisket with some white
bread and a side of beans and whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even need beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I need a pound of brisket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just brisket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want any sides?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to get in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in most of the places,
the cheap ones, the sides aren't even that
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find one thing that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not taking the risk, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hand over the meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Run me the meat and no one gets hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you like the fatty part of the
brisket?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like the point or do you like the
flap?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like burn ends?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you lean toward the fatty, burn ends is
my go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always a burn end.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's burn ends on the menu,
just hand me the burn ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: One pound of burn ends, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: One pound of burn ends and a good sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not always a fan of the Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a Kansas city style sauce,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I grew up in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had like a little more vinegar,
a little thinner, a little less vinegar,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more corn syrup, a little
thicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, with a little thicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these Texas sauces are some of
those North Carolina guys with mustard and
[SPEAKER_03]: too vinegary.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I don't like the vinegary stuff
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, listen, uh, you could almost say
that, uh, burnt ends with a hot sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: barbecue sauce is like the general chose
chicken, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put a, put a sweet, sauce on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, good hunk of meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans love that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans love a little crispy on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Americans love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the sweet and sour pork of
people who don't eat sweet and sour pork.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way to go though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love ketchup is the soy sauce of
America according to my daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no, my nephew, he used to eat
ketchup packets for food.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heinz ketchup packets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess if that's your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was his ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never liked ketchup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a homemade ketchup, if somebody
made the ketchup, I will, I will take a
[SPEAKER_02]: dab or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's homemade, if you, if you make,
if it's a homemade ketchup, if it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: homemade ranch dressing, you don't need 57
different types of tomato in your ketchup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you don't need any of that weird
vinegar, corn syrup, concoction that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, an excuse to put sugar on your
meat, uh, that they call ketchup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't like ketchup on your steak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nor on my eggs, nor on my baloney
sandwiches, nor on my burgers,
[SPEAKER_03]: nor on my fish or my potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the potatoes, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a big one in America is
don't like ketchup with potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dutch put mayonnaise on their
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who are we to talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch mayonnaise is different too though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like Japanese and I like Dutch
mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch mayonnaise sounds like either a
wrestler or a sex move.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's his signature move is the Dutch
mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they call him Dutch mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta watch out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue waffle in the Dutch mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dutch mayonnaise off the top rope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just said, damn, you know,
cause the Dutch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like eggs a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working on egg salad sandwiches,
Japanese style, Korean style, all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a spot in Sacramento called
Penises.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're mostly Italian, but they put a
little curry powder in the egg salad
[SPEAKER_02]: sandwich and it just, oh, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So curry with mayonnaise makes one of the
best aiolis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially just where it's a hint of it,
where it just, it's slightly yellow,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you get that curry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lifts everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of those ones that's
slightly, just a little something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the world is about diversity and
differentiation from place to place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that where you can go to someplace
and they got something special like that
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little, you like to have somebody
put a twist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted everything to be exactly the
same, I would just go to McDonald's,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is great sometimes because you do
want something to be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like McDonald's, but yes,
I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consistency is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, McDonald's is mostly evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the evil empire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just sometimes I like to see how their
expression of the culture is when I'm in a
[SPEAKER_03]: different country, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, cause you can get a goat
cheeseburger in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put goat cheese on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents love McDonald's out of the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they want to go see what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you just want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you just want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not eating there every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, Oh my God, thank God
there's McDonald's, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of stone and water in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go see this goat cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just see what the lamb mac,
let's just see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I love a, I love a local twist
or a, however, however you like to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: at your spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're not too heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the pickles.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I love good homemade pickles too.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good homemade pickle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again though, there's a difference
sometimes between, I mean, Vlasik makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: good pickle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not a big, I think it's a vinegar
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big vinegar-er-er.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm Scandinavian, so I pickle
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pickle everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, whatever you can pickle, we'll pickle
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pickle that.
Pickled soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love pickles, but you know, pickled
carrots, pickled green meats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you make the pickle sandwich?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they use two big slices of pickle
and they put all the meat in the things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but no bread is just a pickle sandwich.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do pickled strawberries with jalapenos
and they have a little red, red wine
[SPEAKER_02]: vinegar and a little white vinegar and a
bunch of sugar, but what happens when you
[SPEAKER_02]: use the red wine vinegar is it doesn't let
the strawberry lose its color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It maintains the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has, it's this, but you have to eat
them 24 hours after you make them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, how long do you pickle
them for?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a quicker pickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a quickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a quickle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're frigerator pickles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do that overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You eat them the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good for about 24 to 48 hours max.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're spicy because you slice that,
especially when you use spicy jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gives you that green jalapeno
flavor with a little kick of spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you put it in a salad?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just eat them straight out the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have them, you put them on a bagel
with the cream cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't wait till we do a food
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put those with cream cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put them on a fresh bagel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love homemade bagels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toasted bagel?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will make bagels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to toast bagels if they're
fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they come right out and they can be
room temperature, if they're really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Locksmith Bagels in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Main Street Bagels in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not been there, but I love bagels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even Noah's Bagels is okay in a
pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a pinch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's in a pinch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a pinch, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go to Noah's Bagels,
you end up at Noah's Bagels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a destination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a destination location,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the line at the brunch spot is
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you get a small bagel while you wait
for your actual meal or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so there's these freezer bagels and
I don't know the name off hand,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they have robots making these freezer
bagels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fricking amazing for what they
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're at like Boutique, Linares has
them in their freezer section.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, they're made by robots.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new spot, a new bagel delivery
service in Sacramento, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_03]: outside their zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, they make them all small
batch by hand and then they deliver them
[SPEAKER_03]: on bicycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: On bicycle, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're keeping the carbon footprint low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Low, low, low, low.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I, I don't really wish I lived.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sometimes I wish I still lived in
midtown, but I have a really nice spot and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not super expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just rambling at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were three different weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on like five different weeds right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five different weeds, three types of
mushrooms and some DMT.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a bad chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on your mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did you get your start with
comedy?
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always kind of funny as a kid,
you know, self-defense mechanism becomes a
[SPEAKER_03]: career, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Class clownish a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of my teachers, one time,
in high school, asked me to do a set at
[SPEAKER_03]: like the intermission between bands
because I was in the band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like one band would play and then I did
like 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did other comic stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, in college... So Eddie
Murphy Raw?
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school, like the red fox that I could
tell his students in a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was, it was long,
it was before Eddie Murphy Raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like around... Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eddie Murphy comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard Pryor, Bob Newhart, Steve Martin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Classics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red Fox.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little Eddie Murphy, because I was like
14 when that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Robin Williams back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robin, hero, a monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic comedians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super talented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super talented.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Utilizing all of his talents on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I think in stand-up comedy,
we can forget that we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: skills, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you watch like Richard Pryor,
like he's acting his ass off while he's
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you watch Robin, he's utilizing all his
physicality, all his voices, all his
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan Winters.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even, you know, we talk about 80s,
90s cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill Hicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Arsenio Hall was very funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Arsenio Hall, one of the kids I grew up
with, my friend's younger brother,
[SPEAKER_02]: was the guy, the kid that drove the,
I think it was a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the intro to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who stalled it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was basically, he didn't do it on
purpose, but they ended up leaving it in
[SPEAKER_02]: because they thought it was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the universe also has a sense of
humor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then, you know, I'd been a comic
maybe two years before starting to become
[SPEAKER_03]: like a more serious cannabis activist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm always like, let me host your
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me MC for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to throw the occasional cannabis
comedy festival, which is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because sometimes we'd wait a year and
throw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we'd throw two or three at a
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we'd wait two years to throw
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't like the annual.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the occasional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The occasional cannabis comedy festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're just mixing that and doing
that and doing the Seattle Hempfest and
[SPEAKER_03]: just going anywhere I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, talking about it on stage
all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have other jokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk about quantum physics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sex and being a nerd and all kind of
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's like, it's like
anchovies on a pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned weed twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're a weed comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much anymore that weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day when it was against the
law, everybody's like, oh, he's a weed
[SPEAKER_03]: comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, we don't need him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're like, we need someone to
come over and talk about weed for a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes they call me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they need someone younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so where is the place that you had
the most fun doing stand up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what was the biggest craze?
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you've done stand up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comedy in the park, San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I grew up in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started like the Holy city zoo and
the rose and thorn and a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other cafe every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my first paid gig was at the El Rio on
mission street.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some really good shows in some
really weird spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Idaho falls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Idaho used to have a great club called the
pepper tree out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to always have a good time out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakland, San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I killed them at the war field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just everywhere, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every show is a good show, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it right, more intimate shows or
the bigger show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like to stand on stage and talk,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's a different,
it's a different approach and how you do
[SPEAKER_03]: the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're doing the smaller show,
you can talk a little faster, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: if they're all right up on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make smaller faces, but more
intricate faces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody can see you're,
you know, it's like, you're watching a
[SPEAKER_03]: closeup magician at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you're at the big spot where
it's 2,500 people or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to talk a little slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to wait a little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that joke's got to go all the way to
the back of that giant freaking auditorium
[SPEAKER_03]: and then come all the way back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to make a bigger faces
and maybe fewer of them because I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: now with the modern technology,
they got the bigger screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's easier to treat a bigger room,
like a smaller room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you see these guys doing stadiums
and they have these huge jumbotrons or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comedy needs face.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a physical activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really need a lot of the cues you
get from the eyes or from the,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the face or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned, although I used to listen
to albums like this all the time and
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine their faces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love doing that back in the day with
vinyl theater of the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I loved reading books and
imagining what was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have these movies now and
everybody's so focused on movies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, I also love books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put the movie in your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would cast the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, this one's going to be an
animated feature because clearly with the
[SPEAKER_03]: science, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so let down with movies sometimes
because of reading the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read the book and then I'm like,
wait a second, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two different universes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two different, completely different
universes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book universe is different from the
movie universe and you just have to accept
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that multiverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the multiverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to accept it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy goes to a movie theater and he notices
that the dude sitting next to him has
[SPEAKER_03]: brought his dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not so weird, but the thing is the
dog is way into the movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dog wags his tail at the happy parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He whimpers when it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He growls at the villain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the movie's over turns to the guy
who brought the dog, he says, man,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really surprised to see that your
dog enjoyed the movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, I was too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hated the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold for laughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hated the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hated the book.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So growing up in San Francisco,
that's where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you liked weed before they even had
names when it was green bud and brown bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it was weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a nickel bag that sometimes
you could get for $4.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, weed was $30 an eighth and it was just
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every once in a while, some shit will come
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sometimes it had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since Amiya was really just getting
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was, uh, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed some of that seeded stuff to be
a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you felt lucky when you found a
seed too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that Mexican stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was good and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was different levels to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, you had to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out Janet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, uh, Dr. John, uh, shout out all
my old weed man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out my boy Doug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out all my eighties and nineties
weed, weed people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. John Hudson, man, but he rest in
peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wasn't really a doctor, but we called
him that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he got into growing cannabis because
he thought his sister had cancer and he
[SPEAKER_03]: had heard that it could help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he started growing cannabis and then it
turned out he was really good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really good at growing weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, he used to grow great,
fantastic weed and, uh, he got busted back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had opened a little, uh, dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he was selling because his weed was so
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was selling it to all the clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got busted by the feds twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, man, why don't you quit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an important thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, all right,
man, but just be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one day the DEA showed up and just
scared him off and they were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to quit right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he disappeared for a while and then
he came back and then he passed away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, welcome to sad talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to James loud talking quietly about
sad things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think if you were to look a
hundred years in the future, you would
[SPEAKER_02]: think it was kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole thing that's gone on with
prohibition of cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you look a hundred years in the past too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people would think it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did people act like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: How could we have been so blind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why were we so short sighted?
[SPEAKER_03]: When then they watched the James live
podcast and the answer is usually either
[SPEAKER_03]: racism or sexism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually the answer to why things
are not how you want them to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's hard for some people to
look at that, but yeah, that's generally
[SPEAKER_03]: answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go way back, it's pretty complex
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the financial.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally it's either racism or sexism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times it's just racism,
especially in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure you'll probably get some
comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm watching this on YouTube,
I will try to chime in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remain cogent and don't lose your
mind, we're going to have a reasonable and
[SPEAKER_03]: a reasoned and erudite debate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just talking all willy nilly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times in America,
the reason cannabis was against the law
[SPEAKER_03]: was racism.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take, you can, yeah, as complex as
it is, you can break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way down to racism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the, that is the reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the exact reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, why a lot of cannabis laws were so
strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or racism, which is funny because black
people smoke weed at a little smaller rate
[SPEAKER_03]: than white people, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think these are important topics
for my show though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much, I mean, I'll come on every
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have a little serious debate
for 15 minutes, 15 serious minutes with
[SPEAKER_03]: them guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be lemon James loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's these kinds of things that change
people's perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you don't have the hard
conversations, how do you change things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and I love talking about stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love talking about the hard
conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's so many we can talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a, here's a hard question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold water hash or BHL.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a, I'm going to get a little
bit of hate for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked the tough questions, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the tough questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we look at BHL, BHL, as far as
processed with solvent, with butane,
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually get the water soluble
terpenes that you don't get from bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as for a flavor, I think that
there's nothing wrong with butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy the flavor of BHL if it's
processed and made correctly with care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think BHL is an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimal amount of explosions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, even minimal explosions,
eyebrows, all those things intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a trend with, with a blast to
get home or whatever first became a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the dab heads be like,
Oh yeah, man, I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, man, it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens is like somebody learn
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They learn technique, they get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They set themselves on fire and then they
quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco, there was multiple fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was hotel fires.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to giggle about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's honest, you know,
and, and people, people had accidents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but as far as like a product,
I think the product, BHL is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think bubble hash and rosin are great
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not true solvent list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about it on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoy those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, static hash is, I'm super stoked on
the static.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lay this process on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So static hash is where you, you know,
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simplest way to do it is to put the,
you're, you're basically your Keef or your
[SPEAKER_02]: sift on, on a piece of parchment and you
rub it with the glove and then whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks to the glove, you brush it off into
a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's basically using static.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just how to get like the tiniest
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's machines that do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a super fancy finger hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so now we're reinventing the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back to what we did years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our static hash is lovingly handcrafted by
only superior people with small yet
[SPEAKER_03]: delicate hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wave the static and they brush.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use a ostrich plume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually have machines that do
with plates, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that is a true solvent list product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not running water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting a full, do you prefer
oppressed any of the other concentrating
[SPEAKER_03]: styles?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I like, I like good bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like, I like Rosin too,
but I really like good bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got my old school classic atom
smasher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use still the three hole bowl that has
the holes on the side where they're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heat the rod up, you push it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot knives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do hot knives too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have a, I have a joke of my act
about back in my day, we didn't have vape
[SPEAKER_03]: pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had two hot knives at a broken wine
bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or toilet paper, toilet paper,
paper towel, too, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really hot knife.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one really has a gas stove.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're going to do a hot knife next
time you're on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash under glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those old nostalgic things and
bringing back the past, showing people how
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think they're reinventing the wheel
with some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything new was everything old is new
again or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what they say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bell bottoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jinkos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jinkos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jinkos should have never left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love a baggy pant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twice the material, twice the price.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just, it shows you're
affluent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I still have like my
collector's edition Jinkos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some with the, I have the ones,
the corduroy with the wide pipe,
[SPEAKER_02]: the what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The old piping or whatever it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wide whale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wide whale corduroy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have my Jinkos and I lost my Fubu.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where my Fubu jersey went.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an old school Fubu jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were those space boot looking shoes
that they had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Space boots?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not the Doc Martens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Doc Martens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a specific brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Uggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pre Uggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Luggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I held onto my shoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Luggs, but I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, it was Luggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Luggs?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Luggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Luggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like space boots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they did have the construction
looking ones, but the Luggs, the white
[SPEAKER_02]: Luggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I held onto those till probably 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much raving did you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved, I loved parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your rave name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't tell anybody that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody listen and be like, that's him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was my dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some celebrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Harrison Ford was like a handyman
and other jobs in LA before he hit big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she said she went to see Star Wars.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, why is my weed dealer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we had some of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought weed from Han Solo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that would be epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the raves we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw early days of DJ Dan and Donald
quad and Christopher Lawrence was one of
[SPEAKER_02]: my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tony and Yano, just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, Mark Farina with
mushroom was such a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start dating yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You throw names out like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People Mark Farina, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was all over San Francisco at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was crushing that mushroom jazz was
amazing for you guys that don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look up mushroom jazz, Mark Farina,
absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had some San Francisco house
music was epic and break beats before
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that around like the I beam and lips,
the lips underground and, uh, 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, 10, 15 for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The home base parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd end up at the end up in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd end up at the end up the end up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they end up with stops serving booze
at two and then start serving like mimosas
[SPEAKER_03]: and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 10 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rough, but we had a party called
strawberry Sundays and that was epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was some after parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the after parties to raves and then
you go to the after parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we used to rave for like four
days in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat, sleep, rave, repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rinse, repeat every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But great music, great people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed my childhood cause this
was in my, you know, pre 21 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bounce back from that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleep is for wussies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to great music and partying and
smoking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one constant with all that stuff was
the weed though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we all smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved weed back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always loved weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been the constant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lance red champagne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Romulan Romulan train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Odyssey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when train wreck just first
came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when white widow finally made
it to the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we had gone to Amsterdam like a year
before that and spoke some white widow and
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone was like, Oh, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then like a year later started showing up
in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: GDP was a little bit later, but that a new
skin, that new skin or the Alaskan
[SPEAKER_02]: thunderfuck was special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously Northern lights is a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had skunk, skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it, it was called strawberry
because it was strawberry sized nuggets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the real skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of the ones before the
2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a long time ago, but there was
some good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shaman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I did, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so many years ago and Northern lights
crosses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still get a little tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was sometimes some like a Maui,
Maui, Maui.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Maui, Maui.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember getting that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one, I don't know what it was,
but I used to get this from my boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just call it magic harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause my homie knew somebody in Portland
who grew, he's retired now, so don't go
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for him, but he would harvest on
the solstices and the Equinox,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like he had it super hippie dialed
in on his indoor shit and it was so
[SPEAKER_03]: flavorful and the high was super pleasant
and it was just stinky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was stinky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm driving it down from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it in like two ziplocks in a plastic
thing wrapped in another ziplock and my
[SPEAKER_03]: car still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I had a little bit in my jacket and
my home girl from across the gym was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: dog, is that you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a friend because the next door
neighbor smelled us smoking it and he came
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have to put it in coolers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now obviously they have bags that are
smell resistant, but coolers were a great
[SPEAKER_02]: way to transport stuff back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying like we try, I, you could,
it was just stinky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed was back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed back in the nineties when I was
smoking, there was some stuff that was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you couldn't get the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cat piss was one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a tenth of a gram would smell your
whole house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about this little tiny
piece right here that if it was in your
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket, everybody, everywhere you went
would smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cats come walking in from the next room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what is going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the reasons I really like
the synonym loud for cannabis because it
[SPEAKER_03]: describes exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That weed is loud dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives you synesthesia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could hear you smoking that weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear that weed from over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You open that bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bells went off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite new synonym?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tree, fire, gas, loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still like dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a dank diplomat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on your side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means I'm uncomfortably moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like the name dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dank is just a great name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great description of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially that really good dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like a nineties kid with dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hella dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crippler.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the Crippler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think chronic comes from like habitual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's a chronic and habitual user of
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that KGB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer green bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer green bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're releasing with the cannabis brothers
KGB for a California gas bill spelled with
the KGB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the CGB.
[SPEAKER_02]: KGB.
[SPEAKER_02]: California is smaller than K.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: KGB.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going back to the KGB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see how you think you're rushing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really you should take your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we put, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wifi type ZBX, which is a Skittles
back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the candy and you get the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely heavy on the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: That nose burning gas with a little bit of
great color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much emphasis do you place on color?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are you always trying to get a
little pink or purple in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you sometimes, I mean, train wreck
is just bright green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's my thought on the whole process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market loves purple right now.
Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: The markets always love purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a time where you couldn't
sell purple to save your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was GDP and then purple Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember having problems with
purple Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I never, I never smoked it,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a point where GDP came
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all of a sudden everyone hates it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's made with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brought the color back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like if you're Fino hunting and
you're really going through stuff and you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the purple Fino versus the green
Fino in a progeny of a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: siblings, the ones that are louder are
going to be more green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find a lot of times, yeah, you're
correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also find a lot of times that if
it's too purple, like the high will be
[SPEAKER_03]: nice, but it'll be short lived,
short lived.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if, cause they're
picking it early to keep the purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on, but a lot of
times that purple, but a lot of times that
[SPEAKER_03]: purple, the high doesn't last as long as
you think it's going to last as you get
[SPEAKER_03]: with maybe something the same way in
green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very cultivar dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cultivars are meant to be purple and
a lot of people try to force their shit to
[SPEAKER_02]: be purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just put beet juice in your
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, let's go with cold temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put ice on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to freeze it, throw it some
beet juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to do all the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it takes to get it purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because purple is what sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that mentality is, it's here,
but it needs to go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you still keep an eye on color when
you're picking phenols or do you just pick
[SPEAKER_03]: for smell and turps?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, effect and turps are two different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Entourage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you want the entourage, but how does
it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: But really we go through and take the
loudest smell and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoke everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all those 600 we had a day,
literally everybody smoked everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, I can help if you need some help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a former judge of the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: My rates are very reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pay in weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically sit around and talk about
it and we fill out forms with all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking it seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking it very seriously because
we're trying to find that next new winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes a lot of work and energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't just grow it out once.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to grow it out another time and
then compare it to the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: On average, how many seasons?
[SPEAKER_03]: We will assume a season is 12 to 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it take for you to get a good
finished phenol from?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you started with 600.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe two months later you have 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that first batch you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of the 60 we have superstars
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: You already have five you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say we have 10 out of those that
are superstars where I know they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know my lines anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we already knew going in that we want
to pop more of these than other ones
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's going to be winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my drips that you can get
online, there was 20 things and out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: 20, 15 were keepers where it's like we got
to regrow 15 of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times I'll pop a hundred and we
might keep two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it just depends on how well
you know your lines, what you're breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say we're breeding for seeds and
cuts or seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's say we can breed for
commercial viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going to work on the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's candy gas that yields really well
that that's mold and mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick finishing is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick finishing will make you more money
because people want, let's say you have
[SPEAKER_02]: something that finishes in 45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get nine rips per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine rips per year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's value in something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if you have something that
finishes in 42 to 45 days, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that fast?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have one that finishes in 42 days
to 45 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has over 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: How tall is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it bushy?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bushy, but it's very vigorous and
it's also purple.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how's the mold resistance on a
bushy fast growing plant like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have time to get moldy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these things have a lot of
commercial viability as far as,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the turf profile the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it's really high in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for processing for extraction,
when we're processing for hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has potential for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's different- Hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an old school one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great old school one.
[SPEAKER_02]: G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Vortex?
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember the Vortex?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the Vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the Ayoda?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the Ayoda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also remember the Sage, the Sativa
Afghani genetic equivalents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old school DJ short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember multiple blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the DJ short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever smoke any of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a New York blueberry diesel out
of Portland one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember blueberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember New York blueberry
diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: All blueberry on the inhale and then all
diesel on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry Durbin diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to high school with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was some old school winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some special stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring them back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's got the seed vault?
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably have something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a seed vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a really special seed vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of stuff from all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if I were to write a heist movie,
we would just be taking some samples from
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's seed vault.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got lots and lots of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what those are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all the B, C, and D grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those don't germinate,
and that's why we use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run them through a machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feed them to the parrots?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, but we use them as a prop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you put a hole in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the hole in the playing deck at the
card deck at the casino, and then you can
[SPEAKER_03]: just take them home with the old ones.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got coffee there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're smelling and you're
phenohunting, you're going through these
[SPEAKER_02]: things, you can clean your palate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you do a lot of phenohunting and
whatnot in your life, but do you also
[SPEAKER_03]: judge events and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've judged for high times in the Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been some of the early, early cups I
used to throw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I threw the LA Medical Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we threw three of them in LA in
the mid 2005 through 2007, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I throw events, I did the
Dab-A-Doo last year for Miele.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dab-A-Doo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miele the Hash Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Sam Rosentek and Focus V.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the Dab-A-Doo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do it again this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Need a host?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hosting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Need a co-host?
[SPEAKER_02]: We might need a host, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: A real host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just the guy who hosted, but that
doesn't mean we don't need a real host.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you definitely need to come to
the event and try all the events.
[SPEAKER_02]: When is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't picked a date.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as we know, we will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to include you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to be included.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those kind of events are just so nice
to be asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's so nice to have a good
emcee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It often is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's bad ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's everything in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes across the board with
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes across the board with
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is everything and everything in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which way do you think the genetic market
is headed this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is gas making a comeback?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour, gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour, gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see it all come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you predict a return of the classics,
retro vintage throwback jersey weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bell bottoms are coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way back to bell bottoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Panama Red.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if it's the old school
Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people claim to have Acapulco Gold in
a few different spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing it in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing it in a couple other spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the trap world isn't ready for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trap scene, probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always about the hype,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see on the rec market, people
wanting Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: People wanting Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: People wanting Panama Red.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the Acapulco Gold, you give it to
your granddad or your dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also see that one to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming back, the THC CBD one to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a one to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go so far as to say I like a
three to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a three CBD to one THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smoke it all day while you do your
things and not a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we didn't get too much THC
is not bad, but stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also sometimes I don't want to be that
THC high for my whole day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to do a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's one of those ones where
you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the smell of the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not everybody's jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't met one person who smoked this
with me and was like, ah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't either, but you'll see people in
the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, eh, it's not strong enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they strong enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go out drinking, do you always
just do shots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of 151?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you just chugging Everclear right out
the bottle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, grain alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you just shooting grain alcohol?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Catch a buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rosin too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those ones you can dab after
dab after dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you just want to catch a nice
buzz, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the movies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to be crazy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to a place that's very loud
where I don't really know anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not trying to be crazy high or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to have a nice little,
I'm not afraid to talk to people buzz.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little smile on my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a time and a place for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find me by the snacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to smoke red Congo all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do like red Congo, but red
Congo makes me giggly and laugh
[SPEAKER_02]: uncontrollably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pick the right weed for the right
activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke responsibly.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an adult, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I act like a kid half the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still an adult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that old, you know, people often
confuse me for an adult because of my age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all just, big kids trapped in old
people's bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be 48 in a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be older than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've aged well.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old stoners are always cuter than old
drunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just the argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to argue the quality of life
with cannabis versus the quality of life
[SPEAKER_02]: with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, listen, not everything's for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people can be fairly healthy,
responsible drinkers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a social thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The French are pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a non-drinker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely have a beer on a hot day
or every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got a full bar over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every once in a while you should,
maybe not should, not for everybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: but every once in a while the right move
is to get a little hammered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not necessarily occasionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing that every day or every
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but if I go to Spain, I want to go
drink some good wine with my friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: have some good food, and make some good
memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to spend six hours eating some
long ass dinner, drinking all the wine,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you kind of stumble home singing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you end up at somebody's private
chess club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four in the morning, you're rolling up
joints, hanging out, a good old time after
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it's supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's Spain, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll see you out there then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we eating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pasadillas del Pep.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaso del Oro is another hidden gem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pasadillas del Pep.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no sign on the front door.
[SPEAKER_02]: You walk down this alleyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to pick a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm throwing a party again this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to wander around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take you to a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to take me to a spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my city, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona is your city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it could be your city, too,
but it's definitely my city.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I think of all the cities out there,
San Francisco, Barcelona, those are my
[SPEAKER_03]: cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I often start looking for apartments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I would ever move,
but I often, sometimes when I'm there,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, well, I could live in this part of
town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have a little Pied Aterre right
over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's so affordable, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like it used to be, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's still pretty affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no longer cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: When COVID hit, we were looking at
signing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, literally, the day before,
they were getting the paperwork typed up
[SPEAKER_02]: for an apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was either $15, or 1200 euro a
month, which is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably had a little balcony.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at Barceloneta, and it's like walking
distance to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's way cheaper than here,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like a vacation apartment,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, COVID happened when it did,
and not the day before, because I would
[SPEAKER_02]: have signed that lease, and then obligated
it to pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as it happened, we didn't end up
signing the lease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love spending time there with some of
my best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my best friends lives there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Barcelona so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a shout out to my friend Abba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Abba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your social club of choice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Social club of choice, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I spend a lot of time at Strain
Hunters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most Amsterdam style of the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they probably have the best food,
although all their food is kind of sugary
[SPEAKER_03]: and deserty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very expansive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very comfortable, and they got the
booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Dr. Do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, and there's so many good
clubs over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should write a list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to my Patreon next week, and you'll
find I'll write a list of my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bloom Room's another good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking for some exotic flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloom is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, it's just a little walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Calada.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Calada is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys love the concentrates out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they know concentrates really well
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to the new Doja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doja's got a spot out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a couple of new ones that I
haven't been to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Barcelona is just such a great city.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything's very convenient to get
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you can walk around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find so many good local weed
clubs, because it's technically illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're just supposed to smoke in the
club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Barcelona isn't as strict as
other spots in Spain, but they're cracking
[SPEAKER_03]: down because a lot of tourists don't know
how to act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, 10 years ago, you could roll a
joint in your restaurant of choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your go-to tapas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaso de Oro, which I shouldn't be telling
people, so then it might ruin it for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody, because it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Vaso de Oro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cup of gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup of gold, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have really good beer there,
but also nice tapas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinchos is a great spot for tapas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Pasadillas del Pep is my favorite
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so many good restaurants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say, we'll spend the day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get small by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a grazer, so I love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Bilbao, because they're
graze-friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamon, Iberico?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pork gives me the wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will definitely have a few slices of
it here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't go crazy on it, because then
all my compatriots will be mad at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my flirting opportunities would be
severely diminished.
Right.
Understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But tapas are amazing in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did go on a quest for the best papas
bravas one time, which seems there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: many different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's so many great places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona has a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think your producer is going to stare at
us, because we're just going to start
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about food and travel again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey, this is a weed show,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now here's how we switch it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm high, I love eating popo a la
gallella, which is one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: things, which is octopus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Octopus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, with the potatoes and the olive oil
and the paprika.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's done right, it is absolutely
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't always eat the octopus,
because I feel bad, because I feel like we
[SPEAKER_03]: should be learning from them more than we
should be eating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You watched the octopus teacher?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, even before then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even before then.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're intelligent sentient beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just kind of being.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that cows are not intelligent sentient
beings as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have this relationship with alpacas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked on a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a farm up in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked on there, and they had alpacas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was six of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would know when I was coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would come greet me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would give me hugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would literally put their neck on my
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time, my friend came, and he saw these
alpacas coming up to me, giving me hugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking to these alpacas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're friends, and they're looking at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Communicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would go smoke weed with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had red eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, man, I hope my eyes aren't
this red.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I bring my friend, and he's looking at
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gets all excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he starts walking towards them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets spit on from six directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: He literally couldn't cover his face fast
enough from both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, we don't really know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just be walking up on alpacas.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to make friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And alpacas are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had one either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw on some cooking shows,
I've seen them as the mystery basket where
[SPEAKER_02]: they get the alpaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get the alpaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you treat it like a lamb, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You slow roast it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you don't have time if it's chopped
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make it like a camel, alpaca,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like alpaca's a little leaner
than camel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made camel tacos before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't eaten your camel taco.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not an inside joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've also had, well, we might be
talking about two different camel tacos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But moose knuckles, camel tacos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Camel toe taco is one of my favorite
treats.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a delicacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an acquired taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I liked them from the beginning.
Hammer band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hammer band.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't have a succulent Chinese meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't talk about moose knuckles?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to pickle them with your
Scandinavian ass?
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pickle moose knuckles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a reindeer and moose knuckles,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scandinavian delicacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reindeer and moose knuckles.
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like a private eye show coming
to Fox.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be on Tubi next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an autistic deer who knows a lot and
a lady in tight pants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reindeer and moose knuckles this fall on
Tubi.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go any direction with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where do you see the world going with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally would like to have it where I
can buy Moroccan hash the same way I buy
[SPEAKER_03]: French wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want a Spanish haze and a Moroccan
hash from my local spot, you should be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be able to get New York diesel
from New York or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing in Maine and Vermont right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about chars as long as no child
labor violations happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, chars, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the best chars comes from the
tender hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bit of my act where I talk about
the best hash, of course, made from the
[SPEAKER_03]: thighs of the virgins after they run naked
through the cannabis fields three days
[SPEAKER_03]: before the harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hard to find a virgin out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see it getting closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Switzerland will probably be legal in the
next few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy Heineken.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better be able to buy weed from
everywhere just the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Switzerland, you can buy hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy high CBD hemp in the liquor
store already.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's up to 1% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will have an effect on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will have.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning, people used to say CBD
is not psychoactive, which is not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not psychoactive the way that THC
is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it does pass the blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that regard, yeah, it's sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely has side effects that are
very pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psychedelic?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes the stuff- Which is
different than being an active psycho.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's much better than being an active
psycho, which there's plenty of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: An active psycho on psychoactives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never turn your back on a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Double negatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be hella smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might correct it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in this strange time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful time, but it's still a
strange time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's always been a strange
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day is a strange day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a little stranger than it usually
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people who want to be
emperor.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why you shouldn't always teach the
classics.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys want to be Alexander the Great
anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we live in an age where there's so
much information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be able to discern for
yourself and you have to make good
[SPEAKER_03]: choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't talk about why I'm not
smoking today, but I had surgery last week
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they gave me a gum graft at that
age.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been telling me I need a gum graft
for 20 years finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I can't smoke though.
[SPEAKER_02]: For how much longer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably two more days.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many edibles are you on?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can eat some edibles, raws and gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love raws and gummies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not that you're not utilizing the
medical benefits of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that you're not smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I drank this rice coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the mushrooms in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they a sponsor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should talk about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all hyped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on rise in edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pour a little moonshine,
or I was going to say, if you pour a
[SPEAKER_03]: little corn liquor into that coffee,
then it's rise and shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rise and shine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took so long to get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so much funnier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like getting a nice warm hug from
your ancestors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not in the scary way.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Johnny said about White
Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like getting a nice warm hug from
your ancestors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed somebody years later,
a friend of mine had gone to Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: State.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a really good bag of trainwreck
from a homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I handed her the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: She opened it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, yeah, it smells like college.
Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her trainwreck first started coming down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that exact smell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the old crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much B.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange crush to name some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all blurs together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was so strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would hit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would hit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would punch you in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's before a nine pound hammer or
whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever... Jägermeister out of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like mid 2000s though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were mids too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I never got excited about Jäger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got it on at late.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I tried it, dog shit from Oregon
was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to go up there and find your homie
who actually couldn't just... Because I
[SPEAKER_03]: can agree that sometimes you get it down
here or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't the... It's kind of like how
Blue Dream is hated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's Jäger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get the right one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get somebody to put a bunch of love
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they just called it Jäger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's still that danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you had Green Bodhi on a little while
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from up there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: His flower is next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect from his flower is so special.
You got me laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do at the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do at the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll follow you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so much to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just keep you on every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: My rates are very reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pay me a lot of weed though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got to go sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I ran the magazine, people were
always like, we want to buy an ad,
[SPEAKER_03]: but can we pay you a weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, you give me an extra job.
[SPEAKER_03]: The day I could go to the printer and be
like, let me give you five pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You run 30,000 copies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a day you can give me a quarter
pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quarter pounds aren't worth what they used
to be either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I got to turn around and sell it
to make the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't pay in weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and smiles don't cut it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I like a handshake and a pat on
the ass, I can't applaud.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go to your landlord like,
we really like living here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a marketing class.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all marketing these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least in comedy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also take a video editing class,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I just thought I was going to be a
comic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know I had to be like a video
editor and a sound mixer and a master
[SPEAKER_03]: marketer and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a lot of what it comes down to
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's always been that a little
bit, but even more and more now,
[SPEAKER_03]: and especially now because everybody's
just expected to do all those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social media is like a whole nother job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now you have to be a social media
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're also a standard comedian.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also got to write things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have to be a content,
when I say content creator, but you have
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a production facility.
Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have planned for the future
for yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tranquility, inner peace, profitability,
all those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be, like I said, I'll see you
in Barcelona for the international
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis business conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be at the New Mexico Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: In mid-March.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I got to come back from Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the 22nd in Albuquerque.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on some things in the Desert
Hot Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be at the Missouri Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be at the Oregon Growers Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're doing an Emerald Cup
this year, so I probably won't be there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll be- Has that been canceled
officially?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I thought they had a five-year
contract in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe- Last I heard, but it's been
months since I talked to those guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I have to send some emails.
[SPEAKER_03]: But last I heard, they weren't going to do
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting Tim on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard not to do those because they are
so much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Emerald Cup is the one that
really, I think, takes time to celebrate
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant itself and not just party.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the problem with Emerald Cup is it's
supposed to be the Harvest Cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Harvest Cup that happens after
outdoor is done, or you can share your
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor with everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I grew outdoor in my backyard,
so I love bringing fresh outdoor to show
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody gets together to start
trading seeds and getting together for
[SPEAKER_03]: March or for April when they're going to
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and all the stress is gone for the
year, pretty much, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right before you all leave for Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy who drives the truck just got back
from LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're the right things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Purple Haze Diesel is crushing it
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people are trying to find more about
you- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just come to the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just come to the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Sacramento, South, so tell them
to ask around.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on most of the social things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: BlueSky, NGAIO420 on GAIO420, Instagram on
GAIO420, also Puff Puff Passport on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you put in NGAIO, Beelum,
they will probably take you to Puff Puff
[SPEAKER_03]: Passport because I'm lightly shadowbanned.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go to NGAIO420, I'll pop right
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to start posting more stuff
on Puff Puff Passport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: BlueSky, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can follow me on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lurk on Snapchat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can find me on Snapchat as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on the Tumblr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do people still do Tumblr?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never on TikTok or Tumblr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were my days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never once?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have accounts, but I never
really enjoyed either one of those apps.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_03]: TikTok does not like weed, so why would I
hang out with those guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make it so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not one of those guys, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came up here to talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really trying to put broccoli in
my ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to spell it O-U-I,
apostrophe D.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come from back in the activist days
where you stood up for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's so harder now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because back then, you could just stand up
for weed, and they can't really kick me
[SPEAKER_03]: off my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking self-employed, so I can do
what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I've got to rely on this Instagram
to get my word out, to do my marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's censorship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavy censorship for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell anybody where to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell them what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I post a stupid, if I post a weed meme,
then they don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll spread it around to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I post some shit like, this is
beta-carophiline.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's found in these sort of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a picture of a plant, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education goes against our guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mark Zuckerberg claims that he's
going to stop the censorship or reduce the
[SPEAKER_02]: censorship, only censoring really bad
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what he's talking about is
political ideas, which we don't have time
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've been here two hours already.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to try to stop people censoring
that, which is a whole different set of
[SPEAKER_03]: disinformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But them restricting the flow of cannabis
education, I think, will continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't be a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People come to my... You come to Ungayo
420 because you want to see weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: weed-related...
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like the Hank Hill of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sell weed and weed-related
accessories.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you come to learn about cannabis or to
hang out in the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not being able to do that is a drag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon in Ungayo 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only like a buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope your mouth feels better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great episode.
