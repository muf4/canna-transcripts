[SPEAKER_06]: you know when you're doing this stuff,
but this is the first time I've actually
[SPEAKER_06]: met Tim in person But I get a great story
about Tim we go to the same jujitsu school
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't train there as often as Tim does I
should be training more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be going back this week But I was
rolling the other day and this is actually
[SPEAKER_06]: like the other day like a year ago I was
rolling and it was the Afternoon and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: getting choked out and when I look up at
this mural I'm like man Illuminaries and
[SPEAKER_06]: then I go Rocky who did this and he's
like, oh, yeah Tim he trains here all the
[SPEAKER_06]: time Like no way who's Tim and then I'm
like and then I think I called you and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: like, who's Tim?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we kind of discussed it and so
it's a real small world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the jujitsu community is very
small The cannabis community is really
[SPEAKER_06]: small.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you know as far as like the
stuff you guys do it's extremely Small
[SPEAKER_06]: it's yeah, it's it's extremely extremely
small community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not our murals though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our murals are large-scale large Yeah,
but yeah, your murals are huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys do the hugest murals actually
some of the biggest stuff But as far as
[SPEAKER_06]: graffiti and street art, you know,
that's a very Exclusive community to a
[SPEAKER_06]: degree and there's only a handful of
people that do really amazing art There's
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of artists, but you guys do some
cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that Yeah, and you guys work
with the Warriors Who else Warriors Niners
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland A's Tesla Tesla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep Apple Apple Marriott.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah a bunch of bunch of big big brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the warrior stuff is super amazing
Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we kind of just fell into that niche
of Sports entertainment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really like what we meant it for
it to be but it kind of just steamrolled
[SPEAKER_02]: That way and you know, we just going with
the flow of it How early did you start
[SPEAKER_06]: doing art as early as you could remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I remember John a little bit
Here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I my parents would say I drew a lot
I didn't feel like I was drawing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say graffiti itself is what
kickstarted me to draw a lot because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the point we're like, oh man,
my stuff is Published on a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better learn how to draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used to draw a lot but I feel I
feel like I was That good until like
[SPEAKER_06]: graffiti kicked in so you didn't tell you
picked up a spray can I picked up a spray
[SPEAKER_00]: can it was the smell was it man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was How about you Steve kind of the same
route, you know, like I didn't my fondest
[SPEAKER_02]: memories of Drawing was when I was a kid
probably like six years old and then all
[SPEAKER_02]: my little cousins would come over and we'd
always copy these Garfield comics They had
[SPEAKER_02]: my Garfield had like hundreds of different
types of comics and we trace it and see
[SPEAKER_02]: who could trace it the best Yeah,
so I think just from there it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's like, you know, I think I
guys kind of just jump-started everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I first met Tim I Met him in high
school, right and I was doing graffiti and
[SPEAKER_02]: he was doing graffiti, but we didn't know
each other We had like a mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like damn he uses spray paint I use
spray paint like it was just a match made
[SPEAKER_02]: in heaven, but okay pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, did he?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but spray paint like transformed the
way I approached art Yes, because it's you
[SPEAKER_02]: know that that tool is a different type of
tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but just ever since we were
little man Just drawing drawing drawing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did airbrush when I did a lot of
art when I was growing up It was my mother
[SPEAKER_06]: was an artist too.
[SPEAKER_06]: She still is okay So I was exposed to a
whole bunch of stuff, you know everything
[SPEAKER_06]: from oil to watercolor to Airbrush I did a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took airbrush classes when I was
younger.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's as close as I got to really
Graffiti, right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you say you don't mess with it no
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have time for that I focus on the
things I'm really good at and try to take
[SPEAKER_06]: them to the next level and maybe art will
play a role You know, I feel like when I
[SPEAKER_06]: work with designers like yourself I have
my input on stuff and I look at it from
[SPEAKER_06]: that lens or I try my lens of my version
of that lens right artistic lens And
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes with packaging and stuff like
that I also have a partner who's extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: Artistic in some ways and he's really good
at layout and design and making things
[SPEAKER_06]: flow together and so I feel like I'm
creative in some ways and he's really
[SPEAKER_06]: Organized and creative and together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this nice mesh, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of how it works with me and him
Yeah, it's great having someone you can
[SPEAKER_06]: bounce ideas off that are complimentary
where it's not like it goes in a different
[SPEAKER_06]: direction It's like very complimentary and
I feel like with business which is 99% of
[SPEAKER_06]: what I do is James loud genetics and so I
stay focused on that and everything that I
[SPEAKER_06]: do revolves around improving James loud
genetics or Displaying James loud genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: or the podcast that talks about you know
Other people in the industry that kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: highlights the genetics and I feel like
everything I do kind of revolves around
[SPEAKER_02]: the business Yeah, how you do it art and
you know, I'm glad we were able to connect
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know and just like taking your
input in you know, just making things
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean It's next level the James loud
logo is next level.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody recognizes it and it's
very recognizable and distinct and people
[SPEAKER_06]: see it I recognize that from somewhere and
whether they recognize it from James loud
[SPEAKER_06]: or from the 70s or from whatever movie
they got it inspired by right right,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I feel like It really it stands
out and it really makes the brand pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell us about the Bay Area you guys
grew up here Yeah born and born and
[SPEAKER_00]: raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, yeah I'll grow up in Hayward
and then Fremont and then Newark we met we
[SPEAKER_00]: met high school in Newark and then I
transferred to Berkeley High and it my
[SPEAKER_00]: senior year and now it's just Open up
whole new world for me because I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into graffiti and um, Berkeley
High is one of them schools It was like
[SPEAKER_00]: before they rebuilt the school and it was
just one of the teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cared about anything Yeah,
we just walk around with spray paint and
[SPEAKER_00]: paint in the bathrooms and no one got in
trouble No one got in trouble in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hallways like it was reckless man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys ever get?
[SPEAKER_02]: In trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, definitely you ever get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got arrested probably three times
I think well Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got arrested way more times but for
graffiti like three times Dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: he has his crazy story though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: They set him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for graffiti Yeah, man,
it was some fucked up shit the parallels
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis and your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, so I mean he he's has a long
record and so they already knew who he was
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we was paint we were painting
There's three of us back then and no they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know who I was So they were waiting
to figure out who I was before they
[SPEAKER_00]: rounded us up And we also had a clothing
line back in the day called 594 gear which
[SPEAKER_00]: is the police code for graffiti So I don't
know how we thought we were gonna get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with that but somehow we had this clothing
line called 594 gear and then we're out
[SPEAKER_00]: painting and so this is like, you know,
this is Mid 90s mid late 90s and so like
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet was just kind of coming out
So I was like, oh, they know police online
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and um So like we would get a lot
of sales we get all these emails online
[SPEAKER_00]: about our shirts and all and some people
there's one particular person was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah I saw you guys up on the freeway
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dope blah blah blah blah and Like
oh, did you guys do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who who was with you and all that
stuff and also it's like us I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just answering you stroking my ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, oh, yeah, we did that blah
blah blah Probably I mean they already
[SPEAKER_00]: knew you were so didn't matter Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like yeah, this one day My parents kind
of knew what was going on, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: they were super cool about it They let me
paint my basement and they're just like
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do anything stupid like okay And
they kind of knew I was going out because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm my dad would be like he saw some stuff
on the field It's like that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks really familiar So one day it
was like I think it was like a Sunday
[SPEAKER_00]: evening we sat down for dinner and does
knock on the door and it was like at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time Bay Area Bart had a Graffiti task

the next morning you were there and they
[SPEAKER_00]: came and picked me up and they did,

[SPEAKER_02]: in the morning and all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's hella cops on the front door

[SPEAKER_02]: I seen Tim again They brought him out I
think in handcuffs or they escorted you
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the third person This cat Justin he
was already in the backseat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they Picked him up like in the morning
then went to Tim and then I guess they
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to go to my house But I wasn't even
there because I was at his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Damn, but they and they eventually
picked me up like three weeks later as I
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to work So yeah, man,
we all got hemmed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long were you guys locked up for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just it was for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just overnight and they get you
with a warning No, we had to go to court
[SPEAKER_00]: and do all that thing dual, you know,
we got a huge fine Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the fine ended up being like 30
40,000 Wow They're not messing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't pay it all The sexual
limitations is fast, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we good we Justin however,
like his parents were pissed and so it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like now we're just gonna leave you in
there Yeah, my parents made bail that my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom was freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But uh His his parents were like nah,
you we've already done this before so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just gonna sit there I think he was
in there for like three or four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was there for three days,
too Yeah, I called him my parents like yo,
[SPEAKER_02]: can you bail me out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah Hang up Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I mean it is what it is man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we ended up doing a bunch of
community service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually no Is that the one where we
paid off that chef?
[SPEAKER_02]: No comment Well, we had to do hella hours
of community service and then we found
[SPEAKER_02]: this chef and then he he owned this
kitchen and he just Paid him 50 bucks back
[SPEAKER_02]: then signed off all day though
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but anyway those paid it off and I
was like, yeah, I'm good like community
[SPEAKER_02]: service is Yeah terrible back then man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know how it is now,
but it's probably not as fun It just
[SPEAKER_06]: depends on what you're doing community
service, you know, you can go work in a
[SPEAKER_06]: soup kitchen It's probably not the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that would probably be trash on the
side of the freeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not fun Yeah, that's the one like
they'd warn you about needles and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and yeah, especially these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a lot worse Yeah,
I can oh, yeah, I can imagine right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was it like growing up in the Bay
Area?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I feel I grew up in the Bay Area
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I I think it was Amazing times were
blessed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all connected to the same music
industry the same Artists whether it's
[SPEAKER_06]: Grateful Dead or whether it's hip hop rap.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had amazing music.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had amazing culture yeah, man,
I think just The Bay Area was to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It showed me how to be Independent like
how to hustle how to do things for for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, you know, don't wait for nobody
But as far as growing up, it was just it
[SPEAKER_02]: was diverse man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the melting pot, you know,
you can go To the city and see all this
[SPEAKER_02]: graffiti.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go over here and just see all the
luxury or whatever, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like all different types of Brands and and
like you said like cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so to me it was it was beautiful,
man and Like we weren't growing up just
[SPEAKER_02]: graffiti was kind of in its own
Renaissance, you know, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: we're in another Renaissance and now as
far as like bombing in and just Shit
[SPEAKER_02]: getting trashed man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys ever in fact?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you saw it the optimist on the side
of 880 that was there forever I think they
[SPEAKER_06]: even tried to paint over it and then it
rained a whole bunch and then it came back
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's it's yeah the way area back
then for me was just like a big playground
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like yeah, especially in the
graffiti era I feel we feel I feel super
[SPEAKER_00]: blessed to be growing up under like we had
all these kings like above us like dream
[SPEAKER_00]: and crayon and Estria and all those guys
That they were just like we'd run into
[SPEAKER_00]: them at the railroad tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like free range there You know,
you had psycho city out in SF just so many
[SPEAKER_00]: like legal areas and the only only
downside it was very criminalized back
[SPEAKER_00]: then but it was just Cool to to have so
much inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just remember the first time
Like being super inspired by graffiti is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, I walked into this train
tunnel and just it was like floor to
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling all around I was just like what
the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is just a whole nother world And
I had to figure it out, you know So that
[SPEAKER_00]: was just that was a lovely part about the
bay, you know, I had the East Bay San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco side and In in that era was just
like so much innovation and style and all
[SPEAKER_06]: that Yeah, it's pretty amazing and same
thing with food and same thing I mean just
[SPEAKER_06]: art in general whether it's food or
whether it's even even wine like the
[SPEAKER_06]: innovation and wine California is very
innovative.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bay Area is very innovative We have so
many great minds thinking and I think you
[SPEAKER_06]: know, you get so many people together in
an area People start getting their minds
[SPEAKER_06]: working together.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get amazing things and amazing things
happen Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even like, you know, you move like a
few blocks down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get a whole different Variety of
you know, whatever culture and whatnot
[SPEAKER_02]: like Oakland versus San Francisco to me is
like very different Yeah, you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: especially as far as art too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell like what style lives where
or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's um This is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many like sub subcultures too
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many subcultures and some so much stuff
going on and there's always something
[SPEAKER_06]: someone's always doing stuff that's
different and new and growing up in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Bay Area and then Transitioning what do
you guys is this your favorite?
[SPEAKER_06]: Full-time career Now this is what you guys
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep Full-time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean full-time mirrorless, but then we
also have our own businesses side hustles
[SPEAKER_02]: and business Yeah, so I also run flavor
innovator, which is a graphic design
[SPEAKER_02]: studio So that's more focused on kind of
like key art CD music graphic design nice
[SPEAKER_02]: heavily graphic design and typography
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do software development on the
side And so I have I have another business
[SPEAKER_00]: with my cousin and some other friends that
we do We're an ISP out in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do software IT stuff But yeah,
I mean we were always faced with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when you're in the art business
You're always that things over your head
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay Should I make the jump to go
full-time and that was always clouding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess for the first few years and then I
think at some point we had we're at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross crossing point was like,
okay we could do this full-time is just
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want to do and somehow,
you know, I just had we had the idea like
[SPEAKER_00]: Why or at least for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why do I want to make this a
job?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know something like why would I want
to ruin something that I have like the one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I have a big passion for do I really
want to make it my job and start doing
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that I don't want to do and so
when we made that decision like no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just gonna keep it as a Side hustle
and so we have multiple side hustles going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a full-time thing and so then we
can just you know, have the luxury of
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying no to projects and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right That's kind of how it's gone
where you don't have to have it to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: the lights on and you can do it just a
hundred percent passion-driven Right where
[SPEAKER_06]: your stuff was pretty big.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that you guys blew up Maybe
you blew up before that, but that's when I
[SPEAKER_06]: really was like, wow, you guys are
crushing it Working with Steph Curry and
[SPEAKER_06]: all these guys and doing you know several
murals too around the same time Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that was kind of right place Right
time for us The first one we did was the
[SPEAKER_00]: one we did for fun for Steph.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the the Mac Dre It just happened
to go viral like the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just we got lucky there,
you know, and yeah, and that's what set
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got on his Steph's radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a year for them to to like
actually contact us and Then you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: net then a year later then we're finally
working with Steph directly, but it was it
[SPEAKER_02]: was pretty amazing Yeah, and funny story
about that one was So Tim found this wall
[SPEAKER_02]: it was on 27th and Northgate and He's like
damn this would be a dope spot a dope spot
[SPEAKER_02]: to go paint Steph Curry mural or a warrior
warriors mural and this was what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016-17 I think it was the first time it
was their first win when they started
[SPEAKER_00]: really blowing up and gelling and it was
like we looked down I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, there's no warriors murals anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cuz they're in the playoffs already
I'd had been eyeing this wall for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what we're gonna do on it I
just knew we had to do something cuz it
[SPEAKER_00]: was right by the freeway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing on it Well, it was all
graffitied up and I saw a gardener out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I was like, oh, hey,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we paint this?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, um, I mean the owner isn't even
in this state So, I mean you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: could and and I was like, okay,
then we're gonna come back next week So we
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and it's all locked up and I was
like homes like how do I what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, well just do what you need to
do and so I mean I had the bolt cutters
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go in there and so we just start
painting it and like no one's really
[SPEAKER_00]: messing with us so it was technically a
illegal mural and and and then but
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly like the the community the
neighborhood Started coming out and like
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us food and beer and they were
like, oh my god Thanks for for
[SPEAKER_00]: transforming this corner because it was
like a drug den before that and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like it attracted all this homeless and So
like that was the first time like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a light bulb moment for me was like
the transformation of art into the
[SPEAKER_00]: community I mean, I know that's it's kind
of cliche like obviously but at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like Whoa, this really did transform
this entire and it actually because the
[SPEAKER_00]: real literally like a couple weeks later
That spot which had been vacant for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade got run it out by like a car
company to use their lot So it like
[SPEAKER_00]: literally transformed that corner into
like a you know, productive area That's
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we helped gentrify that It's your
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys doing it just that whole
that little moment even I think it got so
[SPEAKER_02]: popular that when they won the
championship they ran the parade through
[SPEAKER_00]: there or not Or do they well the parade
came right by there, but we threw our own
[SPEAKER_00]: party there Yeah, so we had we brought a
DJ out and then I mean police were showing
[SPEAKER_00]: up trying to take pictures with it like we
had I think we had a few hundred people
[SPEAKER_00]: out there partying During the parade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that was a monumental Experience
that kind of just catapulted us,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know kind of again into that sports
and entertainment arena really cool not
[SPEAKER_06]: intentionally just kind of Serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think is the word serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean some of these things just magically
happen in our lives that you were you're
[SPEAKER_06]: on the right path and all of a sudden Next
thing Steph Curry's calling you guys up
[SPEAKER_02]: right, you know or yeah or whatever,
you know, but yeah, it's pretty amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: subconsciously trying to manifest it and
Wakes out man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah manifestation is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet I've kind of been Like
studying that or learning about it like
[SPEAKER_02]: the past year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh this um, who said this is
one guy doctor Joe Espinosa or something
[SPEAKER_02]: or he kind of talks about that like
Manifesting like your feelings and your
[SPEAKER_02]: your thoughts and actually really trying
to feel everything inside your mind and
[SPEAKER_02]: body like that way Like let's say I want
to be on Italy or something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can just in my mind if I can think it
But in my body if I really feel I'm out
[SPEAKER_02]: there then it'll manifest in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, eventually like subconsciously at a
subconscious level, but Well speaking of
[SPEAKER_06]: Italy and Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you guys had a chance to get out to
Europe and seen the Art out there the
[SPEAKER_06]: street art the graffiti.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think you yeah, he painted out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty impressive Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're like all the artists out there
I feel I look up to a lot of them out
[SPEAKER_02]: there where we do to Barcelona's off the
hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah I mean this I mean they really
took Good street art to another level I
[SPEAKER_00]: say in the There was a point where I feel
like, you know It started baton was passed
[SPEAKER_00]: to from the US because it was just so
locked down and criminalized here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really couldn't do much whereas over
there like you do whatever you want And so
[SPEAKER_00]: like they man that yeah, there's so many
amazing artists all over Europe that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's just taken over It's pretty
pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I had the opportunity to paint
in Albania Wow, that was super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I packed on my own I paint in my
suitcase and Somehow it made it across
[SPEAKER_00]: over there and nice I knew someone who
knew someone who knew the mayor of the
[SPEAKER_00]: capital city in Toronto, Albania and then
I just sent him my portfolio and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah You could just just paint any
any building you want kind of and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: driving around the city Showing me like
these huge like 10 story buildings like
[SPEAKER_00]: not I'm only here for like four days I'm
gonna paint in two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked one that was like three
stories tall and they assigned me like the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy with what Like one of those bucket
trucks and it was like it was it was so
[SPEAKER_00]: like touchy I couldn't I felt like I was
gonna fly out of it And so I actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a guy who didn't speak English
like do it for me on the ground And I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bucket and he's controlling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to like tell him where I'm going
and oh man It was awesome though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say I painted a painted a painted like
two story building a three story building
[SPEAKER_06]: up there cells so what's amazing how much
paint you can put on a building like like
[SPEAKER_06]: literally when you did the the buildings
you did Eric's buildings before before the
[SPEAKER_06]: building here and then you know,
I just saw how much paint you guys didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: how long it took Yeah, pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean how many gallons for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends like you're using
regular Home Depot paint or fusing spray
[SPEAKER_02]: paint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know the the values change but
What do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh spray paint spray paint is the weapon
of choice Krylon not Krylon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was still Krylon,
but now because when we came up Krylon and
[SPEAKER_02]: Rust-Oleum and even like orchard supply
was was our shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Now like and we kind of took a
little hiatus probably what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Five ten-year hiatus and then we came when
we got back on the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this new spray paint in Montana
So that was a game changer, you know with
[SPEAKER_02]: like the pressure like you almost felt
like not really airbrushing But it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: a low pressure thing so you can get all
these clean fades and whatnot and then
[SPEAKER_02]: plus with all these different tips and
caps and adapters and all the colors
[SPEAKER_02]: Game-changer by the Montana Montana 94 is
my preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that's I mean that's example the
year That's all the European companies
[SPEAKER_00]: like they they changed the game with their
spray paint You know, they because the
[SPEAKER_00]: Krylon is like came out like a fire
extinguisher, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that European stuff is like more
like an airbrush and press it low pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow I think there's a US company in there
now loop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But most most of the good paint out there
is not in from the US European and how are
[SPEAKER_02]: them fools using the Krylon back in the
day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so clean like they're even back in
the days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to get super clean characters
with this janky can you know is That
[SPEAKER_02]: skills right there skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah steady hands scaling up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna move really fast, too Fast and
smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man Lands like man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys see that building in LA that
they recently did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah He was there you were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was there after the fact I
wasn't there painting it but I was I was
[SPEAKER_00]: there a couple weeks ago and There's
police around at 24 7 now, but I bet it's
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing just went boom boom just quick,
dude Yeah, the amount of days like yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean huge like this the graffiti the level
of graffiti happening today is just
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible like, you know, they're using
ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're repelling They're just you know,
there's don't care, you know so many Navy
[SPEAKER_00]: SEALs doing graffiti Working together now,
which is I think a monumental that
[SPEAKER_00]: building, you know, the first one I think
was in Miami that they did that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then LA was the second one But like I
think to me what was huge about that other
[SPEAKER_00]: than obviously it's amazing is is all
these groups of writers that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: normally beef Probably I mean at least
when we were there like all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different crews are always beefing but
this was like a coordinated effort of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these cats that Maybe I don't know if they
all painted together or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I but I suspect that you know,
they organized Very organized and they hit
[SPEAKER_00]: it all real fast and like analysis like
every corner of that building is done So
[SPEAKER_06]: what do you think the biggest contributing
factor to this evolution is?
[SPEAKER_06]: technology, I Mean, we've had the internet
for 20 years now, but I feel like lately
[SPEAKER_06]: People have been using in more so social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes I think yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean now your platform is way bigger
than your city You know, like you got all
[SPEAKER_00]: the drone shots and people are just going
bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean Saber AWR back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did that huge one in LA That was like a
river the Guinness Book of World Records,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's like people are just
constantly trying to go bigger and bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: and scaling way up You know, I think that
is a big factor contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah I'm seeing like people using all
the Rollers like off the freeway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes huge rollers and just am and you know
part of it is like the economics of like
[SPEAKER_00]: just The police don't have time to patrol
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's decriminalized in a way to
worry about Yeah, and so now they just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a free-for-all at least Oakland
Oakland is a free-for-all Oakland is a
[SPEAKER_06]: free-for-all is a free-for-all the trains
are free-for-all over there, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: everything it's Yeah, even back then when
we were doing it there always was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like The hot city that everyone knew that
was like a free-for-all, you know It was
[SPEAKER_00]: New York and then it was Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and different places in San Francisco
for a while and then everything gets
[SPEAKER_00]: locked up and so It was Oakland of it and
then it wasn't Oakland and now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland again You know the last five years
this and like having that having all that
[SPEAKER_00]: space for people to paint You know and
then and then letting when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalized Letting people have time
then the quality goes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now you're seeing a lot of right
when you're not afraid of getting arrested
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're shot or killed or whatever
Although Oakland that you got to watch out
[SPEAKER_06]: Brother stuff, you're not worried about
the police anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're worried about getting shot,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a rough one, you know, it's and it's
sad because I've been around Oakland a
[SPEAKER_06]: long time and it's the worst it's ever
been You know, it was bad back in the day
[SPEAKER_06]: and it got better and now it's bad again
Just you know, they changed the laws and
[SPEAKER_06]: so People don't mind robbing other people
breaking into their cars You can't leave
[SPEAKER_06]: your car parked in Oakland doesn't matter
what your car looks like if there's
[SPEAKER_06]: anything in your car They'll break your
windows and now they have those shattered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah So it like instantly shatters your
window.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're in and out in a second You know
and they have guys driving just down the
[SPEAKER_06]: road looking in every car seeing what they
can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, man Fucking like Wild Wild West
again or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they just don't have enough
police officers to enforce all this stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: Either you know, I mean like the real
criminal you're getting away with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah You say you say out in Oakland too,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but yeah, Oakland, you know,
it's like I don't I try to avoid Oakland
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, honestly, like if I can avoid
Oakland I do But I worked in Oakland my
[SPEAKER_06]: you know on and off my whole life seeing
the growing everything dude Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's and I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you know, I love that Berkeley
Oakland area You know everywhere over
[SPEAKER_06]: there in Oakland Is special, you know
Oakland is different than San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I love San Francisco for its for
its own thing San Francisco is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's there's definitely Diversity
in both places, but they're very unique In
[SPEAKER_06]: their own ways, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I mean this the the pace of life in
San Francisco is like really fast,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little more chill in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think they smoke more weed,
you know Honestly, yeah, so yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's let's dive into talking about
cannabis because this Is mostly a cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: show you know you guys work and I feel
like there's so many parallels to Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: and art.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and street art and the people I think
a lot of guys smoke you used to smoke and
[SPEAKER_02]: don't smoke I used to smoke like heavy
every day just few blunts, you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: just hot box in and I probably smoked for
about like 15 Years like straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I don't know but it got to the
Like we were just always hitting bongs,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever gravity bongs joints and then
just five people rotations hot box in but
[SPEAKER_02]: it got to a point where It was just you
know, like It wasn't fun anymore and it
[SPEAKER_02]: started making me paranoid Oh,
no, you know paranoia start.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a burnout.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay There's a name for you
burnout.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I have a couple front not even a
couple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have lots of friends that have become
burnout Yeah, we're heavy smokers and that
[SPEAKER_06]: they got the paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just I didn't I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know and then plus just smoking
anything now like I'm a little bit shook
[SPEAKER_02]: just cuz my mom passed away from lung
cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, alright, I don't want Any
shit to fuck with my lungs, even though I
[SPEAKER_02]: spray paint, you know, I try to wear the
respirator but a little counterintuitive
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'll mess with like,
you know some CB and little gummies here
[SPEAKER_02]: and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, but I wish though man like
There's so much stuff available right now
[SPEAKER_06]: that one dude the gummies and edibles now
are on a whole different level too as as
[SPEAKER_06]: wild as it is on the graffiti scene and
the street art scene Cannabis and edibles
[SPEAKER_06]: have evolved just as much if not more I
can imagine but rice crispy treats and
[SPEAKER_06]: fruity pebble treats and brownies now they
got 300 different types of treats.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, right drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got infused drinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get a little bit everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we I mean here and there but back in
the day actually that's that's kind of how
[SPEAKER_00]: we met as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Jake Wynn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Wynn He he kind of like linked us
together on the weed tip And so that she
[SPEAKER_00]: actually that might have been my first
time smoking Yeah, yeah, so, I mean we
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I you know, it was fun to like have
the creative side of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just just getting lost in my
drawings and and one thing about smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: and painting You know, we got a but
another buddy Romali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Romali's in illuminaries,
but he kind of like You know when you when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking, you know, there's a
there's a zone We're like where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like a visual thing where like things like
I don't know what it is But your distance
[SPEAKER_00]: changes like things pop out and whatnot
Yeah and so like there there's it does
[SPEAKER_00]: help the painting there was a point in
time where like I felt a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: reliant on it for painting and That kind
of scared me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like why you know, it did help me It
felt me like visualize things and like how
[SPEAKER_00]: about jujitsu?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you rolled high?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the best I have not So you're
messing up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, well, you know when I get
better, you know, that's the way the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, the mother micro mushrooms on
Because well for the competitions my
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin's been recommending me that like
he's like to calm the nerves and all that
[SPEAKER_06]: So when are you in first place?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the mushrooms and then yeah,
I mean I think Israel Adesanya was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about how he does the Mushroom micro doses
training and yeah, I mean, I think there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of benefits to micro dosing even
weed though like micro dosing weed like I
[SPEAKER_06]: think it's a great way when you're
training to Whether it's like lifting
[SPEAKER_06]: weights training jujitsu boxing whatever
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like Even if you don't go the full
Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz style, but even
[SPEAKER_06]: taking one hit it kind of like for me I
don't have to think about what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just flow more It makes me flow more
because I'm one of those people that want
[SPEAKER_06]: really wants to think about what I'm doing
Right training and I feel like it just
[SPEAKER_06]: makes me flow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't honestly experiment with
that too much But I know that the jujitsu
[SPEAKER_00]: community and weed community or the Venn
diagram is very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah But yeah, that's definitely,
you know I love the thing about like the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed the tech Technology there like which
I think is like the whole micro dose idea
[SPEAKER_00]: You know everyone has that experience of
like taking too many brownies or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just like yeah never again,
you know totally and so like having having
[SPEAKER_00]: it now with the gummies where it's like
it's very you can just just a really light
[SPEAKER_00]: dose and you know exactly it's a
consistent experience versus like not
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing if you're gonna be on Mars for a
couple hours So like that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely been a huge innovation in the
industry Yeah control dosing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also specific cannabinoids now
we've got CBD CBG CBN THC there's the
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta 8 the Delta, you know, there's Delta
Delta 9 Delta 10 and we have all these
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids and blending all of them and
finding out what works well for What
[SPEAKER_06]: individual you know, because we all have
different body chemistry So it's really
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing that there's all these things that
you can take and potentially Improve
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever you're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, you know, whether it's sleep or you
know sleep and recovery.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a good one for cannabis,
too I think it's a great way to you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, you know, I think that's the
beauty of it We're also individual with
[SPEAKER_06]: our body chemistries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah that what works for one person might
not work for the next but Sleep especially
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a CBN this CBN and like melatonin
drop Sometimes you know for sleeping that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit works wonders little tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah little tinctures Is there something
better than that like for sleeping like
[SPEAKER_06]: CBN is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think CBN is great and then Just mild
doses of THC too much makes me not want to
[SPEAKER_06]: sleep, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I take the right amount That's what
I like about Delta 8 is where I could pop
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta 8 if I'm tight if what if I want to
be tired Delta 8 are there it's from hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's derived from CBD and they convert it
into Delta 8 and I think there's companies
[SPEAKER_06]: that are doing it right and there's
companies that are doing it wrong But I
[SPEAKER_06]: feel like that's a great one for sleep for
me is that was CBN knocks me out I wake up
[SPEAKER_06]: and if I take the right dose I wake up
super refreshed if I take too much I wake
[SPEAKER_06]: up groggy So it's all about like learning
learning what dose is right for you Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like 50 milligrams of Delta 8 is
really good for me and it's like 20% the
[SPEAKER_06]: strength of Delta 9 THC so it's really
mild and in comparison but And then same
[SPEAKER_06]: thing if you want inflammation CBG is
amazing CBD with CBG is amazing also with
[SPEAKER_06]: THC a which by itself THC a you can eat a
ton of THC a And it doesn't get you high
[SPEAKER_06]: It has anti-inflammatory properties that
with the with the CBG is amazing The
[SPEAKER_06]: second you heat it up, it'll get you
higher than shit, but it turns into a
[SPEAKER_06]: Delta 9 THC, but yeah Just by itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah not let it tap in my guy Eric though
because he's He's a big cannabis fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get so actually before Eric comes
on let's talk about Illuminaries and you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys are a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys are like the hieroglyphics
Shit man, that's that's a big honor right
[SPEAKER_06]: there the hieroglyphics of the the street
art world I don't know about all that But
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys are a group.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's multiple members of the group and
you guys all do projects together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's two of you Sometimes it's
three you sometimes it's everybody right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we have kind of like four Loosely
between like four and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we have like a lot of
other friends that I mean we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: for us like mural art is a social event,
you know, and we love Painting together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so that's we love painting
on the street meeting people and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: more the merrier type thing So there's you
know, there's four of us Steve I'm Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: Romali's in San Diego and then Eric is
here here in the Bay Area as well Well,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're more like the souls of mischief
Because high rows got like 20 guys Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely like another four or
two six people we call on To help on
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I'd say the core is like four
four of us really cool Yeah, let's get
[SPEAKER_06]: Eric on here
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me or having us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah So we got someone who's actually
smoking so we'll smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, we'll start off with some We had
these guests on previously, but this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: the white thorn rose right on from
huckleberry hill farms I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's white thorn rose bird the Rose in
from it is purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, and it's it's I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's unique This is sun-grown flower and I
feel like the effect is super special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could smoke a bunch of it and I'm
not like over-the-top high, but I feel
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking amazing when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Now that's why I always wonder is
like like Wiz Khalifa burner currency How
[SPEAKER_02]: do they smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: All day and then not be tired and and
still perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Like well and function at a high
level taking naps Dab naps or like snooze
[SPEAKER_06]: to like I think taking naps, but also
drinking coffee and it's part of a
[SPEAKER_06]: lifestyle, too So like you get you adapt
to whatever you do, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like smoking I have days where I smoke
all day and I have days where I dab and I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't do that every day and I love doing
it on the show and not every guest like
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking, you know, it's like it's so
individual to your body chemistry and some
[SPEAKER_06]: people man, they could just hang do We had
Freddy Big and he's a he's amazing that
[SPEAKER_06]: dude smoked for an hour straight Literally
did not put the joint down for an hour on
[SPEAKER_06]: the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and not everybody's like that,
you know Snoop Dogg we got yeah Snoop Dogg
[SPEAKER_06]: and be real and Wiz Khalifa, you know,
it's like I mean I'll wake and bake every
[SPEAKER_05]: day but you know, like sometimes I hit
that weed and I get stuck, you know I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: I did I mean it depends on which weed
What's your favorite thing to smoke right
[SPEAKER_05]: now?
[SPEAKER_05]: The big perm Big perm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the perm Clark Clark.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's here Clark.

[SPEAKER_05]: Like his stuff is really good Yeah,
yeah, like so I do I do a lot of his
[SPEAKER_05]: labels and like logos from right now So so
I do a lot of that stuff really cool,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it is his weed is really good Yeah,
this uh, you're passing it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's yes He said not he smells all
right though, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiki right now like that's probably my
favorite After big perm like cuz that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's pretty stony and I'm still
functional, you know Yeah, is that like
[SPEAKER_02]: the hybrids and shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it's more like the indica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's like really purple.

[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really good, too So we need to
get backstory.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're you're the real smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah young smoker Even got a dog named
smokey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you get started in the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it were you an artist as a kid?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like I've been drawing as a kid like
got into graffiti and Junior high when I
[SPEAKER_05]: got this book called spray can art.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was basically like the Bible,
you know, like this other than like subway
[SPEAKER_05]: subway subway or I didn't get that until
like after but like spray can art was like
[SPEAKER_05]: the the book that really got me started
because I was just like flipping through
[SPEAKER_05]: it and I was just just amazed I borrowed
it from my friend like for a whole week
[SPEAKER_05]: and I just studied the whole book You know
like in and out because they just had the
[SPEAKER_05]: layout of like everywhere even like
including San Francisco San Francisco
[SPEAKER_05]: Paris like had they have mo to yeah,
you know crayon was on there like
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody was on that nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean that that's what got me
started
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean like like throughout high school
cuz like I've always like drawn like crazy
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff in my black book Yeah, and everybody
was like, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't even smoke, you know
until like I was probably like what in my
[SPEAKER_05]: 20s like 21 all my homies like like Yeah,
like all my homies was like selling weed
[SPEAKER_05]: or like smoking it like after school or

[SPEAKER_05]: So but now I just smoke every day It goes
well with everything exactly like before a
[SPEAKER_05]: meal after a meal when you wake up before
you go No, I think that the best I love
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking in the morning before you get in
the shower Yeah, yeah, cuz then you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: like if you smoke good before you get in
the shower You take like a bong head or
[SPEAKER_06]: you you know smoking joint or whatever it
is that you do I like going in the shower
[SPEAKER_06]: and that Refreshing feeling and then you
get out of shower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You completely forgot that you smoked and
you think about how wonderful the fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: day is Yeah, I love that I love that
feeling and you know, I don't take I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: get completely ripped in the morning like
I used to but I definitely Take a big hit
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a big two foot bong glass bong or
like one and a half foot glass bong and I
[SPEAKER_06]: take a nice hit out of that and But that
shower in the morning is always great.

flyers every once in a while, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like there were just so many parties
Bro, your your stack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my stack is probably like this this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the flyers I saved Yeah,

[SPEAKER_06]: someone made a book of flyers I didn't
contribute any of mine to the book or
[SPEAKER_06]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I feel like I could make my own book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'd be cool publish that dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the art was just Incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, owen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you remember owen who did
the art back in the day This was a very
[SPEAKER_06]: specific style.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was like almost abstract
characters that were all stretched out and
[SPEAKER_06]: Really really basic.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, there was some good stuff back
in the day like yeah, I was like Tim,
[SPEAKER_02]: what were they using back there like 3d
programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were oh no, it was the photoshop
filters Filter the shit out of it just
[SPEAKER_02]: like mad fractals and layers and yeah all
that That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's funny how we've evolved from
the 90s if you really kind of dive into
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we were then and how we are now and
yeah, we don't have raves because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like just like disco once it's gone It'll
never be the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we can always try to redo it drum and
bass is another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually like drum I didn't like it back
then I didn't like those rooms where it
[SPEAKER_06]: was like Like it was just too aggressive
for me I was like into more the the mellow
[SPEAKER_06]: vibe and I feel like some of those drum
and bass where it was like Like they they
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking they'll build it up and they'll
drop it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay It's got it's got a lot of
energy and like good vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good energy and some of the stuff
was kind of dark back in the day It was
[SPEAKER_05]: cool when they had live performers to you
know, like oh, yeah the emcees dancing
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you guys ever get a burning man.
[SPEAKER_05]: No you oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Like one of the things I am on my
bucket list Like is it commercialized?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I went back with way before it was
commercialized.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe it's commercialized now and
stuff They got people flying in airplanes
[SPEAKER_06]: into it and helicopters.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I went Almost 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: What Wow, okay I went in 96 Was it was it
free and like you just drive in it wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: free, but we had a guy that paid for all
of us Okay, we went in an RV with a bunch
[SPEAKER_06]: of guys and we had amazing time and it was
Black Rock Desert and there was Mud
[SPEAKER_06]: Springs, but there was also the camps back
and there was astral matrix had his own
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking camp and it was like dude the just
the DJs were amazing back then and It just
[SPEAKER_06]: the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure it's amazing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been in a long time You ever
feel like going to Coachella So for me
[SPEAKER_06]: it's that's not my vibe and there's
nothing wrong with it and maybe I will go
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not one of those people who will count
it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but as far as like the experience
I would rather go to reggae in the river.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and go see Marlon sing up there this
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah Are you gonna go?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to reggae the reggae scene and
there was a lot of crossover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah maritime hall back in the Maritime
Hall that was
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a little bit of everything like I
saw the black eyed peas like I remember
[SPEAKER_05]: When they were hip-hop like yeah,
they had the the van all rap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just three of them without Fergie
Dude the roots long before the Jimmy
[SPEAKER_06]: Fallon show the roots played there and
yeah way back in the day Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, man Maritime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw rock him there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a bunch of people there Yeah,
so much amazing talent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the Bay Area is just Filled with
places to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah do you know as far as like if you're
into culture and you're into the scene
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the Bay Area has so much to
offer doesn't matter what it is There's a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit everything there is punk and
ska exactly up and all that There's a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole scene for that, you know,
and it's like and one of the biggest and
[SPEAKER_06]: the best I mean, yeah, that's the beauty
of big cities too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like they they have this culture
There's like this magnetism that draws
[SPEAKER_05]: people together from exactly exactly cuz
well cuz I'm originally from Sacramento
[SPEAKER_05]: and I used to just come to the Bay Area
All the time just just for you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: for the hell of it, you know, it was
always a shitty raves I remember going
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a few good ones Okay,
yeah, they were out there but damn those
[SPEAKER_02]: tribes were wild bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't even did we even get home
you don't Seriously, no, we were we were
[SPEAKER_06]: always into driving home for whatever he's
so stupid, you know, but but anything
[SPEAKER_06]: about that when you're younger and This is
like my mid mid teens to middle 18.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know like from I think 14 or 15
I was probably 15 the first real party I
[SPEAKER_06]: went to my buddy Scott Kirby back in the
day He dragged us into all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking get really good dude amazing guy
But and he used to throw parties to in
[SPEAKER_06]: like the Pleasant Hill Walnut Creek
conquered So there was one in Pittsburgh
[SPEAKER_06]: he threw a Pittsburgh
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude simply Jeff was so sick from LA and
he I can't remember his roommates name,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he did those guys were so It's so
funny you guys are the same age I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: messing up what we're messing up all their
mic levels No change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's simply Jeff was so sick though
Like yeah, and there's a bunch of guys
[SPEAKER_06]: that were just so talented music wise and
that was before the real big money Right
[SPEAKER_06]: before it became I mean there was some of
those guys DJ Dan was killing it back in
[SPEAKER_06]: the day Donald Glod Yeah, those guys were
making money back in the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: those guys were making millions but they
also had crazy work ethics and those dudes
[SPEAKER_06]: would just yeah work and You know,
and then now we have Steve Aoki who's
[SPEAKER_06]: badass Super fucking crazy does his thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Steve Aoki's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah He's making like rock star money
straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, music money.
[SPEAKER_06]: No cakes that people That's why that yeah,
I saw him in Vegas not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun We must have been in the same
room at least a dozen times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, but Brian was saying we got to
do a jitsu match during this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was his request.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hilarious Yeah, no game.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're going right now Yeah,
he's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've known Bryant for a really long time
Like I remember Brian when he was two
[SPEAKER_06]: hundred and he I think he was close to
three.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was 290 You know, this was like
offseason.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he was bulking bodybuilder dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's amazing bodybuilder, you know Shout
out to all the guys at Saber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they were jiu-jitsu EBA a new
creations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes Do miles dude, no Big Joe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, how long you been doing jiu-jitsu?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember your first experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like and why you got hooked Or do
you need do you remember the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were you like damn this is badass?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean I so I trained it the I mean
a different it so before when I was
[SPEAKER_06]: wrestling I wrestled in high school a
little bit and Then over at Dragon House
[SPEAKER_06]: in San Francisco before it was Dragon
House It was white dragon and we did
[SPEAKER_06]: grappling and we did some some Mongolian
wrestling and some grappling and takedowns
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff like that and There was a lot of
fun, but it was also a kung fu school at
[SPEAKER_06]: the time And then I always wanted to get
into it, but I didn't really Want to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: another school because I felt like it was
abandoning my original school So I didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: I held out on changing jiu-jitsu like
another jiu-jitsu school because I felt
[SPEAKER_06]: obligated to this Kung fu school that I
was at like but I went to train somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: else it would be bad like right not what
you did back in the day or yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought was Necessary right and it's
still a thing now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it is weird But I think it's a
little bit a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_06]: but then Brian the first day I chained
there like I thought I was tough and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was so humbling the first day and it was a
small group of guys and You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Pretty pretty skilled guys and
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think I was so unskilled They
were just so much better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you hadn't been doing jiu-jitsu,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay You know, it's like I could fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could fight then you realize how
Ineffective everything you thought was
[SPEAKER_06]: effective or thought would be effective Is
unless you're some badass you're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: your ego is gonna get broken real quick
Jiu-jitsu is so beautiful because you
[SPEAKER_06]: really learn who you are, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like a lot of times we have these false
Senses of who we are we think we're this
[SPEAKER_06]: person because we have this ego,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so unless you do psychedelics or
jiu-jitsu, you know, you you build these
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you but that's that's like
breaking those barriers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really learn who you are, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the beauty of jiu-jitsu for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also the beauty of psychedelics
It's like you you realize how the world
[SPEAKER_06]: really is because a lot of times people
