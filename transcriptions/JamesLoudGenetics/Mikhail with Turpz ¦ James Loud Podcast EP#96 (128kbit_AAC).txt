Let's get started!
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, our special guest is Mikhail
from Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's shaking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been an adventurous week,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the second podcast we're doing
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when I saw you in Alameda.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were, I think, building or getting
this place into action or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny how long it takes to get there,
because that was like three years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, that we were together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had to be over three years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we've known each other for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually were part of the same circle
of friends and didn't hang out,
[SPEAKER_04]: but kind of knew of each other for the
last 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the same mutual friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we hung out in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, five years ago or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw you also in Spain at Spannibus
the past two years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we've just been chilling,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trying to take it easy, relax,
not really overwork myself, which we've
[SPEAKER_07]: all been used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it's like you might not be
successful unless you overwork yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think working hard is part of the
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you believe in yourself and you believe
in your product, I think that goes a long
[SPEAKER_04]: ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it gives you something to strive
for every day when you can be devoted to
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's part of what we do is we
become devotional.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you can be devoted to your craft,
that's when it can really take off and
[SPEAKER_04]: almost have a mind of its own.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's also your heart's got to be
there now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be there because the amount of
effort that you're putting to get to where
[SPEAKER_07]: you're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, if your heart's not there,
it's going to be a struggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you really have to love what you
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to love what you do to a degree
and believe in yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these days, people don't believe
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to believe stuff when people
are struggling so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard for them to believe anything,
believe in anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry has had its ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a roller coaster, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be bad times and good
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be good, and it's going to
be bad, and then it's going to be good
[SPEAKER_04]: again, and then it's probably going to be
a little bad again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like I'm on this upward
trajectory, and I'm excited about the
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the stuff you're doing in Portugal
with our good friend Pauly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pauly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Pauly, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of my best friends in the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was my sous chef for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did cooking stuff together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just an amazing human.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys are working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought him over to Portugal on the
project that you were doing, and I think
[SPEAKER_07]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also was speaking to Red on the way down
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he sends his hellos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing some mushroom stuff back in
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's been doing that for a while
with Tony, and they've been doing some
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to clinical trials now in
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he's been pushing the bar ever
since I've known him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with mushrooms, like him and Tony
have really kind of been doing wild
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when people were just first
starting to talk about it, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about taking it to that next
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have so many friends that are really
interesting, that really are outside the
[SPEAKER_04]: box thinkers, that kind of are innovators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when Pauly was telling me about
your vape cart that you're coming out
[SPEAKER_04]: with, I was like, man, I don't really have
vape cart guys on the show, but you're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing something super innovative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like we have so many other
great stories to talk about that it would
[SPEAKER_04]: make for a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's with genetics or whatever it
is in this space, innovation is so
[SPEAKER_04]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you tell everybody about your
device?
[SPEAKER_07]: So date back to like, I think it was 2016,
2017.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were growing up in Leytonville.
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought all the flour down and we dried
it and froze it and we processed it into
[SPEAKER_07]: sauce and diamonds at the lab in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you really got in front of HTE
and saw what you could do, with the full
[SPEAKER_07]: terp spectrum, it's kind of like,
holy shit, because most of the vape carts
[SPEAKER_07]: back then on the market were all hot dog
water with botanical terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a monetary play there and not
something that's like grade A for the
[SPEAKER_07]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, when you're looking at the
elite cultivators, the elite
[SPEAKER_07]: manufacturers, these guys are trying to
keep a top tier product at a market
[SPEAKER_07]: competitive cost because price and its
quality, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was that heyday of just like,
okay, all these trash five, 10 threads are
[SPEAKER_07]: all going to wherever and people who knows
what they're ingesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of times you get a market
segment that doesn't, they're not educated
[SPEAKER_07]: in it because nobody's taking the time to
educate them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, okay, so this is how they
make that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember walking into warehouses that
only sold V8.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of like, nobody knows what they
have to do to get this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not going to tell them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just going to kind of listen and
leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that year on that hill, we came down,
we did all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just sparked in my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, why isn't there a cartridge for
specifically the diamonds and the sauce?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you fast forward, you know,
now six years later, people are decarbing
[SPEAKER_07]: the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're putting the HD back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're separating it, reformulating it,
or they're taking live resin and decarbing
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's definitely a higher level of
quality coming out from an extraction
[SPEAKER_07]: formulation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you really break it down into the
active compounds, your THCA or your THC is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to need a certain level of
temperature to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you bring the flavonoid and the
terpene in there with it, you're cooking
[SPEAKER_07]: it because that doesn't need those
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can get into the deeper science
about the volatile and the heating curve
[SPEAKER_07]: to actually vaporize the volatiles instead
of evaporate them, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I did six years ago is I started
down a path of creating what essentially
[SPEAKER_07]: is a dual chamber cartridge with a battery
that is rechargeable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was thinking to myself, how do we
make this even more preferable besides
[SPEAKER_07]: splitting the active compounds?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's like, supposing you wake up
tomorrow and you don't want to,
[SPEAKER_07]: to smoke the certain strain of that vape
cart that you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_07]: You buy 13 vape carts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you wake up, you can appease
yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my engineers like, unfortunately,
yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my engineers like, listen,
I can make that terp tank swappable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it kind of went from here to here
in my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like with our, with our pods,
our base system, you'd go to a dispensary
[SPEAKER_07]: and you would get the THCA pod,
which contains the diamonds, non-decarved.
[SPEAKER_07]: They sit in crystalline form.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't essentially fool a customer and
say it's liquid diamonds, but it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: just hot dog water, which, you know,
that's, that's a lot of the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: standard, almost unfortunately,
you know, distillates, distillate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It got a lot of people through some hard
times, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_07]: is it like, is it full spectrum office?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to go straight or are you
going to be able to sell something like
that, like, everything from the,
because that's how it's going to work,
that's the raw product.
And that's, that's what's, it's going to
make a difference, it's getting the,
that's what's going to be the,
that's the real psychic power of the
concept of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, well, we've jumped down a
little, like a little too far off of the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant and everything now, because you're
cooking everything off in the Roto.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now you've got to bring the
flavonoid back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I met with some other companies,
which I won't name, but and this was back
[SPEAKER_07]: in 2017, but everybody wanted to use HTE.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted to use the terpene that was
native to the plant, but cost
[SPEAKER_07]: effectiveness and then amount that you
need to formulate with times that price
[SPEAKER_07]: program to get the same pungency,
the same taste that you were getting by
[SPEAKER_07]: adding the botanicals at whatever 7%,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Those botanicals go a long way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, it just wasn't, it took them out of
a market of competitive, market
[SPEAKER_07]: competitive price point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you can be market competitive with
it because obviously the industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we started working on the UI for the
battery and we have a chip inside that
[SPEAKER_07]: essentially it's an OEM chip that we had
designed specifically for our device in
[SPEAKER_07]: which you throwing a certain temperature
at the diamonds and a certain temperature
[SPEAKER_07]: at the sauce.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're able to create a heat curve for
the sauce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which will ramp it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you actually vaporize the volatiles
that are left there, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: using fresh frozen sauce, which is what we
have in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You, the point of the frozen is the stuff
that goes missing during the drying and
[SPEAKER_07]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those volatile compounds that just
disappear, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're going to probably,
if you're going to harvest in that manner
[SPEAKER_07]: and process in that manner, you might as
well want to taste it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you don't just want to cook
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could throw fresh frozen and distill
it in a single chamber.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you want to taste as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you want it to taste different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's the thing that,
that it was like in my head, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_07]: okay, this is going to get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the THCA is very potent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's isolated.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is the, the Terps,
everybody chases the Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people chase Terpians in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I love this sushi spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or this, this Mexican moonshine is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so people chase Terps and don't even
realize it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with cannabis, it's like, Oh,
what's the new candy strain?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you're chasing the Terps.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have a hundred percent,
you know, THC potency to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't change anything in terms of a
quality standpoint.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a nostalgic standpoint, you don't crack
a turkey and just look to see how icy it
[SPEAKER_07]: is.
[SPEAKER_07]: You crack a turkey and you're trying to
get the smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to, okay, this, this smells like
cotton candy skittles, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's what they say it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, how do we bring that to the
consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all my friends on the East coast,
everybody that has shops and everybody is
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of like in that, you know,
up and coming market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, you get the same
response for people that go from like
[SPEAKER_07]: flower to vapes and stuff where it's kind
of like, yeah, it tastes good,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's like, not like I couldn't,
it says skittles on it, but I can't really
[SPEAKER_07]: pinpoint.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't taste the skittles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad trim Terps, you know, again,
you know, it's just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of going the quick and fast and
easy route, like how do you make this like
[SPEAKER_07]: top tier, but still keep it market
competitive from a price point,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're able to introduce the ability for
the user on the screen to highlight either
[SPEAKER_07]: the diamond or the sauce icon and change
the intensity of either side to your
[SPEAKER_07]: desired preference.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you want it to be more
intense on your THC, you can up that.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want it to be more flavorful and
less intense, you can balance it to your
[SPEAKER_07]: preference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, with the simple turn and a
pull, you can just drop in whatever Terp
[SPEAKER_07]: tank you want for that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very user friendly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very, uh, advantageous to somebody
who, you know, I, when I see this,
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes I think of like, uh,
like a mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of three kids that can't just like step
out and roll a joint and like sit there
[SPEAKER_07]: and come back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of like, okay, this is some
issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's done, you know, she's high and
nobody's like, you reek like we mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the biggest advantage of carts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't smell like flour and like burnt
flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, you know, with,
with the market maturing across America
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, to some degree,
you know, Europe and other places in the
[SPEAKER_07]: world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get this type of
necessity.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're going to have people that
are going to look at this and be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: okay, that's awesome because I work in
some company and I have to go to the
[SPEAKER_07]: bathroom and I want to take a fucking head
of this while I'm sitting on the bathroom
[SPEAKER_07]: toilet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I go back to work, you know,
you can't really go out front of the
[SPEAKER_07]: building and pull out a backwards and
start rolling up and then go back and your
[SPEAKER_07]: boss is like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and this is just the truth of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people look for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things to escape or make their real world
easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't necessarily want to risk
what they have by doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love flower, but you had to bring,
if you're going to come to market in my
[SPEAKER_07]: mind with something, why not it be
something novel, something that pushes the
[SPEAKER_07]: envelope a little bit, something that
takes the science of the plant and
[SPEAKER_07]: actually uses that science to benefit the
customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the overall experience, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just not much these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I showed it to a few guys,
few operators that are like within the
[SPEAKER_07]: extract space and the vape space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were like, finally something
that's different, something that makes a
[SPEAKER_07]: change in the experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was everything besides that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, you know, making sure we're with
the right manufacturers in China,
[SPEAKER_07]: making sure that coming to market,
we have full quality control.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going out in the field from a
strain standpoint, making sure that the
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction lab and it's the same guys that
I, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Was working with back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a very good relationship.
[SPEAKER_07]: The guys that a one you've met Jordan and
Mike before.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so it's like, I'm comfortable
with who's in the supply chain from that
[SPEAKER_07]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: At that point, you know, it's just money
and, and, and, and heart, like we said,
[SPEAKER_07]: like if your heart's behind it and you
think that this is a better product,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got some sort of work ethic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta have a little something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta have a little something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about terpenes for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I feel like we can educate everybody
on terpenes because not all terpenes are
[SPEAKER_04]: created equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have native terpenes, which are
basically native to that distillate or to
[SPEAKER_04]: those diamonds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're talking about native and then
there's cannabis derived terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which are cannabis as opposed to botanical
or plant derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the the artificial
terpenes, which are made in a lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have these three or four categories
of terpenes that people are using and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're definitely not all created equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis derived or native terpenes,
depending on what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: are typically a lot more expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're harder to extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically they're separated with cold
extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: From a hydrocarbon stance, you are pushing
solvent through the material.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're crashing at a low temp to
purge the solvent and create the
[SPEAKER_07]: crystalline formulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're fractioning them,
separating them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're again, finaling,
finalizing the purge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're, you're filling and
supplying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been obviously looking at the
solventless methods with the right
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics, obviously, because rosin and the
solventless thing is is super genetic
[SPEAKER_07]: based for being profitable or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think with the right genetics and the
right mechanical separations, which I've
[SPEAKER_07]: seen them do, you know, like the reroll
wands of the A that come from rosin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think I have a method that you
can do your initial squeeze, your 24 hour,
[SPEAKER_07]: your whip and your cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think that there's a way
mechanically with head pressure and vacuum
[SPEAKER_07]: through a filtration column.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That you could separate the two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there you have your A,
maybe you got a centrifuge it just to get
[SPEAKER_07]: any remaining leftover turp off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can reformulate that into
micro diamonds with silicone molds and low
[SPEAKER_07]: temps in back ovens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now essentially here's your solventless
diamond and here's your solventless sauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the guy for that actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Kenny from Trichome
Technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's anybody that can figure it out,
it's him or he's probably already figured
[SPEAKER_04]: it out, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sit around and I think about that
because there's a bigger market segment.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a bigger vantage point of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the way that information
transfers across America, like there was a
[SPEAKER_07]: time where the other coast had no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't know what passers were.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know what passers are now.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know what rosin is now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You start to see the education roll
downhill to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's like, you know, I don't want
to be that company that didn't do their
[SPEAKER_07]: due diligence to be able to supply this to
them in a solventless fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's what the buyer wants,
you make the customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We spent all this time and energy and
effort to make something, to make the
[SPEAKER_07]: customer happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to see that all the way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a fully customizable
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can take it in any direction you
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want higher terpenes and what kind of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think that the
possibility is a pretty much endless with
[SPEAKER_04]: which direction you can go as a consumer,
which is nice because as a company,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can offer all these great packages and
great concepts for people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, going in, going into a dispense
area, you know, you buy the diamonds and
[SPEAKER_07]: then you get an array of Terp tanks to
choose from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's like, okay,
I'll take these three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and technically Terps can be shipped
in the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could even have them on your
website.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little farm bill action for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, what's nice about Terps,
too, and having, you know, jars of them
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting is that you can, it's like,
there's, it's like a cheat code to
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding to a degree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's like, let's say we're like,
okay, let's just play around and make some
[SPEAKER_07]: cocktails.
[SPEAKER_07]: 10% of this, 10% of this, 80% of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, you know, you, you obviously
know, like when you're doing your,
[SPEAKER_07]: your breeding, like you're looking for
the, the Terps to this is checking on the
box.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to get an idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't always work out like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of, you know, that's the funny thing
with breeding though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pencil it out and it doesn't look the
same on paper as it does in reality a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the future of rosin is blending
just like they blend wine, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think also blending Terps together
in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can get some really cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a lot of, you know, I think hash
holes is a great example.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are trying to combine a certain
type of rosin with a certain type of flour
[SPEAKER_04]: to get a certain type of flavor and
effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's the same thing with the pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're exploring these areas because I feel
like we got to leave no stone left
[SPEAKER_04]: unturned to a degree, especially in this
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so many different directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go right when you think you've got
it all figured out something new emerges.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what like vape cartridge is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I got my heiress from focus
V and this is my dab rig that I carry
[SPEAKER_04]: around in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love this, but I'm all about
innovation and I'm all about switching
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's so many different
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love it all because I'm all about
the experience too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the experiences we can have in life
and all these different experiences and
[SPEAKER_04]: where we can go with a pen where I don't
want to get super big, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: feel like smoking and having some Terps in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, that's great to be able
to choose, you know, in the morning you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the gym.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to get that ripped,
but you want to get just right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to get comfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing is like the industry
is, is still full of our, our generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And age, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, if we gave up, if we threw
the towel in, you know, we're burnt.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been at this a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone else is going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about this younger generation
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my doubts and fears, you know,
but I still see people emerging that are
[SPEAKER_04]: creative and innovative.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much the younger guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's more the corporations and the
guys that, you know, money solves
[SPEAKER_07]: problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, to a degree you see science.
[SPEAKER_07]: Scientists now come on and the guy may
have never smoked weed before,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he might be like, well, why are we
doing it like this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause the boiling points here are lower
than here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's, you need that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for it to push the ball forward,
if it comes from us, we're still doing our
[SPEAKER_07]: job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like to hand the accolade to them,
to me, we're not doing our job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody, nobody wants to hear the opinion
of some brand new fresh out of the gate
[SPEAKER_07]: guy on his podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: People come here because you're a very
well-respected long-term in this industry
[SPEAKER_07]: guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: People come here because you are you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking to James, you know,
I'm not talking to John from super science
[SPEAKER_07]: tech.com that just got their permit two
years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: They still think Gorilla Glue is the best
thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love Gorilla Glue, but you
understand what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the dated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to love hate relationship with that
girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: When Red grew it in Auroville,
like I just remember being like,
[SPEAKER_07]: what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when he just replaced sour
diesel almost completely overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there was like the sour craze
and all my friends that were growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: all our friends that were growing sour and
all of a sudden everybody's growing
[SPEAKER_04]: Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Gorilla Glue was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like it kind of just stepped on
sour right at the end there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was gassy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It checks the, basically it checks the
boxes for the same boxes that sour diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: checks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of people were like,
well, I'm just going to grow this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It finishes faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to worry about the rain at
the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: The yields are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The buds dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bag of peel was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had better structure than sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't such a pain in the ass to
grow like sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd have, you'd look at sour wrong
and all of a sudden it fingers out
[SPEAKER_04]: completely and you got fox tails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were good times though.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, sour kind of built our group
of friends too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sour and our relationship with sour
and chem dog and, you know, Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonoma, Humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like within our circle of friends,
that kind of built our group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Gorilla Glue comes in and frickin
basically Gorilla Glue kind of took over
[SPEAKER_04]: for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: It did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was kind of like, it would,
it had that trajectory that dream had,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, cause it was like people are
like, oh, this fucking thing yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a wonderful TURP content.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, let's just- Dream was good too
at one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't remember it,
but dream was the one that literally Blue
[SPEAKER_04]: Dream when it peaked, it peaked.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were like tripping on how good it
was too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was sticky and it had the bag of
peel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were so many good things about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The effect maybe wasn't there for
everybody, but as far as bag of peel,
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Dream was where it was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was some of the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was definitely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just back to like the importance
of the turpene and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you think about it from an industry
standard where they're like, ah,
[SPEAKER_07]: sprayed packs, sprayed packs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what the fuck are they spraying it
with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Turpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether they're native or not or
artificial or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not justifying the actions.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not saying that this is right,
but I'm just saying this is what they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing from a mechanical level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they are trying to increase the
turpene content.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it pops, it jumps, because when you're
rolling and it's loud, this is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: get me lit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this, it's just the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're smoking it through a backwoods
and it still tastes all turpy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's part of the
appeal of the turped flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not judging.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like it, you like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't, you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my thing really.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also understand its value for
certain demographics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you look at it from that
perspective and yeah, it is, people chase
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, there's flavor
chasers all over with everything in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with ours, it's like I've met with a
few people that kind of like they didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: nudge me, but they kind of like laid out a
portfolio of companies that they could
[SPEAKER_07]: feed the hardware to just solely the
hardware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem in my mind, which is
giving this out as hardware or doing that
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of thing is like you lose control
over the QC of what inputs end up in
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I want to come out to market with the
brand right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is it, is it, you know,
a heavy load to bear on like just life?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, like we're talking about a
lot of work, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I were to just go that route and
just be like, okay, we'll sell hardware to
[SPEAKER_07]: a thousand different companies,
a thousand times over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're putting B grade fucking turps
in and it's just not like this tech cannot
[SPEAKER_07]: be an experience that a single chamber
trim turped hot dog water cart would give
[SPEAKER_07]: you because it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why all the this and this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you going to jump through these
hoops?
[SPEAKER_07]: If at the end of the day, the experience
is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our thing is like, get the couple of
acres, grab this frozen or dry cured
[SPEAKER_06]: immediately frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another thing we'll talk about
next, but bring.
[SPEAKER_07]: The quality of the technology and match it
to the quality of the experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, then you take it from our
standpoint where it's like guys love
[SPEAKER_07]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of those volatiles and it's like,
you know, we know what wet sour smells
[SPEAKER_07]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you have a hundred thousand
cartridges on rec to consumers that have
[SPEAKER_07]: never walked through a field and indoor or
anything before in their life,
[SPEAKER_07]: never grown a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That wet may not be that nostalgic
reminder of that strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were to dry the flower,
freeze it, process it, those turps are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be eye to eye with the dried
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cryo cure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, or any, I mean, just cryo technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard about that where they're like,
where they're changing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in my opinion, it's like, and I had
this discussion with someone somebody
[SPEAKER_07]: today, like, is it smarter to appeal to
the, to the guys like us, or is it smarter
[SPEAKER_07]: to appeal for the common person that may
have experienced these same strains and
[SPEAKER_07]: flower so that when they hit it,
they realize that, oh my God, that tastes
[SPEAKER_07]: like I stuck my face in a bag of blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like you're, you're,
you're smoking the smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, at the end of the day,
it's like, that's, you have to sometimes
[SPEAKER_07]: not think about you or your peers or the
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to just solely base your
trajectory and your roadmap and how you're
[SPEAKER_07]: formulating your inputs on the buyer,
on the consumer, on the person that's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to leave that Yelp review.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's that ultimate
experience too, that you can provide that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what it'll set you apart from
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can provide an experience that's
different, that's better, that sticks with
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can get people's head and they're
like, wow, that's the best thing I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: tasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're onto something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, that's, that's what it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're a breeder, whether you're
making extract, whether you're making
[SPEAKER_04]: extract equipment, it's all about chasing
flavor and giving people and chasing
[SPEAKER_04]: experiences, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, if you can give this,
I mean, same thing with breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can create a new variety that's
different from everything else everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: has, it's not just a derivative of all
this other stuff, but that's actually a
[SPEAKER_04]: new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're onto something special.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you think of it from an environmental
standpoint, like, you know, you see these
[SPEAKER_07]: states, California cracking down on how
you're disposing of the lithium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you see them cracking down on the
flavors people are using.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, you can't really use all this
artificial shit here anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's not good for people.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of this has been clinically trialed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't see what's happening to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: No more menthol cigarettes, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, shout out all my Newport
smokers, but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like at the end of the day, it's,
you know, if you can buy a battery and
[SPEAKER_07]: recharge the battery and not be,
you know, a waste on the environment for
[SPEAKER_07]: lithium, like why not?
[SPEAKER_07]: If the tech is there, why not just use it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because at the end of the day,
waste is waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, lithium's a you can't just
like throw it in the landfill and things
[SPEAKER_07]: can happen in mass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the same thing with the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like at least you and I know we've
been smoking flour forever and all this
[SPEAKER_07]: comes from that same flower smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we don't have to be like,
is this mysterious to my body or not?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this is what.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what cannabis is like,
where you legalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's pushing for the motion of the
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's looking at it from a
countrywide scale now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like businesses are
companies are putting their projections.
[SPEAKER_07]: In front of them, like if this were to
happen, this is where we would be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would you need to do anything else?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many people that haven't even
just experienced the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you need to substitute that with
weirdo shit?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because it lowers your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, some people are super
fucking greedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people don't care about whether or
not they're doing this or that to the to
[SPEAKER_07]: their consumer because it meets their
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: They meet their P&L sheet looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're perform on my this, my that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You and I both know like.
[SPEAKER_07]: The essence of this starting off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, there's money to be made.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was always money to be made,
but there was a brotherhood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was a I'm selling this and
doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, our friends are kind of different
because we were all about quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanted the best shit possible and we
didn't give a fuck about price.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always about having the very best
of the very best.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we always fought for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was always that strive to for
greatness, you know, with everything that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've always done with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just saw much happiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: It brought normal people that like had
access in 2002 to a bag of good weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, yeah, they had a stressful
day at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to go home and smoke a bowl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's an eighth for 60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's this Durbin poison from fucking
honeydew.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some top shelf, some top shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like that happiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was a motivator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you almost can't put a price on an
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can, but you almost can't
put a price on an experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, cause those are like,
especially some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like batch to batch craft flour that
we had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just like some of the stuff
coming out was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the stuff where people were like,
oh, Durbin poison, for instance,
[SPEAKER_04]: people like, oh, Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the Durbin poison that was going
around back in the day, completely
[SPEAKER_04]: different, completely different than it is
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a, it wasn't very hazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was super funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incensey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, haze was, maybe there was a little
bit of haze, but it was more so the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cherry, anise and funk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also the structure of it back then,
it was like appealing from a structural,
[SPEAKER_07]: like a color structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, it was just bright orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, some people don't like the hairs
because they cover up the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I love good Durbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those African land race varieties
that we got that were closer to the land
[SPEAKER_04]: race and what it really was than these
watered down versions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a lot of times today, you know,
the red Congolese, the Malawi and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Durbin, those were the three special
things that we kind of saw in the Bay
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all of them for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Durbin was super strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent dig in the dirt,
but like having, having that impact on
[SPEAKER_07]: someone's life to like, let them reset for
the next day or let them help them get
[SPEAKER_07]: through their day or that was a motivating
factor for me because like, if you ran the
[SPEAKER_07]: gamut back then, the money was guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like theory of doing art or
music is like, you do it for the passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do what you love and the money will
come, you know, money's not the first
[SPEAKER_04]: priority.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a devotional thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talk about it on the show about
devotional arts and cannabis now has
[SPEAKER_04]: turned into a devotional thing too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like art where you basically do the best
you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it out in the world and if the
world loves it, you know, you win,
[SPEAKER_04]: but either way you loved creating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's a different world now with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it was like, pretty much you could
grow mids and you could be successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot grow middle grade cannabis as a
small producer and expect to be
[SPEAKER_04]: successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will fail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very difficult fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extremely hard, you know, coming online,
you think cannabis is going to be easy
[SPEAKER_04]: money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, it's devotional.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, it takes eating,
sleeping and breathing what you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: to be successful these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's the beauty and the curse of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's beautiful in some ways,
some of these people and how they're
[SPEAKER_04]: devoted and some of our friends and how
they're devoted to what they do,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and even Polly, for instance,
when he was growing flour in California,
[SPEAKER_04]: his flour was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: His, his a greenhouse flower that he was
doing was as good as a lot of indoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was top shelf greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the way he grew it, the way he
harvested it, trimmed it, dried it,
[SPEAKER_04]: cured it and stored it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all those components.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adding up to this amazing, beautiful
product, you know, and it's, it's great
[SPEAKER_04]: when we have people like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more motivating for me being
around people that are like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, now it is what it is and it
has its goods and its bads.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we could sit here and
probably complain more now than we could
[SPEAKER_07]: applause, but we're still going to stay
here and we're still going to push the
[SPEAKER_07]: ball forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, at the end of the day,
this is, this is what we came here to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just got to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: See it through.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you just have to see it through,
but unfortunately like life's getting
[SPEAKER_07]: strangely expensive everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, I don't think it's actually more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think the dollar's worth less than
it used to be either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes deeper in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what price of flour has
definitely gone down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the value of it has gone down compared
to what it was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you look at the 4,000 or a pound
for 20 years ago, that would actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you have 10 X on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's $40,000 for that same pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not 10 X, maybe it's five,
but $20,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's keep it at 10 X.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we start talking like that,
where they got $4,000 a pound,
[SPEAKER_04]: not only do they get $4,000 a pound,
but the dollar was so much stronger than
[SPEAKER_04]: now that $4,000 a pound is 10,
20, 30, 40, whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_04]: number you want to play.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could probably do the math and come up
with some real factual numbers where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, shit, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause now that pound, that's $300 for that
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at it from years ago,
that's only worth like $50.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: $50 from the nineties or early two
thousands, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No one was, you know, one would take $50
for a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no one selling $50 pounds in the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We live in wild times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three and a half grams is 50 bucks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even for the Mexican, it was like,
you might get an ounce for 50 bucks if you
[SPEAKER_04]: were lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was typically a hundred and ounce for
Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause the pounds would be like anywhere
from five to eight, depending where you
[SPEAKER_07]: were at on the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, if you're paying that,
or maybe it was cheaper in bulk and SoCal,
[SPEAKER_07]: but like I wasn't trapping when I was 14
sending Mexican around.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just remember seeing it on the East
coast and in high school, like 160 bucks
[SPEAKER_07]: an ounce, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like, it's never been this low
if you, chop it down into numbers price
[SPEAKER_07]: per gram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never been this cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add inflation.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's so funny though, is when you're
dealing with real estate agents and these
[SPEAKER_07]: corporate jackoffs like out East and
you're trying to, let's say secure a
[SPEAKER_07]: facility to build a grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause for example, I got the social equity
permits in Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the whole vertical integration
permits from the fed case that I went
[SPEAKER_07]: through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, yeah, if you've had a
can of charge and you live in DC,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you can apply.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was in town.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironically, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a buddy that had some real estate,
signed my name, changed the driver's
[SPEAKER_07]: license, filled out the apps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next thing you know, I have these permits.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay, let's knock on some doors
and see from a real estate perspective,
[SPEAKER_07]: what's out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it'll be like, oh yeah,
online.
[SPEAKER_05]: It says 1750 a square foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing in there?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, yo, we have a cultivation
license.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'd like to build a, a medical
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the price per square foot is now 2750.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, yeah, all these people from
a corporate standpoint that are detached
[SPEAKER_07]: from the industry, they hear it and they
automatically think that these guys are
[SPEAKER_05]: printing money.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we can squeeze them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's the cannabis tax and it's you
get taxed on every level from everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: all over with, you know, cannabis hemp,
whatever, all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always that cannabis plus tax.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, like nobody has released a
documentary or something that at least
[SPEAKER_07]: shows the world where it started up here
and where it's, you know, ended at in
[SPEAKER_07]: today's, you know, footprint.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I think that there needs to be some
sort of mainstream with a Netflix or
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: There needs to be something that shows the
truth from camp all the way down to now,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the pirates like the McDonald's
documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not super high me, but what are the
supersize me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super high.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the good one though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super size me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gotta be some sort of,
of documentation that's shown because like
[SPEAKER_07]: you can't just let them tell it and you'll
let them tell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're never going to show the guys that
really became martyrs or, or.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, but this is the beauty of
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the opportunity to hear from so
many different people and get so many
[SPEAKER_04]: perspectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like it used to be where one
person is telling the history of the
[SPEAKER_04]: world, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not even one person, but let's say 20
people have history books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have a hundred thousand podcasts of
different experience, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so history is changing in the sense
that we have more history told by more
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're getting more perspective on
reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: The opportunity is there now to have all
these different stories that are told from
[SPEAKER_04]: the mouths of people, not second or third
or fourth hand stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's the beauty of technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of the curse side of
it, but I think that's the beauty side of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the beauty side of history moving
forward is now we have all the opportunity
[SPEAKER_04]: to tell our own story in our own and our
own version of the story.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a beautiful part before
it gets weird and skewed by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it's going to get weird in
anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: History is becoming weird with technology
and all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I never thought in my life
that I wouldn't be able to relate to the
[SPEAKER_04]: younger generations, like the,
you know, the teenagers, because I was,
[SPEAKER_04]: I always felt as I've gotten older that I
could relate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the last couple of years,
it's been interesting because I feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't relate to the younger kids quite
as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand, you know, I think my
parents, same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, they didn't understand the
work ethic of our generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my grandparents didn't understand that
because I come from hardworking people.
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents, my grandparents, everybody,
they're hardworking people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I heard them talking about the work
ethic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I see the younger kids and it's like
their work ethic is much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their focus on stuff is much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try not to judge too much, you know,
I try to just focus on myself,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm also observant of what's going on
in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like, they might be able to
code you a whole scenario for an idea that
[SPEAKER_07]: you have, but they couldn't change it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tired to save the death of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not everybody's like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're kind of putting them all in
a box, but coding is going to be a thing
[SPEAKER_04]: in the past anyway with AI.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to learn how to code.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to use AI to code anything
that you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So which is another scary step in the
future that, you know, it's a little
[SPEAKER_07]: weary, like the thought of removing the
human element from things, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like there's AI music, like I've seen some
sort of inputs and prompts lead to some
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of output, but it's like,
dude, you're taking away the idea of the
[SPEAKER_07]: musician.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some of the most artistic influential
people that will be in your life that we
[SPEAKER_07]: grew up like, Oh, I love the boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like now you will be able to
make better music than human music.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that we all have influence and
for AI to have influence from our
[SPEAKER_04]: influences.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that there's a natural progression
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really strange thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no AI Hendrix, you know,
there's no AI Led Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no AI, you know, but yeah,
but the brain will get smarter,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, but there's easily AI dance
music, AI hip hop beats, AI that from the
[SPEAKER_07]: way that artistic side of the world is
going.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very easy to be like, okay,
now go in there and rap on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then where does cannabis go with AI?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, cause so I can tell
you, I can tell you with breeding where it
[SPEAKER_04]: goes, AI does predictive modeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're going to be able to use
predictive modeling from AI to actually
[SPEAKER_04]: speed up the process of breeding when
we're trying to reach specific goals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more data we have to give it,
the easier it's going to be to tell us a
[SPEAKER_04]: path and give us a successful path for
going in the directions we want to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what it can analyze DNA at such a
rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a fast rate, way faster than we
could.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's like, it can take this
things that we're doing and it accelerated
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like I said, there's probably good
things and bad things with it in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point in my life, I hang with my
dogs that don't turn on the TV and I try
[SPEAKER_07]: not to look at my fucking phone too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you know, I don't need the
anxiety for so many years living and
[SPEAKER_07]: working.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you've been living in the US and in
Europe too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've been on and off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You and your wife live out there a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I met my wife in California and it
was, I had gotten home from the feds in
[SPEAKER_07]: 2010 and then was back on the hill in 2014
after probation was done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, thanks to Red, he brought
me right back on the hill and was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I met my wife that year and then ended up
still staying in California working until
[SPEAKER_07]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of 2018, after that
harvest, I was like, all right,
[SPEAKER_07]: let's just go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm burnt out again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same shit, different year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just like, I need a break.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need like a moment of clarity in my life
where like I can just focus on the things
[SPEAKER_07]: I love and not, you know, lose a toe
trying.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the back, I'm working on
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm working on the cartridge, you know,
still doing some work out here,
[SPEAKER_07]: but popping in, popping out, you know,
and sleeping, standing up on flights and
[SPEAKER_07]: it was a little gnarly the first two
years, the ping pong and cause it you got
[SPEAKER_07]: to still have it and you don't want to
live like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was easy for me to get visas in Europe
because it's like reunification of family
[SPEAKER_07]: and my wife is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't like, it's not very difficult
for me to book a visa.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a visa in Austria.
[SPEAKER_07]: I lived in Austria, the Netherlands,
Berlin, and now I'm outside of Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that all this is coming back and
this is done, all this is getting done and
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be coming back.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and now I'm kind of driving
around and like, do I really want to come
[SPEAKER_03]: back here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause like Spain is so peaceful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so peaceful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so peaceful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Barcelona, especially the outskirts
of Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so mellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's like a slower pace of life,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though Barcelona, even though there
is like the faster paced Barcelona life,
[SPEAKER_04]: the party life, you know, staying out
late, hanging out, eating good food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Food's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but it is a slower pace of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: The machine doesn't move like that out
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're expecting turnover times of
next day, it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to get shit done, it just,
it doesn't move at the same speed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So going there as an American or a
Californian from the Bay area,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then go and expecting people to do
stuff on your schedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to set up a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a long time to set up a business
in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the difference is, is if you have
money, you can move the needle a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: faster, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one advantage of going to places
like Spain, where I feel like you go in
[SPEAKER_04]: there and you just want to do stuff like
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but no, if you want to pay a good
lawyer that knows how to maneuver through
[SPEAKER_04]: the system, it's more, it's way more
expensive, but you can set up a business
[SPEAKER_04]: in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas it might take you six months to a
year or longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're just trying to go through the
regular channels and do stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes, you know, your money is your
shovel, as they say, they dig your tunnel,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, so in certain places,
and it's not like American, like leave a
[SPEAKER_07]: hundred thousand dollars on my back
doorstep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like a little bit of money
goes a long way because if you look at the
[SPEAKER_07]: average income and how people live there
and you compare it to here and the ability
[SPEAKER_07]: to make money, it's a completely different
animal than America.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I'm hearing a lot of talk
about Americans.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the promised land.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the side hustle was invented in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like everybody I know from Spain
has a side hustle of some form.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody does some alternative form of
work to make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so they, they do know how
to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just work at a different pace and a
different speed and they're way more
[SPEAKER_04]: relaxed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also value different things in life
more than we value.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not saying like us personally,
me and you, but it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's the money is your God.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's the money's cool,
but life is cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that whole social life that
everybody has out there that I think is
[SPEAKER_04]: missing from a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's something that we
probably absorbed from our friends that
[SPEAKER_04]: spent time in Europe originally,
and then spending time in Europe
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves, we really kind of fell,
you know, we felt aligned to that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I still am a workaholic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still work my ass off, but I also have
that need for a social life, need for
[SPEAKER_04]: friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still go hang out with friends on the
weekends and we cook and we do fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a life balanced life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wouldn't say I have a balanced
life even close, but I still, I still
[SPEAKER_04]: treasure those experiences with my friends
where we can do stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would say that there is no work
life balance for me, but I still enjoy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have great friends and my friends have,
we have great experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still eat great food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't drink nearly as much as we used
to, so we remember stuff more.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't do as much stupid shit as we used
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's always good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But all that stupid drinking shit,
crazy left, right, up, down, all that's
[SPEAKER_07]: what creates the memories that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was great when we were younger to
do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's like, I think you're
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does create the memories.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some really good times.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's just, you know, it's,
I talked to Pauly about it and a couple
[SPEAKER_07]: other guys about like how just that,
that October, November, I guess,
[SPEAKER_07]: what are the kids saying now?
[SPEAKER_07]: The vibe that was in the air in California
back in the day, it was like just that
[SPEAKER_07]: energy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something that you look forward to
every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, it was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now it's kind of like October,
November's here, but that energy is not
[SPEAKER_07]: the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also not the same as when we were
younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we got gray hair now,
my gray hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't grow a beard out because I talk me
in at 10 PM, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like my sleep now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I used to think it was great to not
get sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, you know, I was tough for being
able to suck it up and get a five hour
[SPEAKER_04]: night of sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then back at it in the morning and
back at it and just work through,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, power through the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and there is some value to
that when the time is right and you need
[SPEAKER_04]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we need to value sleep and
rest and exercise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those things are super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's they're just as important as
making money and success.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it is health is wealth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like there is that level of
success where you can be exercising.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can afford to eat right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all those things, I mean, that that's
success.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just back to this thing for a
second.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we were thinking about doing to
kind of bring this to market, not
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily is just our brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it may collaboration.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were thinking about a lot of
collaborations, genetics guys,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys that specifically focus on genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw your name on the box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Profit share with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Simple, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you've got other extractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're using our SOP, et cetera,
you partner with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You partner with guys that are like minded
individuals that look at this as a value
[SPEAKER_07]: add to their portfolio.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you bring it to market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember meeting I was in I was in
Barcelona and, you know, one guy that I
[SPEAKER_07]: think is like definitely a Bay Area old
timer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like us is Peli and Champ Peli transplant.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peli is like San Francisco now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's originally San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's done Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's the man.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like me and him started talking
and I had never spoken to him before,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it was comfortable talking to a guy
that had lived that same era as that we
[SPEAKER_07]: lived.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'd been out or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, the the nostalgia was
the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I brought it to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once it was done and I was a little
skeptical about what he was going to say,
[SPEAKER_07]: because I know that he's he's got a pretty
high filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he tried it out and was just well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me try it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which you want to try it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go low terpene first or no high
terpene first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low THCA.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll we'll slowly get it
stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to taste the turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see what straight turps
basically are low, low cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: high turps taste like.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the holy water back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we used to get was super,
super high turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been smelling it a little bit,
too, and I'm like, well, it's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So part of the tech that we have,
the brain cools the coil down and forces
[SPEAKER_07]: the user to wait and locks them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not overcooking everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you just hold this button down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not destroying volatile
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: What flavor is the blue dream?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's frozen turps, blue dream,
live resin, or excuse me, blue dream,
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh, frozen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Too hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got to wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as that diamond fills up,
the coils cool down to a temperature
[SPEAKER_07]: where.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what concentration are we smoking
right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like about 50, 50?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you guys, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the flavor is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job on the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really captured the essence of blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at my frozen options from
one of my buddy's farms, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go with trusty dream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like back to that whole turp mixing
thing, there's a scenario in which you
[SPEAKER_07]: might do extractions where you're getting
the candy, you're getting the fruits,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're getting, you're getting the orange,
the lemon, the cherry, the grape.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you want to, you know, you want it to
have a little bit of gas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You blow 10% of OG in there or sour or
glue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you have a gassier version of that
turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, that's the beauty in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cocktail turp sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I like the winemaker model where
you can add a little bit of gas to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a little bit of candy to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like, then you can get real
creative, like the winemaker would for
[SPEAKER_04]: their brand, you know, and it's like,
I see that happening with rosin a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's only going to get
bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cocktail, the blending of this stuff,
uh, but also blending of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_04]: you can totally blend isolates too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like you could, in theory,
throw CBD, CBG, diamonds in there as CB
[SPEAKER_07]: question mark diamonds in there,
whatever you wanted to do from an
[SPEAKER_07]: isolation standpoint and can a terpene.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you see like, what was that one
company?
[SPEAKER_07]: They should do a lot of those formulas,
poppies and Barclays or something like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you can kind of do that same
formulation with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wanted to have a CBD to THC sort
of, because the, the terpene always is
[SPEAKER_07]: roughly around 45 to 50.
[SPEAKER_07]: 50% THC a in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because once you start removing more of
that THC a and getting higher
[SPEAKER_07]: concentration of terpenes, it's a little
too floral.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you do that with the pen?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's say I want to do 10% THC a and a
hundred percent terpenes or 90% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I guess it would be a blend,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking at that ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I wanted to do super low to where it
doesn't get you high, but I wanted that
[SPEAKER_04]: floral crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Covers your mouth with Terps or does it
not?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't hit right.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you add 10%, that's a little low.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you're going to make it to
a, to a ratio of that, even at its lowest,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you're just smoking Terps or you won't
even hit at 10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to override the system to
even get that low.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I don't, there's not like the UI
is the UI.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you can't lower it past the
point of a failure point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a window of, of Watts you're
throwing at each side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the difference in the
intensity.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not changing temperatures.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not, you're only changing power.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you smoke just pure THC out of that
with no Terps?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that like, let's say you didn't want
to smell, you're going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to smell like anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you definitely don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're smoking pure THC, you're a
soldier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause it's going to be rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be really harsh.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna be rough, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, you, you drink your
fucking whiskey warm and in a fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: porta potty, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you're a tough dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign this guy up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfiltered cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the camel ones and no filter
camels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like those guys, those guys were the
renegades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe the, hopefully the
industry will accept it and adapt to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I think it's a great direction
to go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else, it's a great direction
and it's, it's innovative.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the potential is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, so you said something that
kind of resonated with me a little bit was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, so do you want to have 13 pens just
sitting at home?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, yeah, if you look in my,
I have a pen holder for my pens,
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably have 13 or 14 pens in there
with all different flavors and I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them are rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So rosin carts have a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably not smoking them all before
they aren't at their peak level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this would be an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I see it as something that has a
lot of value potentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: My man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as Portugal, let's talk a little
bit about Portugal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of been talking about Portugal
ever since you were first starting to get
[SPEAKER_04]: your license over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is the scene over in Portugal?
[SPEAKER_07]: Portugal is pretty quiet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it, it's just desirable because
of where it's at on the ag map and the
[SPEAKER_07]: cost to operate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cheap there in comparison.
[SPEAKER_07]: To here is good soil, good water,
good summers in the South, long summers in
[SPEAKER_07]: the South.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good surfing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good surfing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can kind of grow 11 weekers there
comfortably in the South.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll finish out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with climate change or whatever
the fuck is happening in this world,
[SPEAKER_07]: like that's starting to maybe change a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some years there, it didn't rain at
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like come November, it's normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like end of November, it should be fairly
rainy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't raining.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this year it rained a little bit
earlier than you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm watching them like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: They allow for the medicinal cultivation
for the EU.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're a big hub too for other
countries importing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Germany does a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at, you know, the numbers,
Germany does a lot of medicinal importing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now with the social club scenario
and the banning barrier to entry in Europe
[SPEAKER_07]: being GMP facilities and all the rules
that go on with flower and stability
[SPEAKER_07]: testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's set up from a pharmaceutical
standpoint as a filtration point to keep a
[SPEAKER_07]: specific financial class out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at it, a lot of it seems
asinine and like, why would you fucking
[SPEAKER_07]: need to do this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, why are they doing this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this hundred lighter is going to
cost you $4 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's make this a little bit more
difficult of a club to get into.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they did it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now seeing Germany go the way it's
going.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we both know where Spain's at,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get sometimes when like people see
what's going on in some of the rec weed
[SPEAKER_07]: states and they're like, well,
every block here smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now everyone's just fucking flooding the
city smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I could see like that in Europe would
probably get pushed back.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Europe government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, it was kind of wide open.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were rolling joints in fucking
restaurants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you do not do that stuff in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's changed so much because I
remember rolling my joint up that I was
[SPEAKER_04]: going to smoke after dinner at the dinner
table at a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think people got kind of
sick of it to a degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the government definitely pushed back
and was like, no, this ain't going to
[SPEAKER_04]: happen here, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially you Americans.
[SPEAKER_07]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Europe has legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Europe is definitely a place where
the industry will eventually expand to
[SPEAKER_07]: from a rec standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily the gray area social club
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody is looking for the new America.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think after living there for so long
and you and I both know it's like they
[SPEAKER_07]: just don't consume cannabis the way
Americans do.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they consume hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's from a concentrated form,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They still want American genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still want a lot of the American
principles.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to weed, they want the West
Coast genetics and the West Coast with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Cali weed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever the Cali weed, the Cali
genetics, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they smoke a lot more hash than
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that connoisseur market for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All around the world, there's this
connoisseur market that wants that West
[SPEAKER_04]: Coast style product.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of Europeans still smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just I think from a volume play,
if you're just looking at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just gross volume in the flower to
consumption levels per person spread
[SPEAKER_07]: across the EU and you compared it to
America, it'd be a scary number because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's guys out there that smoke five,
four grand blunts a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's do I think it's over consumed when
you see the popular aspect being the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid content, the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: As being as what makes all these people
hype.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 34 percent tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get fucking high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most New Yorkers I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want it if it doesn't get them
fucking stone stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why sour diesel was popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why the first time my friend
from New York had glue, he called me and
[SPEAKER_07]: he was like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when I spoke, I was like,
it's too stony.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I can't operate my day under this
fucking strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It ain't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's like, this is the one man where
this is what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was surprised the PIF got so popular
out there because it's not as strong as
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: PIF is cool, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like PIF.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love PIF.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love PIF.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like I like the hazes because
they're rare now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some guys trying to bring them
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen some stuff, but it's like,
you know, everything's been thrown to the
[SPEAKER_07]: wolves.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to get some of the old strains
that that we grew up on and stuff that
[SPEAKER_07]: really moved the needle for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, let's talk about those for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure people are excited to hear about
the old genetics that we used to have
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them didn't even have names.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you go far back enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: The specific genetics, it was all about,
you know, it was green butter,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was, you know, especially if you're
buying stuff, it was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you want this fucking it was top shelf or
brown, but a lot of times it was never
[SPEAKER_04]: called top shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, it was it was we had all kinds of
names.
Crip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Crip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Crippler.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the Crip, the Crippler.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was always funny names for stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, I mean, there was some strange
names, but like it wasn't always
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: First time I saw Crip, my buddy came back
from Florida and he was visiting his
[SPEAKER_07]: sister and she was in college there and he
came back with two ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were taking the nugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We threw it at the wall and it just stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were like, oh, God.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my first introduction into
California, you know, I never,
[SPEAKER_07]: ever ended up with anything from Canada at
that, though, during those years that,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, I even have a memory of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: My graduation to Northern California in
2000 ish, like I have a broad memory of
[SPEAKER_07]: coming here and like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, the honeydew haze,
the Matanuska mist, lavender perps,
[SPEAKER_07]: granddaddy, the real Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really miss that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was bright.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a cute baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like drinking one of these fucking
cucumber drinks in the summertime on a
[SPEAKER_07]: boat was like smoke in the mist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, so I'm just glad it's still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't see it as often.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's no one growing it in
bulk that I know of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that seeds are still available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simon still sells Cali mist seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I know it's still available.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see a lot of people growing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe the appeal isn't maybe people
don't understand the appeal until they try
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe it needs to make its rounds
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the original cat piss.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing better than cat piss in
its day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like whatever you think the best
thing is now, cat piss was that and then
[SPEAKER_04]: some.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just so much different than
everything else that was around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one little small piece would make your
whole car, your clothes, your whole room
[SPEAKER_04]: would smell like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the smoke was distinct cat piss smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be like, fuck, they're smoking cat
piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was really the exotic of its
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was 60 bucks an ace straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't matter how many you bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was top, top, top price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghu was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super silver goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the Afghu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Afghui.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ayoda was all of the above.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ayoda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ayoda had hella red hair, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ayoda that I smoked didn't have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was bright and green and it was pretty
frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as frosty as like the Afghu.
[SPEAKER_07]: I vaguely remember seeing a jar of Ayoda
that was just like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Insane red hair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that was a.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a drunken knight in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those years were like semi a blur,
you know, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was the Hassan that was like,
yeah, there was the Hassan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good one for my boy,
Josh Freeman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pink Cream Jasmine Soda was another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that cut from Josh and that was
like, it was the early finisher of its
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It never got to be big tall plants,
but it finished early.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the Bay Area, you wanted something
early along with all the other stuff you
[SPEAKER_04]: grew because of all the damage that you
would get from caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it never got caterpillars on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of those, it was like resistant
to caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if the turps just kept them off
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it finished so early, the
caterpillars just didn't have time to do
[SPEAKER_04]: any damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_04]: It missed the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Although those are the days when,
you know, hopefully the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_07]: coming up for the future is as remarkable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has the potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still a dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt is filled with passionate people
still that will just grow weed for
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: If nothing else still, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they obviously care about money,
but they care more about the flower and
[SPEAKER_04]: the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there's companies doing it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like there's some good companies
doing it up there that are pushing the
[SPEAKER_04]: limits.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like we got Ridgeline
Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Johnny from Huckleberry Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason and Johnny, those guys are a pair,
but they do some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of their breeding stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnny kind of got on the map for that,
but I feel like that's just the beginning
[SPEAKER_04]: of all the stuff that he can really bring
to the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Ridgeline has the Lance or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridgeline Runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason's doing some good stuff and he's
just a good person.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were on the show.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's like they're devoted to
the plant too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about devotion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys are devoted to the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Dave from Budge Laro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's up in Mendocino up in Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the sour diesel guy now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found the new sour diesel guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the sour diesel guy, but he's also
the long flowering variety guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he does those long flowering ones that
just have amazing effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He breeds specifically for effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're growing specifically for effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so many other guys that I'm
not even naming right now, but there's
[SPEAKER_04]: guys that are still just so passionate and
still trying to move the needle,
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to bring back genetics,
trying to create new genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and we need all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry needs all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need all that passion infused into the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I think the future is bright
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people look down on the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're worried about the future,
but I think in a lot of ways the future is
[SPEAKER_04]: still bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still plenty to be innovated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a lot of innovation
still that can be had in this industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's lights, whether it's extract,
whether it's, you know, genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many things that still need to
be explored.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just excited for the future,
you know, constantly being excited,
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly being amazed by the stuff
people around me are doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and I'm just, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm along for the ride in some ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like with the breeding book,
it was like this big challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I finished it, it's like,
okay, what's next for me?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we going to do next with the
book?
[SPEAKER_04]: So every couple of years, every,
you know, probably every few years,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to do a new release on the
breeding book and update the information
[SPEAKER_04]: and the beauty of technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can put the supplemental stuff in there
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we create this stuff online,
we can infuse it into a new book.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just kind of keeping a timestamp and
moving it forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And constantly trying to move the needle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The needle forward with everything that we
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, this facility, we're trying to
do the best we can do and make a
[SPEAKER_04]: difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm out there working in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines with some farmers and
[SPEAKER_04]: with the government, the MCA out there,
the medical cannabis authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm excited about the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited about other people's podcasts
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of good podcasts out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, or how about, we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: switch this up today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had one piece of advice for our
group of friends and their younger selves,
[SPEAKER_04]: what would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest fault I've seen from a lot of
successful guys from our era, they never
[SPEAKER_07]: save their money because they felt that
this would never go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's painful.
[SPEAKER_07]: The war stories when you get the phone
calls and stuff, like it sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, their hearts in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you saw in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things from 14 to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was back on that hill from that
harvest to now.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you calculate the cost drop,
like you're saying, like that's
[SPEAKER_07]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost not sustainable for a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a frugal farmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been saving your money.
[SPEAKER_07]: You understood that there was a
possibility of this happening because of
[SPEAKER_07]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's walking a path that has been walked
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can pivot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: People build families and people have
children.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's real human beings behind this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the stories are painful to hear because
they've been doing this for so long and we
[SPEAKER_07]: respect them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now it's kind of like,
I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my thing is like, not going to change
the devotion that people have because
[SPEAKER_07]: that's always been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you could change essentially the
financial structure of how they spent and
[SPEAKER_07]: what they save for, because if you knew,
if a little bird flew down and told you,
[SPEAKER_07]: hey, 2024, this is going to be the ticket
for a unit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd approach it a little bit
differently, but sometimes people just
[SPEAKER_07]: have blind faith in things and I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a trait.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would be it because I still think
the industry is in decent hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think the industry is in decent
hands, but it's like it would be in more
[SPEAKER_06]: decent hands if the finances were
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my take on it because I don't
think that there was a whole lot of buck
[SPEAKER_07]: ups in where we're at in flower now,
where we're at in tech now and where we're
[SPEAKER_07]: at in pushing the plant through.
[SPEAKER_04]: The buck ups pushed the plant forward,
if anything, and pushed us forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I think we all fucked up to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all had our fuck ups and it's like a
lot of them were good learning experiences
[SPEAKER_04]: for all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't lose too many friends from
violence, luckily.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we may have lost some friends
getting locked up and we may have caught
[SPEAKER_04]: cases and stuff like that, but a lot of
those were good learning experiences on
[SPEAKER_04]: what not to fucking do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think we're pretty blessed to
have the friends that we have and to have
[SPEAKER_04]: the experiences that we were blessed to
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's made us who we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't take any of those experiences
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good ones, the bad ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, unfortunately, I think they're all
good learning experiences, if nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some wild, wild stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stories that I can't even talk about on
camera, but it's like they've made me who
[SPEAKER_04]: I am today and made me appreciate what we
have, which is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we kept doing it before.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got locked up and then we came back and
just did it legally when we got out,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it was the medical, the two 15
days up until now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like when we were back in this and
it was like, okay, well we can be above
[SPEAKER_07]: ground now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't really got to worry too much
about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had friends that got kicked out of the
country for cases, serving sentences,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then getting kicked out of the country
and never allowed back in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my cell got deported back to Haiti
after I think 18 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of our mutual friends got
deported to Italy when she was born in
[SPEAKER_04]: Italy, had never really lived in Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: His parents had passed and everything else
and wandered Europe and figured it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, over a case, a nonviolent drug
offense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, this world is kind of
crazy, but I think we're also starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: recognize to a degree that cannabis
especially isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis isn't the enemy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people are looking to find more
about Mikhail, where would they go?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got everything coming online now.
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be the website, which is www
.terpsturpz.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Instagram is rareterps at rareterps
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think we have a Twitter set up
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just like really at the point of
like, we've got all these storyboards from
[SPEAKER_07]: an animator that I work with and it kind
of explains all the aspects of the cart.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a tutorial for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you, when you purchase it,
you'll scan a QR code and that will lead
[SPEAKER_07]: you to how to use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything's kind of getting finalized
and brought to life now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking meetings, just figuring out
distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making sure that, you know, the stakes are
high these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it costs a lot of money to come bring
your, your little toy into the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you gotta, you gotta,
you gotta do this more calculated and less
[SPEAKER_07]: cavalier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything's getting buttoned up to a
point that we're going to push forward
[SPEAKER_07]: correctly and make sure that there's no
like loose ends or, or open knots when we
[SPEAKER_07]: do come to market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think, could I push to come to
market with in like the next 90 to 120
[SPEAKER_07]: days?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could still happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause obviously there's a lot of frozen
coming down now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a lot of frozen in
freezers.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think our big, hello, how are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, is going to be at the end of next year
when we're pulling down our acreage and
[SPEAKER_07]: really got things in line.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to definitely take some of
your genetics and put that out in that
[SPEAKER_07]: field and get the James jungle juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a, you know, I'd love to
collaborate on some level and that sounds
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring more of this Mexican moonshine when
you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty good, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_07]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we're chasing flavors,
that's one of those flavors I chase.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like so smooth thing is it's a hunter
proof, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like the hunter proof and smooth
and people don't understand what that
[SPEAKER_04]: means.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means you start drinking it with your
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're sitting around a table drinking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next thing you know, the bottle is gone
with four people and you don't feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: you're, you've had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking to your friends, but then you
stand up and you're like, I gotta sit back
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a hundred proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hundred proof and it's super
smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't taste like a hundred proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how smooth it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was special, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, next time, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to seeing you over in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you'll be at spandibus.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be, uh, hopefully at Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Berlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm not here, I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I'm not there, then I'll be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we might have to come back
to get this thing into traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for sure.

[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
