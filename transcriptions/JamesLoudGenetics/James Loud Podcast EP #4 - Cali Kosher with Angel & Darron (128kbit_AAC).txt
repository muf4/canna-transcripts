[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the James Loud podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Angel and Darren from Cali Kosher.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excited to be here after 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your 420?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, we smoked so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had to take a little power nap,
a little five minute to recuperate and
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure we could finish the day strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Busted out the donuts and I hate when they
busted out the donuts because once the
[SPEAKER_02]: donuts come out, it's kind of over with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of over with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even ate some mushrooms yesterday and
then went to lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your special 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got to stay away from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do the microdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the microdose in Oakland,
legal, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, these were some gushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were gushers gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so mushroom gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mushroom gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're evolving now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole industry is evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming up quick too, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it was what, cap and stem and drink
your orange juice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like chewing cardboard sunflower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we have a little history
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working together, I guess,
for the last four years with some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys ran some of my gear a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, what'd you think of the genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: We loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ran it at one of our Calaveras farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: With Sugar Bear Farms and had good results
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked well, extract well, rolled up well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially now with things evolving,
you're talking about THC getting higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think around that time we were low 20s,
somewhere in there in the THC range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did well for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you guys are vertically
integrated as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work in the lab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I handle all the extracts, solving
this, solving, and everything in between
[SPEAKER_03]: the topicals and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so yeah, vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got our nursery growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do our own distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got our own manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got any product that comes from
us, it actually comes from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't go buy it from somebody else,
roll it up, just put it in our bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually grown by us, processed by
us, and distributed by us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So completely vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Kali Kosher is Kosher
certified cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and you've been doing this a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me a little bit of history about
yourself and how you got into the rec
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you doing before rec?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess let's go way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started selling cannabis when I was in
seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to 15 different schools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after going to all these different
schools, my network was pretty broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going from country to town,
a friend actually introduced me to some
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name was Stephen Parks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he fronted me my first pound of good
old brickweed, good old brick redbud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely seated, picking those bad boys
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that time, I didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just bagging up little tin sacks,
selling them in the apartments that I
[SPEAKER_02]: lived in, and was using the money just to
buy school clothes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, at that age, I'm not trying to
buy fancy clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to buy a fancy car or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how I got into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I was 17, I started growing
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, started having the pads
like everybody did, and so on and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here we are, coming to the
medical side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make a long story short, did the
Oakster Dam University thing down there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of followed that model and doing
the non-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do the three month course,
or the longer course, or you do the
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the short course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole compacted course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it real quick, I think, in like three
months or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe less than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then got my greenhouses up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purchased a dispensary right there in
Modesto that was only a medical dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up getting a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting my greenhouse license was on the
forefront right there in Stanislaus
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting everything improved and doing
the walk throughs.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the state and with the local
municipalities and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pushed to get vertically integrated so
that we could be more of what we were on
[SPEAKER_02]: the black market side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to do everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my goal was to keep on doing what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to get every license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very fortunate in doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're one of the very few that
have every license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have no Canadian groups or
any outside investors or anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a group of friends and myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we own our land.
[SPEAKER_02]: We own our license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we're still here today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially when times have gotten
tough and prices have dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so much more competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even think the quality of this stuff in
rec has gotten so much better over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw some of these guys coming into
the rec market from the black market or
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as they jumped into rec,
they started scaling really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the product went to shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had consistent product over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What percentage of your product stays in
the company through your dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what percentage goes out
typically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Through our dispensaries, it's probably
about 10%, 15% through our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the product goes out to the
other dispensaries throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the reason why you see the
quality taper off in the beginning is
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone was trying to figure out
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to figure out how do we
navigate through just getting the license
[SPEAKER_02]: or getting approved through your local
county or city or whatever it is you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was trying to navigate through
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they forgot that, hey, we still got to
grow the product and do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of what I saw is the first ones to
get the licenses weren't the legacy guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the big companies with a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so of course, they're not going to
have as good a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are definitely catching
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, I think Seattle, in
Washington, I feel like their market's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more stabilized, although they've
had a recession lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, what we're going to do on the
show is we're doing a blind tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have three different products that I
pulled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Ace from Cookies and Hayward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're going to do is a blind
tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one of them that's a $5 a gram or
less, one that's $10 a gram or less,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one that's $15 or more before taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just a fun way for us to get
involved with the industry and showcase
[SPEAKER_01]: different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the more expensive ones
aren't as good as the cheaper ones and
[SPEAKER_01]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're going to start with this
first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to dry hit it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rolled nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for damn sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a good dry hit to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a professional joint roller
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a professional joint roller to
Instagram on our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he does for a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does all these tips and he has some
pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the specialty on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one that he rolled, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my guy, Joe, that works with
me, who I've known since he was 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy, his been rolling joints for
30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been rolling about the same,
but he crushes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have him roll the joints every
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I do if he's not around,
but he does a really good job with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's the simple crutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do the reverse roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this guy, the professional joint
roller, this guy fucking does a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: joints a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all like eighth size joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one looks pretty proper to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All hand rolled too, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: All hand rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I ever do a pre-roll, it's going to be
hand rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing the machine stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packing the dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, using a blender.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Subject number eight right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me a little bit about what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in the manufacturing side of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically they grow fire flower at the
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hunt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get it down, down, send it over to
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there we'll decide whether
we want to process it into solventless or
[SPEAKER_03]: BHO, depending on yield quality and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there we could go another
step further and we'll either make it into
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin, rosin jam, solventless carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a wide variety of consistencies
under each one, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So solventless carts over the last year
have gotten really popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: People love rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're big right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're real big right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like the half gram cart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really like the gram ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like the gram carts either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I feel like by the time you get down
to the end of them, they don't taste very
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what everybody says.
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste burnt by the time you get to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'd rather just a quick bang.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking solventless here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are got that burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, there was those two gram
carts going around for a while and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, they're thinking more bang for the
buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could charge a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like two gram carts.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So live resin, two gram carts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concept was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whatever they were thinking,
they could save some money and put two
[SPEAKER_01]: grams, but it just, it starts tasting bad
halfway through.
[SPEAKER_01]: On two grams, you got about a gram of good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it seems like with the rosin
carts, the solventless carts, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: the half gram is the perfect amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, even if you do throw away a
little bit at the end or you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit it anymore, you're not losing that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the ash on that thing though.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the ash looks really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty white, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the whitest of white,
but it's pretty white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tasted okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not as good as a turp transfer as I
would have liked from the dry hit to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the, to the lit hit, but it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try another hit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, the second hits better than
the first.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I tell him too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, let me hit things the second
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause sometimes I feel like the first time
when I light it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's got to make it to round two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about like some of the old
school strains, like cat piss back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, you could fire or sour diesel or OG
Kush, like really good Kush, really good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not with everything, but like the special
stuff you could fire it up a week later
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would still taste like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see that as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying some stuff out yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had some friends over trying
out different stuff that people brought
[SPEAKER_02]: over kind of like we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back in there in the morning and I
always tell Tony like, Hey, let me grab a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of those roaches before you throw
them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, man, no, I'm gonna roll a fresh
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check the relight of a couple of
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to know if it,
if it still carries turps on a relight,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's, that's saying something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some real weed, you know,
that's real connoisseur stuff though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're really, it's rare genetics
wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a lot of good stuff that
smokes well, but it doesn't refire well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that really attracted
me to weed when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got me real excited about stuff where you
could smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I smoked roaches when I was a kid,
we didn't have all the money in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: and nostalgia for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roaches are nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just takes me back to Raiden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys ever roll the generation joints
where you have your jar of fucking roaches
[SPEAKER_01]: and you break all the weed out and roll a
fucking blunt or roll a big joint blown
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the, I got this one real quick
finger smelling on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone packs the blunt roach and the
bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that ever happened to you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we used to smoke reclaimed too,
but that's happened to me on accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it was, but boy, put the whole
roach in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's a pretty white ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it less than $5 a gram, less than 10 or
more than 15?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get to pick at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to go by each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you can change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can change it at the end, but we're
just going to go, just as of right now to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of set the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say that that one is going to
be in the, we're going to roll in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be the $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: $10 or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying $10 less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't feel like it was bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like there might be some other,
a little bit lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice guy or some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy was a wild one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest hash smuggler at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smuggled hash in the band equipment all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school outlaw, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school outlaws.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, I'm 46 right now and
the generations before us, it was a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's gotten so- Still a bit more
loose around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more loose, a little bit more
accepted by everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be in the shadows before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we got, you're coming out in the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out in the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're telling our stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it was like a secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some crazy stories over a
joint or over some beer back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey man, so and so smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that dude's got eight lights,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better keep it on the fucking low,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go be telling that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, don't be telling anybody I got eight
lights, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like- You know,
you had your select group of trimmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was all, yeah, shush man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I first started growing in
the nineties, we basically trimmed at each
[SPEAKER_01]: other's houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really have trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't even pay each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I harvested, everyone would come over
and we'd trim the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We trimmed it wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trimming it wet, wet out the gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the first stuff you were
growing into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a strain called blueberry and it
was a sativa before DJ Short's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew like spears.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have a funny story because
one that I was high as fuck and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize they would double in
flower and they totally doubled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were against the lights and I fell
into the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I took out like three or four
plants completely trying to move the coal
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the lights, slapped me in the
face and my fucking face pulled up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we were growing like,
oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was stuff from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like the four way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Trinity, the four way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snow, the snow bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was snow bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was snow cap, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was snow bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this strain called the snow and
there was a strain called the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were coming down from Eugene
along with like a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had dog coming from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was this strain called
diamond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just super frosted,
but it was like the Oreos of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a lot of our stuff from
genetics, really high end stuff from
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to grow in tables and then I went
to octagons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this vertical grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd you guys start out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I was good old Jorge Cervantes video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, back in the day,
tried to see a green method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just went soil and was feeding some good
old three part GH.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first in a trailer out on
Simmons Road in Turlock, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a buddy's house on a little ranch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first go at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the little moving light rail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a light rail, had it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: One gallon plants, grew them just a little
foot tall, flipped them and just had
[SPEAKER_02]: little shrubs at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, went into a shed,
put it on a tray, did some flood and drain
[SPEAKER_02]: with some growed end cubes or some
coltola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean cubes back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, and then from there just started
evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my strains were my very first ones
with granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our stuff that we got from back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it from Stoney.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then got a hold of some Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then was heading down to Oakland and
was going over there to the Bulldog and to
[SPEAKER_02]: the other dispensaries over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And buying some Triple S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some Morningstar and some Matanuska
and some Romulan and just different stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shaman, the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then come to find out, all I needed to
grow was fucking granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Granddaddy was hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People loved granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best thing in the octagons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm an indoor guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was for a long time and been
trying to get back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been doing greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys crushed it on the greenhouse
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like an indoor product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get back into that indoor and go
back to the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing greenhouse and pulling tarp and
doing it like the way we're doing is old
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's respectable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's respectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's harder to get a better
product than it is indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because indoor you can control the
variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make my seeds indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back real quick to the first grow
that I ever had, which is a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a Phototron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember Phototron
from High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a bag seed from something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in one of the buds and we grew it
out and I used to fucking cut the top off
[SPEAKER_01]: and I stole a light from the Sun Valley
Mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little 400 watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut the top off the Phototron,
put that on the top and had the plant grow
[SPEAKER_01]: up through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was okay weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like super connoisseur bud back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to like outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a time where outdoor was
more expensive than indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was $4,000 pounds,
$4,500 pounds of outdoor back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more prized I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was sticky ass weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really sticky stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people didn't know what they were
doing indoor either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, Phototron got the top off,
did this, that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor you take care of it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry it right is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the big thing these days is having
the dry facility for two acres or three
[SPEAKER_02]: acres of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to dry and cure it
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can grow some fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like one of the biggest aspects and
it gets overlooked so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, what do you guys think of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the ash is not super white,
but it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want another hit of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take another hit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get some turps on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those strains that if you grow
it like shit, it would probably still be
[SPEAKER_01]: turpy, but that's grown, that's grown
decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you for me, I'll take it again,
but I would have spiked it already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping this last one is the winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would rank this one under the
first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the first one had a little bit
more turps to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one has a specific type of turp,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that tangy kind of turp to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I dry hit it, I can get that little
turp on there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Faint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Faint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like one of those ones that if you
grow them in Morocco or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it would probably still have that
turp come through, even if it was like the
[SPEAKER_01]: ugliest looking, grown like shit plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get too much tangy off that one
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got more, it's more bland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't really decipher what the turps
were in the beginning of it, but nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some sativa in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less than five on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have less than 10, less than five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going for gusto right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going for gusto.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is either better or worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would, you know, the thing is,
is like, you can reassign the different
[SPEAKER_01]: ones at the end because- We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the one that we thought under 10 was
going to be the winner, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had people on the episode and we found
one that was like the $85 eighth,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it wasn't as good as the $5 one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just never really know what you're
going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life is like a box of chocolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, we didn't get to dry hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already messed that part up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just messing with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some water on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a little water on the pallet there,
Angel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dust it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still taste that other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that- You still taste that second
one or the first one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I still taste the second one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not a good taste.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they didn't flush it or if they
flushed it, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what kind of nutrients do you guys use?
[SPEAKER_02]: We use Mission Organic Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use that with a little blend of some
Vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to love Vital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little blend of both of those right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run Vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vital Soil at the house was the Vital
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give me the Vital Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian does them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we tried there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our beds is Vital Soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a couple different beds that we
tried out from Mission as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: after seven years, it's our own soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: After keeping the same soil, keeping it
alive, keeping it tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is a lot tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a lot tighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to talk to Joe about
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you roll this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I do roll tight joints like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially now, I wouldn't be taking
credit for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ears are popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: How has this weather affected you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had our wettest year on record,
hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never experienced anything like this
in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said it hasn't caught this
much water in 30 years or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, some crazy number like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of all that, we usually grow
during the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually got our heaters running and our
supplemental lighting is very minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% humidity this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just string lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, there was no point to even
attempt to battle with the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother Nature won for our type of
greenhouse, for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this winter kind of shut us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your growers are fresh and ready to
kick ass, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're hot on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Season is season now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they had the downtime and now here
we are in a full season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you guys think of this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think this is better or worse?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and say mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one we smoked, number one,
this one too, another one, three.
Angel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you guys get more high after you
took hits off of the second joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect was kind of there with the
first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really feel a change with the
second one too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say the first one is number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one's the most expensive?
[SPEAKER_02]: The $15 or more?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the best sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you if it's the most
expensive, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, how you wanted to judge it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The most expensive-est or the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: This one makes me think like old and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go right down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one is number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two was number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three was number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being most expensive, our $10 and our
$5 right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five, 10, 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel's going 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, five, 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five, 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, five, 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else want to try this again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me teach this one again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Ashburn's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take one more hit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys got some joints we got to
smoke too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do the reveal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one we have Sherb Cake by Sea
Junkie Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherb Cake was actually the middle one.
[SPEAKER_01]: $10 or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were right the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were right the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys were absolutely right the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one threw us in the loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is out the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: $5 or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all got that one right, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Disco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to House of Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think it was like a super
fresh product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fountainhead, that's my partners,
Jason and Gordon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a company together up in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the genetics are from Washington
originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genetic, I think it smokes awesome
usually, but it just seems like it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little old.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got them all wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, you know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think that means?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a business owner that's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so this one was the most expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the most expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was the middle and then out the
trunk was actually the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But which one do you think was the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree that this Sherb Cake had the most
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This out the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the Disco was the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I said, I said one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both picked the same one as the best
smoking was this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I both picked this one as the
best, as the most expensive, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I picked this one as the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the most expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I picked the cheapest one, the
cheapest, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that one right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got my one and two wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my lower end one right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like a Ferrari drives like a Pinto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativa always gets the rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your thought on Sativas?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys like Sativas?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the market doesn't really like
them that much, but I think Sativas are
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, equatorial genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask for them a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, it's, it's in demand a lot
by, you know, a lot of older people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do a boutique at a boutique
level where it's, yeah, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a market for it,
but it's tough at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because just a couple of weeks
ago, we've seen two people bring us some,
[SPEAKER_03]: some Jack indoor, you know, and we're
like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still in its age growing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to put it in my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't smoke a lot of it,
but I have European friends that come into
[SPEAKER_01]: town or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, and I like, you know,
Jack, Jack's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the old Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys remember the old
Jack from back in the day that was like
[SPEAKER_01]: super funky and super pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, there's, there are
several Jacks obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Flash was one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favors that we had back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's candy Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, you know, J 13, J 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: We remember the J's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a time where people
were confusing train wreck with Jack
[SPEAKER_01]: Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would buy train wreck and it would
be fucking Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, dude, this is fucking
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, I think that's when the
fuckery kind of started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was the first fucker he ever
noted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain fishing or whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, man, nothing's more
heartbreaking than getting a catfish by
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get genetics, they give you the
wrong fucking catfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, man, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll look at something that'll look
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you smoke it and it's just like,
man, no, no flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of harsh on the throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, man, I got a catfish by this
weed, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My partner, Justin, all the genetics we do
sequencing, everything's fingerprinted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been through my flora DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, we have the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think moving forward, it's going to
be a lot harder to bullshit people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to want to see the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the future's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be able to identify
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, that's not what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to break your heart, but you've been
cut fished.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been cut fished.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a whole show on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Spin off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want credit, all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw me the credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring your strains in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring your strains in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to talk to B-Real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, the lie detector says, detector test
results show.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hire Morrie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Morrie reads it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be more fun with Cheech.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you guys think the industry is
going to do in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see our industry going in the
next five years, 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone through this consolidation in
California quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people didn't renew their
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people didn't renew their
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: 75%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think indoor is indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow indoor anywhere in the
country, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could build the same grow room here in
California as I can in New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could create the same environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the outdoor and the greenhouse,
not everybody can grow that across the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see people, they tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do it in Florida like you can do
it in Oregon or in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least most of the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if and when the lines open up,
I think that's where it's going to benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmers here in California because
people are going to want weed from
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt, weed from California,
just like our wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're going to get your indoor
boutique farmers that are going to be like
[SPEAKER_02]: your micro breweries per se, that you have
those special drops that happen at a
[SPEAKER_02]: little store here in Hayward or Modesto or
wherever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only certain stores that have
these drops of this micro brewery that
[SPEAKER_02]: this certain person bred that he only
makes or they only make, and there's only
[SPEAKER_02]: so much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's where we're going with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have the big guys are
going to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have your Marlboro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have those guys that,
I mean, there's a couple of guys that are
[SPEAKER_02]: already quote unquote at that status.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think it's going to kind of go
the direction of alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And have your Budweiser, your Coors
Lights, and then you're going to have your
[SPEAKER_02]: Sierra Nevadas, but then you're going to
have those even more boutique guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Russian rivers as opposed to Sierra
Nevadas and like the Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Laganitas is a great company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think modeling it after somewhere
between that and the wine industry would
[SPEAKER_01]: be amazing, especially with things like
AVA's, the viticultural areas where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're designated areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that region, you can talk about
Terroir and then you can talk about how
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil affects the taste of your
greenhouse or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could have strain specific stuff
where you can go buy OG Kush that's grown
[SPEAKER_01]: in where you guys are, or you can go to
Humble or Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe OG Kush is grown in all three
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it grows better in Santa Cruz or
something, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were smoking or smelling the weed
earlier that said it smells like the
[SPEAKER_01]: eucalyptus driving into Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the collab with Mosca Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry Boogie times Zerios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got all the fun stuff as far as
turps and looks, then it has this nice
[SPEAKER_01]: eucalyptus smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely unique in a good way,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, Terroir light spectrum,
where it's being grown at, so on and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, 75% of licenses haven't
been renewed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, that helps out the
farmers that are still... It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still growing today, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you've seen distillate
take an increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people were getting liters for
600 bucks and overnight it went to $1,600.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's a huge hike.
