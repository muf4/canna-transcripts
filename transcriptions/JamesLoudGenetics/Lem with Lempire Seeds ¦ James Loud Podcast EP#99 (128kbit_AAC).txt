Music
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guest is Lem from
Lempire Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hanging out at shows on and off
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to shop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up north, you bought some of our books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the kind words with the
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, the book is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to start off just blessing the
energy of the cannabis plant that we all
[SPEAKER_02]: get to share in and giving thanks to the
elders that have basically paved the road
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all walking on and we're carrying
the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you know, we can keep the
next generation well lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's amazing because I think a
lot of people think of breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: something modern with cannabis,
but breeding has been going on since the
[SPEAKER_00]: dawn of time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not since the dawn of time,
but since agriculture has been a thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: since man started breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking two ice ages,
millions and millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they may just be starting to show our
work, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been happening naturally forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, you know, they were
breeding for resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeding for plant fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were breeding for so many different
things for millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're breeding for different
things, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the breeding work has been done for
years to get us to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of work that went on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like humans, you know,
just like humans from the beginning of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nature takes its own course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they're really showing the work
this tonight, like now, like down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual locus on the allele, like really
being able to break it down, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: with that human genome project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting because if you take
something like wild mustard 2500 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, basically cabbage, Brussels sprouts,
kale, all those things, kale, broccoli,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all wild mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of human interaction with the
plant, with wild mustard, we now have all
[SPEAKER_00]: these amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were bred specifically for
different things like land race genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: how apples and wine and cannabis
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing as far as the path
that these things have gone on with human
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction to get us to this point and
how we've grown alongside them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as if, you know, we want to survive
and the plant wants to survive as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those things like the Ethiopian
land raises with the abscisic acid or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wondering like, is this thing
responding to the human?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like humans are starving in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the plant learning how to like live in
drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a response to what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an interaction like an
electromagnetic currency that connect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just surviving, learning how to
deal with drought because otherwise it
[SPEAKER_02]: won't survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost as if the plant has just as
much of a need to survive as we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's adaptation that occurs with
cannabis and with humans that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see with a lot of other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're both making each other better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the, like your book saying,
you know, we're 40% similar genetically,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could have evolved from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushrooms, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always thought that cannabis is in
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for me in my life, people are
always like, yeah, we're in control of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, man, the cannabis chooses
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it's in control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tells you what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, we're just
stewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just moving the plant along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one component of this plant's long
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a magical cosmic connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was telling you, I was up late and
I was thinking about reading your book
[SPEAKER_02]: here, the cannabis breeding book,
and I just cracked it open on the first
[SPEAKER_02]: page and it opened to the Methuselah seed,
the 2000 year old, like the oldest plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the oldest seed they got to germinate in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I was born.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called my buddy up, Dan, and he's like,
oh yeah, my cousin was on that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I visited that plant recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, man, this is such a small world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is exactly what I was thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about old seeds and it just
opened to that page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cosmic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beyond cosmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, serendipity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it occurs so often, not within just
this industry, but within life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as you move through life,
it's like there's an intention and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some things that are just meant to
be, you know, cosmic forces that line up
[SPEAKER_00]: and exactly things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me how you got started with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had seen it growing up and one day I was
walking to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little kid and I had, I found a
little gold case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody must have thrown it out the
window and they got pulled over or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it into school, not knowing what
it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may be second or third grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made me write a report on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like my first exposure to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't used it yet, but then I'm like 10
years old at summer camp and some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: kids from Florida brought joints and we
started getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't like till I was 12,
13, I was having grand mal seizures and
[SPEAKER_02]: there were three days, horrible seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized I could score some weed,
dime bag in the hood, smoke a joint and
[SPEAKER_02]: just not have seizures, you know,
really cut down, have maybe a half a
[SPEAKER_02]: second or 10 second seizure compared to
like a three day seizure or like a two and
[SPEAKER_02]: a half minute grand mal or something that
was damaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really wasn't a question of legality
or morality for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, I had found the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point on, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was writing letters to Carl from the
Super Sativa Seed Lover Club and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds sent in the mail, growing the M19.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had like a, an amazing triple cross of
Pakistani Citron Hash Plant, Afghani Hash
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant and Durban Hash Plant that I had
written a letter and he had sent me skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one and then he sent me skunk one again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself as a 12 year old kid,
I'm like, Hey man, I already have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need something, you know, more za just,
and they're like, listen, we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing a lot of this, but I'm going to
send it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing is I'm back in Spanavis
in 2019 and I run into Carl and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, you're on the original mailing list
and we want to see what you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, I F 150,
like we're deep into crossing that strain
[SPEAKER_02]: five, six times a year into itself over 30
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the backbone to our genetics,
the limb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love seeing those old hazes come to
life, you know, and what you can do just
[SPEAKER_02]: cross them and cross them and cross them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I went to an event that we were
both at, which was the Terp Nami in
[SPEAKER_00]: December, David Downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: David really good event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it was well attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the biggest, but it was well
attended by the people that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great for a first year turnout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought lots of potential, great vibes,
the talent, the talent there, the talent
[SPEAKER_00]: was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is we had guys coming
out of the Hills with sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like true sativa structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about morphology,
that, that leaning with amazing profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: that weren't just the standard gelatos
that everybody's consuming these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about, I mean, we had all
the farms, you got me and Gene are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got everybody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had super silver there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only thing missing was maybe like a
business forum to just kind of help
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like each one of us maybe has an edge or a
tip that we could share with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Von Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite musicians from midnight
says, when together, we realize our actual
[SPEAKER_02]: strength and size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil will be trembling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing that people are
missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't, people overlook what we
have here and what we've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the potential of what will happen if
we just come together and not like worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about the ego or yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be challenging because times
can get rough and all of a sudden you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Whoa, what happened?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis man, you know,
I have to think a little harder to keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: going, but that keeps you on the cutting
edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the challenges,
especially people are facing in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California right now, as the number goes
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're fighting people like glass
house, trying to bring the number down to
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred or 200 bucks when raising the
tax is in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing you can do is tell people,
no, you know, tell that person,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, I'm not going to sell you a box for 20
grand, you know, kick rocks, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just force yourself to get a plan,
enter the white markets, set your brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: build your brand, lock in contracts that
come back forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of waiting for somebody to come
down the driveway who may or may not ever
[SPEAKER_02]: come back, but that's not a building block
to your empire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, on top of just having a pie
chart, like what I tell growers all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time is know where your cannabis is going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what percent is going to go for whole
plant, fresh, frozen, or edibles,
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe that your smalls are going to go
towards joints or pre-rolls or an edible
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know what you're doing before you get
after it, contract your stuff and have it
[SPEAKER_02]: sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that'll help you get ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of trying to grow a thousand or
2000 pounds or get into the point where
[SPEAKER_02]: you've grown more than you thought you
were gonna, which is everybody's goal,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then processing it, you know,
like if you're trying to sell your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in eighths, no, there's 128,
eights in a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to grow a thousand or
2000 pounds, you're probably not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to sell it all in eighths in a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make an edible product, which has been,
you know, concentrate at least converted
[SPEAKER_00]: in and concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't go bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, I see that happening a lot
where people are like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got last year's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, dude, like we're a year and
a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not cryogen or freezing that and
who's got room to do that with a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds, but you can take it and turn it
into a rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn it into any form of hash and
you can preserve it for an extended amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even sieve or dry sieve right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's static.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are getting really into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love static.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love static.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all those forms of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they all have so much
potential, but also the shelf life lasts a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them get better with age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all the hash we were smoking,
let's say 20, 30 years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd score some hash and not
realizing, cause we didn't know about CBNs
[SPEAKER_02]: as much, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This hash is probably two, three years
old.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been smuggled from like Afghanistan
or like Morocco or even longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were getting just ruined on that
stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of this fresh rosin and like when
I smoke it, I'm not a big rosin smoker,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just wakes me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's so fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole plant, fresh frozen glands are
just, they almost have a chi to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have like a high, like a wiry
energy when I smoke them and people can
[SPEAKER_02]: continuously smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could never smoke like a half ounce of
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just put you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like cash oil or brownies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half ounce of hash is equivalent to X
amount of, depending on the strength,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's, that's a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to remember too,
like, you know, Bob Marley, like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: people that were smoking, they were
smoking cannabis, those five or 10% and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you remember being a kid in high
school scoring dime bags and smoking weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and just laughing your ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you were to put that weed to
the lab, it probably wouldn't hit 15,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20%, but it was great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that people miss is
that the Terps decide, they help your
[SPEAKER_02]: brain accept and decide how much THC
you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just dangerous chasing the
percentards or, you know, in the white
[SPEAKER_02]: market, especially it's so prevalent that
you see people, we see two, 300 people a
[SPEAKER_02]: day and most of them just ask us how they
can get the most for their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their value in their mind is like over
30% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what they've been taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in and they're like,
how much THC can I get for 40 bucks?
[SPEAKER_02]: As if like the higher the number is more
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But would you go by 151 and drink that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it, that's a great comparison
and the education is lacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you teach people, they,
they know, but it's, there's a gap,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not everybody's in the bubble or
a chronic sore or like a lifetime cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the older folks, they're not
going to want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming in and you don't want to
start smoking when they're 60 or 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably just want to, most of them
just want to get to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're seeing edibles in my
mind being so prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love edibles, you know, and I love
the direction edibles have gone in with
[SPEAKER_00]: the raws and gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love raws and gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these companies that are actually
just using the flavor from the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to, you know, the raws and gummies.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as the integrity is kept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like that's a problem,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they start using distillate and a lot
of these companies, once they just start
[SPEAKER_02]: having to meet a financial model,
they end up using distillate and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: their brand, but it's not the same
integrity anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a shame as you see like these
giant farms take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrity farms, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Integrity farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think integrity is just so important
in the industry and you're only as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: you last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's batched to a degree, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Michael Omaha, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great elder who always told us,
man, the three most important things are
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity, integrity, integrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell people all the time, kill them with
kind bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we're in Ukiah and we've
been there since 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the first dispensary and nowadays
there's, you know, 10, 15 more spots
[SPEAKER_02]: within a square mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't worry about it, even though it
is worrisome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see cookies up there and they're for
sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just so many spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I tell people and I welcome them
every time they come is just be nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be nice to your people and they'll come
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what kind of competition
you have because pretty soon it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be like that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a thing to be afraid of because
it's America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just tell someone not to open,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So New York's going to feel that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's going to feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nothing to fear as long as you
have integrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm getting excited for
interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how far away we're from
having interstate commerce, but I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're close.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing Snoop and a lot of these
people really start stepping it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're seeing like the THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're building like the train tracks for
the railroad to run on, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're close.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to have some kind of interior
knowledge, having invested in the European
[SPEAKER_02]: medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody's telling them what to do and
helping them guide their decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like they have at least a little
bit of an edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything's positive in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, we've waited so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about California,
we've been doing this since 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they were to let us have
interstate commerce, that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody bought the USPS, which is
going bankrupt and let us use it to ship,
[SPEAKER_02]: that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had a cannabis bank, if somebody put
15 mil into a federal credit union for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, it'd be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things that force like
farmers, the permitting and all the rules
[SPEAKER_02]: force us to take another look at our
labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how can we reduce labor?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest ways to do it and
what's happening is whole plant fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: frozen because you don't have to harvest
your cannabis in the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to spend time curing it,
drying it, trimming it, paying a trim
[SPEAKER_02]: crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just freeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a manufacturing facility at
our dispensary in Ukiah and we can process
[SPEAKER_02]: a farm in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have a product that's,
the quantity is reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's higher grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll keep for longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can decide if you want to put it into
an edible or just sell it as hash or turn
[SPEAKER_02]: it into rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on trimming
machines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like trimming machines personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a friend of mine complaining
today about how all the dispensary herb or
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of that he was buying is trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've used them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you grow so many thousands of
pounds that you just have to use them or
[SPEAKER_02]: your weed will like rot before you have it
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it like the comparison to me
is it makes it look like your weed is like
[SPEAKER_02]: a year old outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can take a piece of fresh
greenhouse that just looks better than any
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just glistening in the sun with so
many trikes and compare it to something
[SPEAKER_02]: that you tumbled on a machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't even compare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you have to pick the right strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you want a strain that's kind of
chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a strain that has like a
lot of smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it has a lot of shape to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the trim machine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I hated trim machines up until last
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw the resonator work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been building them since I was a
little kid, like leaf tumblers and
[SPEAKER_02]: machines.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this liquid CO2 with the resonator
where it has the net like the things
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing for what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the yield, it goes way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking like, like 20 to 40% versus
like chasing five to 10% on whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh frozen or 10 to 15 when you're just
say like you're freezing your trim and
[SPEAKER_02]: running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: $20 to trim a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: $25, $15, depending on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way less even.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have trim crews.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's still, you still need people
to operate those machines, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need an operator and someone to like a
clipboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I'm talking specifically the
resonator because you do use the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's the cost of that plus,
and, and, but I really like TJ and the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, it's actually pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome to see people just moving
forward and not, you know, staying on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting edge, but also just making things
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when people try to be creative
and they're able to do stuff that benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've also learned not to say,
fuck that sucks, you know, cause maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: this version does suck, but down the road,
it's not going to be that blurple led
[SPEAKER_00]: light anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to have an LED light
that's amazing or feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone hated feminized seeds when we
were younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hated, hated, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like people had negative
experiences or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they either came across a herm or
they weren't educated enough about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't run feminized seeds yet,
but something I'd be into, I'd be into
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a collab or getting that 4Z
feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cause many people want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even just selling seeds and breeding,
people have been asking me for feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the last 20 years, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you start with stable genetics
and you make feminized seeds from stable
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, it's a trait that can be bred in
or bred out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed it into regular seeds just
as easy as you can with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain strains have a harder time doing
it, but it doesn't mean that you should
[SPEAKER_02]: run from the challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just up breed it and go for it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There definitely is a demand and you have
to listen to demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really important thing in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have people asking you for
something, you have to listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you have a dispensary and people
want a certain product, you may not like
[SPEAKER_02]: that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: People may be like, Oh, why do you have
jeeters or why are you carrying STEEZY?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have customers asking you for
it, you have to run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember starting and we had only
organic products and we had like 50 jars
[SPEAKER_02]: of flour and people would come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had four gram ace and you could pick it
out of the jar yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were in heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then slowly like rosin and pen started
coming in and all these regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really see like a lot less quality
herb, honestly, as it's commercialized.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get great flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can get great flour, but in the
average person, if they know where to
[SPEAKER_00]: look, they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, too, if you're the average
person and you're going to dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever state you're in, you're trying to
figure out which medicine is good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you try all the different ones,
which isn't cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you finally find one you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear this story a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got to try the whole gambit
again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, people want the same thing
every time they want the same response.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for them to chase it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've been smoking 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you liked when you were a
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you see it again,
it's almost like you have a photographic
[SPEAKER_02]: memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, anyway, for any strain I've ever
seen since the beginning of my life with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I register it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what it smelled like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even like wet moldy batches of crypto that
came in from Florida and mail order in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that even, you know,
but I definitely remember the good ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that one that just you're in the
dead lot and you score some Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even before all these strains,
like in the 80s, you could get some Thai
[SPEAKER_02]: stick or Colombian or just, you know,
just Thai that was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, mind blowing, you know, one hit and
you're just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I remember all the different
genetics and we didn't even have names on
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't necessarily named.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like good green or kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had kind bud, green bud, sexy,
maxi or pretend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican brown weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, yeah, we had the brown, a lot of brown
weed that was seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and even, even some of that
stuff was actually really good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like the, the more, the higher
end Mexican that was actually really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was still pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like sass or bus head or many
names.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd get blocks of it in the hood,
man, from the Jamaicans growing up back
[SPEAKER_02]: East.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was basically our staple,
but the bad stuff would give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have the worst headache afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or give you cramps or like, you could tell
something had been sprayed or something
[SPEAKER_02]: was wrong pesticides, but man,
I smoked so many good dime bags out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hood that just made me laugh for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would give you just giggle juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it'd be creeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like nothing was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden you're just
permagran and just laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your ass off for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I rarely see that because it's not the
shiniest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like an old school sativa that,
you know, people aren't really wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow indoors or outdoors, but when you get
it, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the creeper, you know, that effect
people want such an instant gratification
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they want to exhale and just feel the
weight of the world's going off their
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get that, but there's
something about good creeper weed that
[SPEAKER_00]: kicks in after 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still, I got some of that last
year from Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huckleberry hill farms and that stuff
literally, it was a batch of his mother's
[SPEAKER_00]: weed and it literally, I took a bong rip
and it didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took another one and I think I took a
couple more and like literally 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: later I was on the couch and I'm like,
man, freaking eyes got tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of those slow creepers,
not like, okay, after I took a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: bong hits, I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, man, that shit didn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then literally five minutes I'm like,
Oh, I feel a little bit high.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 minutes later I'm like, I feel great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 15 minutes later I was like,
wow, like borderline too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that kind of effect, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cannabis in general, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like any kind of land race or as
long as it's organically grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a hard time even judging
some of these events where they throw 40
[SPEAKER_02]: different kinds of hydroponic cannabis,
like in Europe or Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anywhere where you're judging
sometimes, you know, you really start
[SPEAKER_02]: paying attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're like, man, I smoke organic
weed everywhere I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Budge Laro?
[SPEAKER_00]: You try the pearls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love the pearls.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're upbeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, like a rare stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to help him market that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, it's hard to educate people
and get people in the consumer point to
[SPEAKER_02]: respect tiny little pebbles like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Dr. Greenspoon, but I love that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm a hyper guy and that stuff makes
me more hyper and I still love smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every time I see that dude,
I'm like, what can I do to get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of those just little pebbles?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Bubba Kush is really good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a couple of good Bubba Kush
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked what he said on the show about,
and I agree with him about how it's just a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful thing to just give someone
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, many times I've given someone my
last nug and I'm talking like really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor organic head stash from seed grown
in only water with no chems or new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like just really head stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, you know, I always knew
another bud would come my way,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's something to be said about
just giving someone a nug, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when it's like the best nug
they're ever going to get and a nug that
[SPEAKER_02]: you respect and you just kick it down and
that's like a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's local.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what he's done with the sour his
sour was dead on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's kind of chasing the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some in the drawer right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing with the sour is like that not
that he's fighting it, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the nose is slowly fading from the sour
you saw in like the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same like popcorny lime green
with the pinkish hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what everybody's wanting,
but the nose is slowly delineated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the first person I've had express it
correctly in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas actually the actual expression I'm
looking for, and it might not be
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically different than a lot of the
other ones, but because they're going,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think like they might be drifting a
little on the nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be, but I feel like his is
dead on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: His is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: His is the one when I smoke it,
I get the same effect that I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same smell, same look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nostalgia is just there, you know,
and it makes me smile even just thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the hermogran.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, it was so big when
it was big.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't even understand that if you
weren't there, it's hard to describe how
[SPEAKER_02]: big it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the original New York city
diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We crossed with it and it has that loud
sour nose, you know, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the sour is the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have nothing, you know, that's a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can chase it all you want,
but you're always going to get something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so, you know, what's funny is with
cookies, we haven't seen good cookies for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been getting asked by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we Fino hunted some from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best ones, my friend, you know,
it was a loud sky is platinum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platinum, which is loud, loud scale,
platinum cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frigging, we got a dead ringer for the
original, original cookies, like dead
[SPEAKER_00]: ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, man, this smells like 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell like the cookies you see
today because I feel like they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: either watered down versions, crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people try to breed it up because of
the low yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was this strain in Ukiah in the
seventies and eighties called the brand Y
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people swore that that was like
sometimes called the black Mamba,
[SPEAKER_02]: but many people said that was like the
backbone to the cherry pie that went into
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was those small little pounds that
looked like a football that after you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you're like, oh man, these are hard to
sell or I don't want to grow these again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that cherry pie to some of the
lower branches would seed or herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a difficult strain,
but so tasty, just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a pound of cherry pie people,
you could smoke the whole thing to your
[SPEAKER_02]: dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a lot of the cookies in the
beginning when the form cut was raging,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd grow it and it was it was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an odd phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd get bigger yields off of 600 watt
than you would off a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you backed the sun off of it outside in
the shade, you'd get five pounds versus
[SPEAKER_02]: like two or three pounds in full sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have these massive leaves the
size of your torso and it'd be kicking out
[SPEAKER_02]: tiny little popcorn nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, remind me of like an old school
G13 or just some old school hash plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that grows like a foot of stem and then
gives you a half gram nug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just hands down the best smoke,
you know, but I think the cookies faded
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just partly because it's so low yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you when you're growing it,
like when I'm growing it next to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: my stuff, you just want to break it off
and throw it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't yield, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's why we bred with it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was to improve the yield because the yield
was so bad, you know, and then I often do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use my lamb because it's so bright and
so big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take anything from anybody's catalog
and just they have a dead on genetic that
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, but I just want to boost the yield
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who are on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you cross them too?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have that original male that I made
the dirty skittle with just because that
[SPEAKER_02]: lamb is just the backbone, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what made the skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dirty skittle is like 37 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a big jump on an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just every time I cross it back,
like when we made the four Z's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just still right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four Z's is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me some flour at Turpnami.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a sativa too that was a heart
raiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was a heart raiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's like when I think of original
haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only haze I've seen in years
that smells like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the hazes have that African land
raiser, like a Durban or Jack or a fruity
[SPEAKER_02]: nose to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that that that haze just put me down,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up to J Trees on that one because
yeah, that's just perfect cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and you don't see hazes like that
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were in an event where there
was 50 different bags of and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking all that weed and that still we
couldn't finish the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Arion was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, Arion was blown away by the
amount of haze, you know, coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe where haze is European.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think of haze as being European,
even though it's California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: For years, let's say the last five years,
even I've been like, just because the
[SPEAKER_02]: downfall of Jack and Durban, people
weren't into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having a dispensary and paying
attention to the market in the last year
[SPEAKER_02]: or two, people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the top of the order list.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love a fruity sativa that they can
relate to, like olfactory wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just like looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open the jar, it does something to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than just loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a time and a place for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's good sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: History repeats itself too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those oldie but goodies are never going
to go out of style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles ain't ever going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with these hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will never go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think cat piss is one where I
hope it comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants that skunky cat pissy,
just that foul odor where like something
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that nose burning skunky ammonia.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: This limo G is like mint windex.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're still just chasing the
like, I got sprayed by a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we got some old seeds to
open recently, some 87 new old stock using
[SPEAKER_02]: this, that C section, the seed section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technique where what happens with an older
seed is there's something, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, you know, the outer shell and
there's a cotyledon, but there's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like a sub fascia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it does is it recedes over time
and it makes it so that cotyledon can't
[SPEAKER_02]: open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you, if you have old seeds and you,
you smush them after they don't open for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit and you see that there was
nothing wrong with them inside,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're wondering why it wouldn't crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking about after scarification
and jill berylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you can do is you can actually cut
the seed open with a razor blade and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the cotyledon is held shut by almost
like an acorn, which was that sub fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has receded to a little point and
hardened and made it so those old seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: can't open.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you cut those with a razor blade and
you'll be missing a little bit off those
[SPEAKER_02]: first two cotyledons when they finally
come up, but they'll come up even with
[SPEAKER_02]: like a 40 or 50 year old seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done this really, and you just keep
it wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, you know,
they're good because you put them into a
[SPEAKER_02]: cup and they sink, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not floaters no matter what age
they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, okay, this is like,
this can work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I found is with the really old
seeds is they'll turn like to male or like
[SPEAKER_02]: the males have a better survival rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something about the males are a little bit
stronger with age.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's time or heat or
something that makes more males of the
[SPEAKER_02]: older seeds, but I know that with this
seed section tech, I can get anything to
[SPEAKER_02]: open and it opens up and those first two
leaves are missing what I cut out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to put this to the
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some seeds to send you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got these ones to open from 87.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use GA3, we do scarification,
we do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, hormones and then try to do them
in vitro, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I'm always interested in
trying new tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use like hydrogen peroxide or what
kind of water is distilled?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a 6 to 1 with water and hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and we soak it in that and that
sterilizes the outside seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and everyone has their own way
of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in my book too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the coolest part in there is,
you know, I mean, you're reading it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing they got, besides the genome
project, but you've seen they got a 2000
[SPEAKER_02]: year old seed to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means like we can find,
we can get civil war era seeds or seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are in medical kits that are dug up,
you know, to pop now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they, they found that frozen
lady in a log, like in Russia,
[SPEAKER_02]: some super old jar of nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that it all goes back a
lot farther than anybody thinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've been here a lot longer than
people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think herbs been here a lot longer than
people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, we use like these certain fines
to base the whole creation theory on like
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard Leakey or homo habilis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say it's a lot older than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's say maybe during one of the ice
ages, you know, we didn't get totally like
[SPEAKER_02]: wiped out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a couple of people survived or maybe
there's just, it goes back a lot older
[SPEAKER_02]: than we thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like cannabis, I feel like people
have been cultivating it for a lot longer
[SPEAKER_02]: than we think.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it does grow wild everywhere,
but it very well could be that people
[SPEAKER_02]: planted those fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it has the ability to adapt to
an environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much every environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can adapt just like we can adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's here to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take it back before the Bible,
biblical time, whatever, you take it back
[SPEAKER_02]: to the root, to the dinosaurs and it's
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're reading, there's goats,
there's herb, there's humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like part of the story here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it has a survival mechanism
where the plant will produce a seed for
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let them go long enough.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll produce a seed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a survival mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant is going to probably be here
long after we're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something on that note, being from the
East coast, we've always just been chasing
[SPEAKER_02]: fast seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking for the cotyledon roots per
under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and some of the strains we've had
are like 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two benefits of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have a super fast strain,
but in nature, why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that strain will be done in 30
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by 45 or 50 days, it'll be pollinating
so that it can continue and like seed the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it was like, that's the
purpose of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get it and breed it,
that's what we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have that four Z's is 40 to 45
days and people have a hard time believing
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not an auto flower has high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tell people, be ready, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you have a new cycle,
I mean, that thing just gets huge
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly and deals with he, it deals with
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we've not only bred it for bug
resistance and temperature out in Potter,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's 130 degrees all summer long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the winter where it's like 20,
30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have just unbelievable temperature
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can tell like the year the Russet
mites ravaged us, there was plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: just didn't get touched at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you look for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though you haven't done the work
and you can't prove it on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, genetically what the work you've
done, you know, you have a strain that is
[SPEAKER_02]: bug proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like a citronella candle
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's getting eaten alive and this
thing's just thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell people not only pay attention to
your climate and like where you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow it, but pay attention to the plant
that's saying, Hey man, I'm taking care of
[SPEAKER_02]: myself or I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if something's thriving in your
climate, don't try to force it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to grow like perps or something
that takes forever in a zone where you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to have a quick crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're on the coast, bust a
quicker crop, you know, with four Z's
[SPEAKER_02]: we're getting, you know, five to six
rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where people are getting two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn real quick because that is one
of the best places for stress testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the tritus powdery mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things, you know, I got to give it
up to the farmers that are coastal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and there's so many
advantages to breeding coastal and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: testing coastal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as far as if you're testing your...
And to pay attention to where you are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you can be coastal,
you're not going to be able to grow most
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can want it all you want, you know,
and you're also not going to want a late
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering harvest because unless it's
bulletproof, you know, you're just going
[SPEAKER_02]: to end up having so much loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're pheno hunting,
the coast is great because especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a necessary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can do it to a degree
indoors, but it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bred for, you know, 20, 30 years
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one advantage to it is you can,
you know, I'd be getting seeds at Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup and I'd already have run it two times
before people are like growing it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm already giving you your
feedback without having to wait the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a good control group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you have your seed mom
room and my veg room, and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: budding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're flowering it and you can
do two or three cycles or five or six a
[SPEAKER_02]: year, and you can really see with a
control group because the environment is
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outside, even in your greenhouse,
there's different sections, different
[SPEAKER_02]: heights, different wings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's too, it spreads it out so much
that it's not as much of a control group.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have just like direct indoor
breeding set up, I feel like you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: so far ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm big on pheno hunting for where
the seeds are going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be selling clones to
people that are growing indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should probably pheno hunt indoors,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be growing and putting
the seeds out in fields, you need to test
[SPEAKER_00]: them out in fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like really depending on what
the final use is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, we can go into like,
is it a hash strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be used for flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be used for pre-roll where
people don't care what it looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going in that direction of
the cruciferous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where it's like wild mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're turning into all these things,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always go 24-7, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, dude, what do you
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always veg 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have for like 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, nah, dude,
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always have this conversation with my
farm, my crew, and it just grows so much
[SPEAKER_02]: faster, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's mostly indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that involve from a High Times article
that you read when you were a teenager?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember reading that in High Times,
the 24-7 model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, you know, like we're,
I was in High Times Best Of In like 95,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I was an avid High Times reader,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just when I moved to Boulder and I
lived in Boulder from like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 92 to like 99.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was just there growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I learned most of my
indoor techniques, you know, and just like
[SPEAKER_02]: we were using Rockwell and taking clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm still using that same clone
technique and it works amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can clone something in like six to 10
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where it, where it
originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about your secrets for
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for cloning?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to give away.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I give away my best stuff every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give my best genetics out there and
force myself to make better stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell people like, don't hoard it
because then you're not sharing it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't help anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're only taking a few
clones, I have fun with it and I'll put
[SPEAKER_02]: tape and let it marble out before I'm
going to cut it and cut it on a wider
[SPEAKER_02]: surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just get a big knob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, also if you have space,
take a big old clone, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: take the big one, save yourself like two
or three weeks, you'd be amazed at how
[SPEAKER_02]: quick it'll root and how much healthier
and stronger it'll root.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most important thing to me is that
you take it off of a, a seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: nine, 11 or 13 bladed leaf, like veg your
plant out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have to do it six to eight
feet, even if you lose time, take healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, because if you're taking unhealthy
clones or like substandard stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all these viruses and all these
things occur and it's just not worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I only take topical meristems,
you know, I know it's easier to take from
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom if you're hedging and you want
to trim the unders and not throw them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are usually like the sicker or
more viral or have bugs or not that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have bugs necessarily, but even with the
hop latent tests, sometimes the lower
[SPEAKER_02]: plant has it and the top doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as if the plant is trying to grow out
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would just give it a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you just veg it out and get it just
healthy and luscious and take those
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, all of a sudden it's like,
you have a different stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing that and your friends are
taking other cuts or clones and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering what you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, no, man, I just took a
healthy clone and threw it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important to take healthy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think healthy clones and depending on
where you cut the clone and how old your
[SPEAKER_00]: mom is, you don't want an old mom either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you just fed it and good in,
good out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're replenishing our mom stock every
four months, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, at most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no more old moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four tables and every month the
table gets replaced, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through that and we go from
tissue culture moms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want as healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even in a sterile environment,
we try to prevent cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem, I mean, not a problem,
but one, one thing I've noticed when we
[SPEAKER_02]: grew, we grew tissue culture out at the
farm and we got the highest yields we've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ones that we let go a little
bit seeded lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was odd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed it had very smooth stem,
like none of the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was never a cambium layer on the
stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it grew, it was like, it was almost
like just a smooth stemmed plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing about taking a tissue
culture and putting it outside is if
[SPEAKER_02]: outside is where the viral area is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about the cannabis crop
as one big crop, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from like the up in Oregon and
Seattle and California, if you look at it
[SPEAKER_02]: as one big crop, it's hard to fight,
you know, what's outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like chem trails and neighbors,
or if you're, you know, in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California near vineyards, there's fires
and all the bugs are hopping on the birds,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are hopping out and over your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's an argument for if
you're taking a tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is almost like less strong,
you know, and you're just putting it out
[SPEAKER_02]: in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times it has a better start
because it's cleaner, viroid wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it won't have as good resistance to
what's actually happening outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus what's happening outside just happens
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can start with it fresh and all of
a sudden it just goes out and gets
[SPEAKER_02]: diseased.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's like, you just got to keep
a good eye and not be afraid to throw out
[SPEAKER_02]: a percentage of your veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even if it's five or 10%,
if you have enough plants so that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: notice something that you don't like,
don't be holding onto that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're short on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go take that to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cause you need a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid to get rid of it,
you know, cull.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to do sometimes if you love
cannabis and you're attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, but the best, the best growers out
there grow more than as far as they veg
[SPEAKER_00]: more than what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take more clones than what they need
and they select the best ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's just across the board
with the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I line them up on a paper slicer and I put
it under water under a big, shallow
[SPEAKER_02]: Tupperware full of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put a paper slicer in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can take a thousand at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started doing like, you know,
10,000 a day, just really clone it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind is like, Oh, how can I just like
line this up better?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't FIM or cut any leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're asking how I clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't cut any of the fan leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like that like disturbs it or
it's like having an open cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of like, you know, that's the
first time I saw that was when I moved out
[SPEAKER_02]: here in 2010, I see people just jamming
domes and cutting leaves and cutting half
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves just to make it fit 50 on a,
on a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing like a 50 cell count?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do 72, but only plug half.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fifties just work so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you start doing thousands and
thousands and thousands, you're buying the
[SPEAKER_02]: seventies and spreading them out just
because it's financials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fifties are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to get 20 bucks a clone and we get
a thousand bucks a dome for those fifties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just slicing them all day,
you know, of the Lemo G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've been doing trials and we've
been noticing that the one and a half inch
[SPEAKER_00]: cubes get better results than the twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as far as we get faster rooting,
we get wider, thicker, healthier roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's imagine a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like VP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're, you're just, it's drying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's able to feed more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like aeroponics or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting more oxygen to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just bubbling all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed I grew hydroponics for like 20
plus years and we would make our own
[SPEAKER_02]: setups with tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like an aeroponic with the nutrient
film.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first we were spraying the bubbles
onto the roots and then the roots were
[SPEAKER_02]: just clogging the whole tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have to put the holes where
the roots weren't just to aerate the
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you notice you can get the thing,
you know, those plants would eat 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would leave the CO2 on accidentally
sometimes in the dark and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: contrary to popular belief, like I believe
plants can digest CO2 in the dark,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause we, we accidentally leave
a tank on and it would just empty and we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: turn on the lights and it'd already be
just perking and growing almost like it
[SPEAKER_02]: was digesting the CO2 or like slowly
releasing it, like a late release
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen, keeping it and not digesting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was going to ask you what you
think about like photosynthesis as a fact
[SPEAKER_02]: to like anthocyanins beating like the
virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like we have plants sometimes that
the top will be green and the bottom will
[SPEAKER_02]: be purple or the part that gets like less
sun will turn purple like on one piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's very genetic specific,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the cultivar, because I see a lot of
stuff and I can use an example from indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation where everybody's using these
LEDs and their stuff is kind of purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that purple, but it has that
purple hue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the purple that trims off
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then they get to fave and under
canopies, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a lot of that far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden the bottoms are
more purple than the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think a lot of it has to do with
the light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say they're also saying like the
nutrients, like what you feed it can boost
[SPEAKER_02]: anthocyanin count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, obviously air
temperature, like you're- But in respect
[SPEAKER_02]: to it, you know, beating the Hoplatin,
you know- Why it beats Hoplatin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that Indian study, that study out of
India where they were saying- I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a few of them and I'm not
sure exactly why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're still all trying to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really interesting in the
direction they're going in and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've identified the anthocyanins
and the relationship to Hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's, it's amazing because I
feel like we're one step away from being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to breed it out as opposed to,
you know, you can, you can treat it with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do mirror stem tissue culture and
you can basically, you're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: outgrowing it at that point anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can even like block alleles,
like some of the Israeli studies where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like blocking the ability to mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point it's borderline GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there is a line in my mind for me
anyway, like whether you're going to use
[SPEAKER_02]: CRISPR or like I'm an organic gardener,
organal, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would rather grow organic food than
grow chemical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing is for me, I'm not
opposed to CRISPR and I'm not opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: other people doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do data driven breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collect as much data as possible and
that gives us the, you know, the best
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to breed in the directions
that we're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important thing is data,
man, because if you don't have that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like whatever you're doing,
wherever you're growing, record it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're monocropping, like see the
difference so that you know your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best things you can do on a
large scale commercial farm is just get
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself a set of flags, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have a bugged area,
mark a red flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an area that's not getting
good water or is over water, mark a little
[SPEAKER_02]: blue flag just to set a little flag so
that you won't lose sight or control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get yourself a clipboard, be organized,
of course, but know the areas,
[SPEAKER_02]: flag them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they're better, remove the
flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helps you like be able to handle
a large area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're just one guy running a
10,000 square foot farm, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Californians are doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting your ass handed to you,
you know, and you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been doing it your whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is still challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that helps, which I really
recommend we have more forums and people
[SPEAKER_02]: sit down, not just on a business
attribute, but really like helping each
[SPEAKER_02]: other instead of shutting each other out
or saying, oh, I found a secret and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to use it to get ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about everyone benefiting so that we
can all work together because when we shut
[SPEAKER_02]: each other out, man, we're really just
handcuffing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've perpetuated this situation,
which is like a bad domino effect of
[SPEAKER_02]: negativity when no matter what,
you know, whatever drama you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever cannabis enemy you think you
have, it's much worse than someone outside
[SPEAKER_02]: our cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting over it and just working
together is the most important thing we
[SPEAKER_02]: can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just now when things are rough,
but remembering that when things get
[SPEAKER_02]: better because they're going to get
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, cannabis always get better and
they're going to get worse again and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wants us to remember that we have to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so tell me about this cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought this awesome chem dog cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, Greg G from the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the ones that remembers the
lamb from the dead lot from back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: eighties, which my wife is always like,
get people to remember that you've had
[SPEAKER_02]: that lamb going forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I was so psyched.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some 87 seeds to pop,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just that you were younger
and had better taste buds, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally the bud was amazing back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were trying to see if some of these
older seeds and some of the fascinating
[SPEAKER_02]: thing about using that method to open
older seeds and what we found to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful is that those older seeds don't
have the virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm not saying if you introduce it to
the crops, they're not going to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: virus, but that older stuff just wasn't
around, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that it's skunky and neon
glows in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you were a kid, you had weed
that stands up with the weed today,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is amazing because we didn't have
labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just breeding by look and smell
and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I mean, you don't have to
overcomplicate cultivating and you can
just do it.
And I mean, it's just a lot of motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept it simple a lot of times back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started in the 90s,
the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the late 90s, it started
getting really complex with recipes where
[SPEAKER_00]: people were really putting a bunch of
inputs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the guys that were growing three
part, a lot of guys just did three part
[SPEAKER_00]: and got really good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's from just GH three part
for like 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew up on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were bred on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, there are so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not viscous and it can flow through
any hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at most you're adding pH up a gallon
every few days and it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, you know, you're not
realizing what you're missing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know if it's, you're like maybe
short people think Cal Mag, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in reality you might be like a tiny
bit short on copper or something that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you just add that three part mix,
it just takes care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just whatever, whatever problem
there was just goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people used to grow it in soil,
you know, with three part with the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: mix, but it's hard because you're not
flushing those heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you become like a chronic sore or
really into cannabis, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: taste that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no getting it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, the living soil
movement, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great, but it doesn't have as
much of a flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the organic farmers that actually
flush just are over the last two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, which people are like, you know,
some people are against the thing with the
[SPEAKER_02]: K and F and the living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think it's better if the whole crop
is one crop, but when they're mixing it up
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have like 10 different phenols in
one room, it's hard because like the turps
[SPEAKER_02]: digest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And off gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just like, it ends up all
tasting the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever have that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever see that where like one farms,
all the different strains will taste
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many guys up North or the,
you know, you could tell the Gua they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using seagull shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can almost smell the new, when I'm
tasting just from judging all these years,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm smoking, I'm like GH,
you know, mills, you know, you're like
[SPEAKER_02]: house and garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just know by the look and the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Athena has a very distinct flavor,
you know, and it's regardless of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think of it or not think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everyone has their own opinions,
but it's, Athena has a distinct,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's the best looking stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks amazing, but you can,
like you said, and people should know
[SPEAKER_02]: don't buy like liquid newts, you know,
in ag and in bulk, especially if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: a long range plan, buy the powder mix your
own or copies, you know, you can just,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like when we were kids, we used to
go, they didn't have growth stores and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd see something and instead of buying
it, you just build it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just reproduce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, look at the formula they're
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Source the nutrients that you need and
just buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, and a lot of it's the grower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, it's like, you can have
the worst girl in the world and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what he's using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably going to be bad,
but then you have to hear the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't, like, if you're not hearing
them, like you don't have to listen,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the plants will just talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not hearing them, you know,
then it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was bagging on Rockwell a while,
but not really bagging on it, but like
[SPEAKER_00]: about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my buddy's like, dude,
you know, the weed that I've been giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the last four months is all
Rockwell grown with Athena Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not always just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always nice to have this stuff
was absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like, I'm a big fan of
United.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the hat on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using United for the last six,
seven months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing trials and working with
them and I'm super happy with their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he cleaning it out or what was his
flush at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, what does he just feed it right
till the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, you, you got to flush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you feed to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it can give you heart palpitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when we were first started,
starting to grow hydro as, as kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we can take the biggest dreadlock
down from the dead lot with some of this
[SPEAKER_02]: unflushed cannabis, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, it was beyond expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, not, not with straight water,
but there's, you know, he used molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: and other stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think molasses is amazing,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The powdered molasses from, uh,
from the last couple of crops that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: using, I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've never seen anything like work
that well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like before you're doing your final D
leafing of your big, and you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: lose a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to a little bit of a heads up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that it has time to digest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it hits exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you remove it, it's already in
there, but I've seen just amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: like not just the Terp difference of
crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think it helps just with the yield
because you're just helping with a little
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar boost right at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that powdered molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you do Synganic or you organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're organic, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost living.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like our, our soil is out there since
2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at almost like 10 year
old living soil and just from like lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: funds when times have been tough the last
couple of years, we, we haven't bought a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch of new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's we're just like either mixing local
soil into it and just using what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've gotten amazing results.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only realized you remember when you
were a kid, there's no new companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to your local hardware shop and try
to source some lime or get some wood ash
[SPEAKER_02]: or some cow manure like, and it would
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times people don't realize if
you're on this regiment and hydroponic
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule, you can almost just feed once or
twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to just feed it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just pound it, you know, that's almost
more for like a commercial setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have just like some
plants at home in some soil, feeding it
[SPEAKER_02]: like hydro newts every day, it's not that
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing I was saying,
you know, if you have some plants at home
[SPEAKER_02]: or a smaller grow room, sure grow organic,
but on a big scale, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been doing it and it is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to have a giant organic to scale
without spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you, you definitely get
less, but it's all about integrity or what
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to do, like what you want to
provide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to me, I want to make a medicine
that's actually helping because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been more challenging,
you know, for all the farmers in Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali that, you know, big up to the organic
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of us that works with
cannabis has this opportunity to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now some people will pick money over
making the world a better place,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we all have that opportunity to get
money and what are you going to get from
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether your mom told you this or not,
but you're here to make the world a better
[SPEAKER_02]: place, you know, the sooner you get to it,
it's just like getting comfortable in your
[SPEAKER_02]: own skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the sooner you get comfortable,
the better off you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're here to stay and might as
well make the place better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've only had, we, yeah,
we only have short moments left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, as far as we're
here to stay, but we're it's our time here
[SPEAKER_00]: is so short.
[SPEAKER_02]: It flies, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned 50 this year and you know,
you know, I got a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of years before I turned
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I was a kid, I thought 50 was
so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I'm like that age,
it's like, I don't feel that old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel 18 every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a look at myself and I'm like,
whoa, what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, yeah, that's what's nice about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stay young at heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the beautiful things about
like resurrecting these old strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like time travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of a sudden you got a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're smoking out when you were 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I had that limb, when I was 12,
there weren't a lot of people that had
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis that were at that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get anything I wanted with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three backstage passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just own the dead lot with that
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were moving pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when we were moving outdoor
pounds in Boulder, we saw hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds, but not at that quality,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That quality was always, you could even
give it to a farmer when you were buying
[SPEAKER_02]: weed off them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be like, Whoa, what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people didn't have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the outdoor farmers didn't also
have indoor setups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go down to work, big growth,
trim crews in New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Colorado, and I'd bring some indoor
that I'd grown in Boulder and people were
[SPEAKER_02]: just blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this kid in the trim tent with like
a pound of indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, good weed can get you places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always has been able to get you places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's the thing is what people
don't understand is there's lots of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always been a good amount of
flower except for when there was droughts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the quality, the good stuff,
the amazing, that 1% stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now you're looking at the 0.1%,
but back in the day, it was like 1% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was really what I thought was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get people forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very small circle of people that
have like that heightened respect or level
[SPEAKER_02]: of knowledge for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember calling into the high
times cup a couple of times saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, how do you guys know that something
65% and 35% and they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a deep pool of internal knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got me laughing because it's kind
of like, when you look at Gregor Mendel or
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these geneticists where they're
saying you're 25% of your mom,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25% of your dad, 50% of mix of all these
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, kind of, you know, it's not
exactly 25%, you know, you don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's 21% or 26%, but it's not always
exactly that number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's the same with breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, people are looking for
these like homozygote or to homogenize
[SPEAKER_02]: things kind of, and really like,
I think you're looking for the hetero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're looking for that, the outlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used to throw 2000 seeds in these
little Dixie cups and just go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to see so much genetic
expression over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed so many different things to see
what was dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like blue dream, 90% dominant with
anything you cross it with, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's so stable, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you do get a lot of good,
yeah, banana terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll literally take over any terping
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cross, except for mean genes,
black line, like literally like you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: cross it with something and you're going
to get those banana terps shining through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a dominant terp crosser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to find out like the results,
you know, what's happening if you cross
[SPEAKER_02]: something into something else and.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I'm most into now is getting
those old school land races with the THCV,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the alleles for that right hand throw
for the sports figures and Parkinson's and
[SPEAKER_02]: just, just making real medicine that can
get somewhere quicker than people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: doing five or 10 year studies to get
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they may not be showing all the
work, but you actually have something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's more, you know, a better medicine,
let's say not better, but more usable than
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug's varian or like some of those
strains that came through to the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: but either were a little seeded or not
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just didn't make it, you know,
they're not still around really.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see like THCV or CBD dominating
the, the, uh, the white market space or
[SPEAKER_02]: the retail space people are asked for it's
around, but not like it was when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when like the rage of CBD, you know,
was, uh, like when the gift, when the gift
[SPEAKER_02]: came out, Ringo's gift and the sour Sue
and some of those crosses people,
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew a whole crop that summer of just
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have those, they're dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just get those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just toss a seed and there it is,
you know, you're like, Whoa, sour Sue,
[SPEAKER_02]: so dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something to be said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember growing those and we have like
a blackberry and a blue dream and we saw
[SPEAKER_02]: many strains that were super high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dude, the blackberry coach was the
pretend to go though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, it was Bud Light for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked amazing done in five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and saw this farm that had outdoor
plants and it was just, it looks so
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, walking up there, these black
plants and I'm like, Oh, it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: shiny diamonds, you know, that does
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got so excited because I'm like,
I'm coming back to buy some of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got back, we smoked it and
I was just totally like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened a couple of times going up
north.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a tolerance at all,
it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was a rage though.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rage was one of the strains that
really started PMing pretty hard,
[SPEAKER_02]: like right before the green crack and when
it's tested 8% to like, that was like
[SPEAKER_00]: super low.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the really high turp strains,
man can have like really low THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why people have to,
we have to reeducate or just unlearn this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing about THC because there's only
so much room in a molecule anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're, if you go for the highest
THC, it's so rare that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the highest turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it almost never happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, there's a handful of things
that test really high in cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: also really high in terpenes, but it's few
and far between.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the banana, the banana when,
you know, it's, it's so THC high,
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA high when you, when you make whole
plant fresh frozen out of it, it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a malleable white clay as opposed to
a strain that has like liquid turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that one has that banana turp and
it can hit super high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times, you know, people just
get confused and they need to remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you just smoke a bowl and see
how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more important to see how it's grown,
you know, like that it's grown with
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity or, you know, that it's good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem with a lot of the
edibles too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using like distillate or like
low grade booth, it's not really medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and people are going to get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have like older people coming in or
someone who's already sick who can't
[SPEAKER_02]: afford to get sicker and they're getting a
product that's making them sicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that's really not what it's
about, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to avoid that or else we're
going to end up in lawsuits and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things that will hamper us from bringing
the medicine forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that's important too,
just to have integrity as the DCC is like
[SPEAKER_02]: banning all these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obvious that like people are just not
keeping it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's really unfortunate that
they're, you know, the whole Delta eight
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that we had guys that just decided
we're just going to convert all this hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: into Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my opinion, there's no bad
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's bad people out there that that
are doing things that are just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate growing a plant is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't tell us what kind of tomatoes
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just, you know, not the whole
thing is just ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just raise the tax and raise
the tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, you start wondering
like, what's the plan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the plan to just make everyone bankrupt
and corporate comes in and buys everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: out because they couldn't have built it
and they couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you got to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind everybody we made this,
you know, they can't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can just come in and buy us out and
they can only do that if they force us all
[SPEAKER_02]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we remember that we're the asset or our
passion is the asset, like Sherb says,
[SPEAKER_02]: remember that and like light it up,
keep it in your heart chakra and just use
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because if you get tired or you
let them beat you down or you say to
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, man, how am I going to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they'll end up winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to just turn it around even at
your lowest points and just be like the
[SPEAKER_02]: canvas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan will provide, you know, that's what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are fighting hard out here in
California for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at cannabis is,
you know, that used to be 6,000 a pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say for 30 years of my life,
every pound I sold was six grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden cannabis is much less
and everything else is up, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just the cost of food, gas cost of
living out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you have to get really smart,
make a pie chart, know what your
[SPEAKER_02]: percentages are, know where your cannabis
is going before you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you better have good quality flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you will not survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, if you're not at the top,
then yeah, don't even, you can't even make
[SPEAKER_02]: it to step two or three or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even worth doing it anymore
unless you have the best genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best flour, whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you don't love it, don't even try.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't wake up thinking cannabis,
don't even bother, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're here just for the money,
there's way better ways to make money
[SPEAKER_00]: these days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way easier ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go chase something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much more out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our two rules on our farm, you know,
may they be rough or not, or just smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and don't be a pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just stick to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hard, you know, I don't mind when
people don't smoke cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they need that to focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me to really understand it and
part of the disconnect with the DCC and
[SPEAKER_02]: these other groups is that they're not
cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they haven't helped us move
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like recommend to people get
involved in your local government before
[SPEAKER_02]: you're forced to do it on the ground
level, get in there, talk at your board of
[SPEAKER_02]: supervisors meeting, know that you can
unseat a mayor with 50 votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like get in there and make yourself a
voice and activate with your community so
[SPEAKER_02]: that later on five, 10 years, like what we
learned down in line in California is
[SPEAKER_02]: they're overtaxing us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could have avoided this by telling
them from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't keep the tax model that we had 10
years ago when we were thriving for what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a failed government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to like keep it fresh and new,
like half have representatives in your
[SPEAKER_02]: board of supervisors, have a relationship
that you can talk to the mayor and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, listen, we need to keep this
lucrative for everybody, not just a one
[SPEAKER_02]: way where we're just getting taxed and
we're not benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's really important,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole tax thing with the excise tax
going up 25% is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reasoning behind that,
not that, you know, Newsom just does this
[SPEAKER_02]: every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, he's just said that we didn't
come up with the revenue because basically
[SPEAKER_02]: we're chasing people out of here with the
permit fees and the taxes anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, you know, they're just going to
raise it and it's going to go up to like
[SPEAKER_02]: 19 or 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going up 25% of what it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they may even raise it to 25%
eventually, because have you ever seen
[SPEAKER_02]: them lower a tax?
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't lower taxes in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they abolish them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope we do more of that,
but you know, they don't lower the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's another one of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They removed the cultivation tax,
which was basically unconstitutional
[SPEAKER_02]: taxing a crop before it's sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not that I'm a federalist, but that's
just not constitutional.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wherever the thin line of the laws are,
it's just frustrating because really
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone who paid cultivation tax for all
those years should be able to have a class
[SPEAKER_02]: action suit and get all that money back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spannabis Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the culture, the vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like how they run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how they give you the first booth
you were in for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people know where to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be Amsterdam for me,
like the melting pot or the gathering
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it really just kind of transitioned
into Barcelona and you got to love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just amazing for anyone who hasn't
been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Spannabis was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I went.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold a lot of books.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the three packs over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they like the three packs here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's our biggest seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's more affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually, you're bringing something
like a lot of people don't have more than
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 or 30 bucks, but they want a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first time I started seeing
that in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are just like, can I buy one
seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just like, whoa, this dude actually
wants one seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants one seed.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he just wants to do what he can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always given more seeds in my
packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll give 20 seeds per pack and I'll
even give like buy one, get one just
[SPEAKER_02]: because bottom line, I want people grow in
the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want them to have more, you know,
I'm not going to give them a hundred,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say, but I don't mind giving an
extra because if they're not growing them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you're just hoarding them and
people aren't growing your strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: then where is your strain really?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're not sharing it and
putting it out there, like, how's it ever
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be known?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like that was, we're,
we're at fault for hoarding genetics back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day, you know, and then I saw guys
like, it came from keeping secret or
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping quiet from the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to share it with everybody
and let our stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw us winning cannabis cups with
genetics and other things and us not
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the good stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got these guys with the
gorilla glue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won the cup and at the same cup that
they won, they gave the seed, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, but they gave the clone out to
literally everybody that wanted a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they might've sold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like 2014, we sold like 2,400 seed
packs at the Emerald Cup of gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the only ones that had the gorilla
glue seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you had the gorilla glue seed back in
2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just had them for sale and they
were just went viral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the people just ate it alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you cross the gorilla glue with
something else or you Yeah, we crossed the
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, when we started seeding
the gorilla glue, it started like having
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was so much cracked out of
that, that you got to see like where it
[SPEAKER_02]: came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like some Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it smelled like, like hot licks or
fireball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy, chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's really complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like And it's just so dang
christally, you know, there was like two
[SPEAKER_02]: versions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was quick and one took a little bit
longer, but it would like hang from like
[SPEAKER_02]: so much resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just took over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of like made everybody stop
growing the sour for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were growing just sour and it
transitioned into gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly why the sour is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trim nightmare, you know,
that when the plant, you're trimming sour
[SPEAKER_02]: and the plant's actually talking to you,
it's actually telling you, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually telling you stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't know because you're a
trimmer or you're working or your boss is
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, you know, but in reality,
the plant just doesn't want to be trimmed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, especially that West coast sour
D that was just, you know, it's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: harder to get into and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never got good West coast sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never, we had, we had sour diesel and
that was it right in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was like an AJ's and there
was the West coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw from the West coast was smaller
yielding, but way louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were selling it at dispensaries
and there was a West coast, but I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it had hot plate and it was like,
and then my buddy even tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like all the diesels carry it and
all the older strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, blue dream, it won't test
for it a lot, but blue dream is so old and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I haven't seen it get sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow some every year and I always have a
little patch of a hundred pounds on the
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sells in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like amazing resistance just cause
obviously some of them put the work into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these, these guys who are out
there and pollen chucking and it's awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: when you take two things and I love
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when people take things and mix
them and try to get something better or
[SPEAKER_02]: something they like, but you got to
remember like, you know, do the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like blue dream is, is so good because
somebody put a lot of work into it first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it has the longevity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, you know, you have to really do
the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool to mix some someone's work with
someone's work, but a lot of times can
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that stuff indoors first growing
indoors, greenhouse and outdoors and do
[SPEAKER_02]: your research on it before you just
release it because otherwise you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to profit off something and giving
someone, you don't even know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: giving them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self coming into the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I would take it,
but I'd give it to myself just like not to
[SPEAKER_02]: be so trusting and to remember that,
you know, sometimes you think someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing or you're really just projecting
what your own beliefs or core values are
[SPEAKER_02]: in a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just have a better filter, uh,
not to sound harsh because you could waste
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of time just like having a lot of
heart and diving into something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but cannabis is difficult cause it's
all brand new, you know, every now like
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the permitting, some of the
initial processes that we got into,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially we didn't know where it was
going to get permitted first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we set up permitting in Mendocino
and Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino was rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to shut the permitting down
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of like humble, there's somewhere
where they're accepting it and just
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing this is what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, there's a real dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the richer landowners that are
trying to shut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand, you know, they're part
of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crime, which it doesn't, they just need to
be educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has to remember to just join the
conversation because if you can't talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: people, it just forms separation and you
educate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell them they don't want people
driving around in their neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell them this is farming,
this is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're harvesting wine and you're
harvesting pears and grapes, you have
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not creating crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're here to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're working, you know,
but it's, it's a hard argument,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially Mendocino where they give the
cannabis tax 5% of gross from us to the
[SPEAKER_02]: crystal meth task force.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a problem they can't solve
and we shouldn't be responsible for,
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like any cannabis tax is, it just makes it
so difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: You almost wonder what is the purpose
because nothing else gets taxed like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a medicine, like we're essential
during COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the price we pay for having
legal cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So asking to be regulated before we have
formed lobby groups and we're working
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why if you're out there,
one of these burgeoning States are just
[SPEAKER_02]: starting off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Form alliances early, get in there with
your local lawyers and activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, don't pay them necessarily
offer them a percentage, but get on an
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative where you're moving in a
direction that you won't, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: get into a jam one year, five year,
10 years down the line, have your plan and
[SPEAKER_02]: project, look ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you're in it and you love it and
you know, you're in it forever,
[SPEAKER_02]: see ahead and try to project like out here
for us, PG and E has all these rate hikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get solar and get solar quick because
seriously know that if you want longevity
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're a solar farmer or a cannabis
farmer at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solar with it because they're going to
increase your cost of production by so
[SPEAKER_02]: much eventually that it's going to start
hurting on top of your labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like know that you may not want to trim
your whole harvest, put some of it towards
[SPEAKER_02]: an edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause edibles are the only thing that's
gone in an increase in value in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, flour and everything else is
depreciated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a candy bar and let's say a Kiva
bar that was five, six bucks is like four
[SPEAKER_02]: or five times that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think edibles are a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can keep it organic,
that that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like get your product, let's say on a
whole foods shelf in five or 10 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just have a projection or a vision of
where you want to take what you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: and just stick to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody knows just what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people know what's good and
what's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are looking to find out more
about Lem from Lempire Farms, where would
[SPEAKER_02]: they go?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, you know, the dispensary in
Ukiah, Compassionate Heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been there since 09 and the IG
Lempire Pharmaseed and the OGenius is the
[SPEAKER_02]: OG line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So contact us on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just DM me and you can get right to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm available 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's like two in the morning and you
want to eat somewhere and just hit me up
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always available for tips or like any
kind of questions or feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like bothering me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm up at two, three in the morning
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't sleep a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of 4Zs coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping to do a collab even with you or
we want to boost it and get it into some
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries so that we can make it more
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a lot of orders for like 10,000,
20,000 and our nursery is small.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only producing like five,
6,000 per season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we've been successful
without having like Viroids and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how good it would be,
but I know there's some good spots out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, Radio Ridge and we've had them run
our stuff before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solid people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid people out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan and Eva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jordan, Ryan and Eva doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got really nice, healthy stock and
it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend just getting them from one
spot and not getting clones from a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of different spots because you never know
what you're getting, what you don't see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see someone in the street,
you don't know if they have a cold or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing with plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant could look amazing, you know,
and then you put it with your other plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't even know what it has
because they haven't even found out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those eggs don't hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you got to be so careful when
you're introducing new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why seeds are so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just start fresh with your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need clones from anymore that
you can get hoplating from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to know your source.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we went, that's why we opened
those 87 like Super Sativa Seed Lover
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and some Sensi Seed Bank Skunk One
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We opened a bunch of different ones and I
was betting or just preying on the Skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: One and that's the one that did well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, it is just the stank of dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, it's so fun showing
friends of mine that haven't seen it in
[SPEAKER_02]: like 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Sam the Skunk Man for all
your contributions to our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're talking about,
we're talking about so many of the legends
[SPEAKER_02]: out there, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Franco, like just so many people that
like, you know, they basically paved the
[SPEAKER_02]: road that we're walking and driving on
today, you know, and some of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: still around like Cheech and Chong and
some of these guys are still out there
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it and just leading the way with
integrity, doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed, Jorge, Robert Connell Clark,
all these guys that stood up for the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: on so many different levels too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's guys standing up in court
for the plant, guys writing books,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys writing books before it was okay to
write books where, you know, you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble for having them.
Yeah, education is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: George Van Patten or Jorge Cervantes or
Ed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel Frank, Jim, Jim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel Frank, big time putting out the
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education is the key, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in the industry or in retail,
if you can just take a minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when these dispensaries first opened,
it was more of a medical approach and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd spend 20, 30 minutes with somebody
trying to see what they needed or putting
[SPEAKER_02]: them in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can go so far in establishing a
relationship with a customer that's more
[SPEAKER_02]: than just an in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you treat somebody like they're
going to be there for the next five or 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go a lot further with them if you
just listen to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these people, believe it or not,
are coming into the dispensaries like a
[SPEAKER_02]: third of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never been in one before.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a brand new customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've probably never even been exposed
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need more than an initial like
introduction or education.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just, they need to know like they're
there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant energy brought them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like whether it's the fact that they're
putting their pharmaceuticals down or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is, the cosmic energy has
brought them to where they are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just have to come in and just
learn, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's up to us as stewards of
the plant to keep it organic and keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, because people don't understand
the destruction or damage you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're putting something on the shelf
that's actually like destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, or putting something in your body
that's poison and people are doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're already sick, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it's like, yeah,
it's like what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening with us with just health,
colorectal health.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're eating poisons on top of all the
chem trails and graphite in the air that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to just like fight to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to be so conscious,
not just of the cannabis you smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: but of the food you eat, the way you treat
your body, your mind, keeping it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's challenging, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a cannabis farmer, you have to know it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just like knowing plumbing,
electric.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It delves into like H.R.
[SPEAKER_02]: and emotional IQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know, I have 15,
20 people working for me and I never knew
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to be dealing with like their
relations and their interrelations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a broader scope.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you upscale, you have to be ready for
things that you weren't planning for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's part of the American dream,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a big bite out of the
cheeseburger and sometimes you choke on it
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually you get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly what you plan,
but you get what you wish for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, be careful what you wish for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say just dream big, you know,
go for it, attack it and it'll come to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the people who want to get into the
cannabis space, even though it's crowded
[SPEAKER_02]: or it may seem challenging, if it's where
your heart is, dive in, man, because
[SPEAKER_02]: people, we need you, you know,
any kind of love energy is lasting and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be here for your whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, thank you so much for coming
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the amazing cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some rosin here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that for Z Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, let's do the skin sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
