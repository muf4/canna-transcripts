[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is James Loud and today my special
guest is Luke Scarmazzo.
[SPEAKER_06]: He spent 14 years in federal prison for
owning a legal dispensary in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing today, Luke?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm exceptional, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, James.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, really, really glad to have you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've been out of prison for almost a
year now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost, about 11 months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your journey going from legal,
you know, and I can't even imagine,
[SPEAKER_06]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild that it went through what it
went through, especially because you had a
[SPEAKER_06]: legal dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you were breaking the law
and you had some spot in New York where
[SPEAKER_06]: you were selling everything out of your,
you know, your bodega.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were trying to do it by the books and
you were trying to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a little ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the reasons why we didn't
think we were going to get that much time,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when, after it all happened,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is we were like, okay, it's the cannabis
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, we're following state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were paying our taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, everything was above board,
completely legal in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like, you know, what,
what are we going to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probation in a few years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government doesn't give out
probation or a few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They decided to throw the book at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: 22 years is what you originally were
sentenced to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 21 years, 10 months is how the fed
sentence you in months, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get it, when you get it and
you walk into sentencing and the judge
[SPEAKER_01]: sentence you, he goes, you know,
scarmaza, we're sentencing you to 262
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you got to like sit there and do
math, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I'm like 262 months and I'm
like, Whoa, wait, that's like 20 something
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't really even get the exact
number it was when he, when he initially
[SPEAKER_01]: said it, because it was, I just was like,
well, it's 20 something years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's already way more than anyone,
any one of us could have fathomed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the real fight began after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 14 year fight, the 14 year fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a whole different battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we, we met thanks to our mutual editor
for, I have my book coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your book that's out,
which we have right here, the high price.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Angela Baca, big shout out to Angela.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for all the help.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's dive back into.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you got your start with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that was a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of, I did like a Quentin Tarantino
to you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started at the end of the movie.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my start in cannabis was really when I
was born, I guess, if I really back it all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way up, my dad grew cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I can remember it, I've been around
cannabis in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our neighbors grew cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I grew up in California in the
nineties in Modesto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, every, it was all around us,
you know, so we were immersed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew my first cycle at 15, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like a sophomore in high school
and the first, the very, it was an NL
[SPEAKER_01]: five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even get to, I got it to
flower, but right when I was about to pull
[SPEAKER_01]: it, my mom found it, yanked it,
said she said she threw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my dad ended up burning it down,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was my first, that was my first
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in love with it ever since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then just continued to kind of
like, you know, back to then it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were growing on the outlaw,
you know, we were growing in houses and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, renting houses out and kind of
staggering them and doing, and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of doing whatever we could to keep
certain genetics that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it all changed when we started
getting the medical cannabis laws in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we kind of saw like a different
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in 96, it passed early,
but there wasn't a whole lot going on
[SPEAKER_01]: early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was, it was very gray area at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wasn't like, there was no real,
real like legal, legal shops that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bay had like Dennis Perrone had some
of the, you know, the early, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: AIDS patients clubs that they had and
collectives really, really early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of your legal shops really didn't
start coming around until like the early
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in around 2003, I'm going to get legal
on you real quick, but the Rache decision
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down on the ninth circuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it basically barred the DEA from
raiding anybody in California that was
[SPEAKER_01]: following medical cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we kind of, the medical cannabis
laws were always there while we were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing outlaw and doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were always, everybody was always
kind of leery of them because the feds
[SPEAKER_01]: could always come in and Trump state law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did many times, many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that decision came barring them or
as an injunction, I think back then with
[SPEAKER_01]: Angel Rache going against the feds,
the federal government or the DEA,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they got the injunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so we sat down and we were like,
wow, now this opens an opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we can open, it's like an easy
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like in a field I already have a
degree in, now they're offering a position
[SPEAKER_01]: in an emerging market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sat down, my partner, Ricardo
Montes, shout out Ricardo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a big fan too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we sat down and we
initially were like, okay, like let's,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's explore open in a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talked to one of my friends,
he's, he's kind of working at a doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: office in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in a building where they had
to, they had the doctor's office on the
[SPEAKER_01]: second floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third floor was the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the name of the third floor
in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he says, look, if this is what you
want to do, come over here and check this
[SPEAKER_01]: spot out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, there's not a lot of them
around, but I got like, I've been in over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at the doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, we'll, we'll get you all squared
away and you can go up and check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, I go over there, I meet him in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk in and I look, you know,
we walk upstairs, it's like all dimly lit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big bouncer on the, like the front door,
you know, and you're walking in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, first experience on the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't know what to expect,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like walking in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk up the stairs and when I get to the
top of the stairs, it looked like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a mom and pop spot, like a,
like a, like a old coffee shop,
[SPEAKER_01]: but on the board behind them, it's not
beans, it's cannabis all behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, and I sat there and like,
they had like a little like seating area
[SPEAKER_01]: where you could consume and smoke and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the setup was, was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the left, they had all these
like clones and, and all the genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were selling and all the cultivars
that they had going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sat down at the table and just kind
of sat back and just wanted to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I sat there for like an hour and
watched this spot just go through people
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and people walk out happy and,
and the atmosphere was like really
[SPEAKER_01]: eclectic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like people from all walks of
life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, everybody, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a mix of everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anyone you could think of from the
skater to the rock guy, to the football
[SPEAKER_01]: player, to the whatever, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got back, I talked to my partner and
I said, Hey, we got to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is our dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this, this is it right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this week, we, we, we can really do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, all right, where do you want
to do it at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, the central Valley,
those of you that don't know the central
[SPEAKER_01]: Valley, the central Valley is like the
California is a blue state, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The central Valley is like the pocket of
really high conservatism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very red, very red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like the only counties that
voted for Trump like consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do, it's always been like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's changing a little bit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I will give, give them credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that are working
hard to, to, to, to make the policies
[SPEAKER_01]: there more inclusive and make it to where
it's justice for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the people that are
working in Modesto to, to, to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: pendulum swing the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at that time it was really
conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we sit down and we say,
Hey, where are we going to open this up
[SPEAKER_01]: at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decide on Stockton because Stockton
is in the central Valley, but Stockton's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more liberal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we're like, okay, it's a little
rougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little looser, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go into Stockton and maybe like
they'll want some business there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to give them tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe it'll be open to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go into the city council meeting to
meet with the mayor and the city council.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within, I don't think we got four
words out before they were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, not in our city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're like, well, that didn't go
exactly how we thought it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were kind of expecting some
negotiation maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, Hey, this is where we want you
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a dead no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go back to the drawing board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go back to our attorney at the time and
we say, Hey, this is what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he, he was very knowledgeable
about the cannabis laws back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, you don't have to ask the
city to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as they don't have like any
bans or anything in place already,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to get the city's
permission to open a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to make sure that you go
through all the correct processes and get
[SPEAKER_01]: the correct licenses and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we just open in Modesto then?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our home city, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we have the most love,
the biggest support, the biggest network
[SPEAKER_01]: of growers, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decide to open Modesto and man,
it was, it was a hard decision,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it almost felt like the people who
were signing their names to the
[SPEAKER_01]: declaration of independence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're openly defying what you got,
defying your, your federal laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're openly defying the community norms
and we're on the main strip in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big target.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big target.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what people don't understand is if
you didn't do it and people like you
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't do it, it wouldn't be that way this
day today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think, you know, there's
sacrifices that people had to make for us
[SPEAKER_06]: to have legalization and people tend to
forget the past or they, they,
[SPEAKER_06]: they remember what they want, but not
necessarily the important parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the memory is short, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, especially like my
daughter's generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use her as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jasmine, I love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're probably tuning in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my bad for putting you on the spot
here, but it's the other, like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: her generation, she's 21, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew up knowing nothing, but
legalization really.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew up knowing all the stores on the
corners and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't really even understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she does, of course, cause she went
through it, but you know, that generation
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't understand like what it took to
get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even the bud tender, your bud tender
that you walk into a dispensary right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 21 through 30, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: That main age bracket and, and they don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's interesting when I go in
there and I get to like talk to some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud tenders or some of that generation
and, and just kind of talk to them like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yo, like to get to where we're at today,
like we had to do, like we had,
[SPEAKER_01]: we showed up to work every day,
not knowing if we were going to go to jail
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or get murdered or get shot or robbed or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a totally different time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pioneers at that time that really
put it out there, my hat goes off to them
[SPEAKER_01]: because they took the risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their families took the risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what the crazy thing is,
James is a lot of them are still in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are still in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty wild that we can operate to the
extent we can operate legally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's still people locked up for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, yeah, there's a lot of things
that are counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't make sense on any level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the frustrating things to me
as I was sitting in prison during that 14
[SPEAKER_01]: years, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And watching the industry grow because
like I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passionate about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like watching this progress,
like as a cheerleader, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'm watching
corporations and governments bank millions
[SPEAKER_01]: of dollars on the same thing I'm sitting
in a cell for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing a few thousand other
people are sitting in a cell for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really it was like I had mixed
emotions on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm like sitting there like really
championing on the industry and the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, because I know that as it grows,
it becomes more accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the more people see the benefits of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it was it was a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so you went through the appeal
process and that was that was a fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fight as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we opened the dispensary for like we
run it for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the city begins to do like a
litigation against us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, look, what we need you to do is
tell us what it would take to recoup your
[SPEAKER_01]: costs and then some and the amount of time
and we'll give you that amount of time
[SPEAKER_01]: unharassed to be able to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, we have to agree on a
date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was I was like, that's not that
doesn't even sound agreeable to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just recoup our money and like tuck
our tails and get on our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the communities out here like
supporting us tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to these city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like a city council meeting
has like 20 people at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These city council meetings have like 400
people at them so much that there's people
[SPEAKER_01]: in like the overflow outside, like
watching on the monitors when we're having
[SPEAKER_01]: like anything cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was like tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the city wants us out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what they end up doing is they
realize that they're going to lose in the
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They realize that we have really solid
case law behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were we were doing business before any
of their bans or moratoriums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically decided, hey,
if we can't get these guys out of here,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to call the feds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on my daughter's birthday in 2006 on
Jasmine's birthday, the feds raid us in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning at like six a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: with machine guns coming in, kicking in
doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like if you watch like a
documentary raid in like Fallujah or Iraq
[SPEAKER_01]: or something, that's how that's how it was
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all black tactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crazy thing is they knew I was
there by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was it was total overkill,
overreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was typical of the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how dispensary owners and operators
were treated like they were families with
[SPEAKER_01]: what they would kick your door in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take your family out into the front
lawn and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, we we went through and
were found guilty in trial because we
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't present a present of a defense,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say the words medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't bring any of our tax documents
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the government, on one hand,
gets to where the prosecution,
[SPEAKER_01]: on one hand, gets to paint us as these
huge like drug kingpins that are flooding
[SPEAKER_01]: the community with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to like try to sneak in like
language here and there of, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, we were paying taxes and we had a
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and they would object and
strike the record.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was it was a kangaroo court.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not surprisingly, we were found guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sentenced to 22 years and 21 years,
10 months and 20 years for my my brother,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricardo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like I said, the fight began
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first appeal was dead in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our direct appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was really like the shot through
the heart, because that's when you really
[SPEAKER_01]: like you think, OK, I had this one judge
and maybe he didn't see it the way I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted him to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is going to a three judge panel
in the Ninth Circuit, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most liberal circuits in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, oh, we're going to get a
good shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody gives any a 20 year sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a dispensary operator like that's
unheard of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave it to me and they said,
you're going to keep it and you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, like for for the listeners that
are familiar with the legal process,
[SPEAKER_01]: forgive me, but for those that aren't,
it's a Byzantine maze of like motions and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you lose your direct appeal and you
go off on your own now, now there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: legal help anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're just in prison and you either
learn the law or you hopefully you got
[SPEAKER_01]: your parents or your people got money to
be able to get a lawyer that knows the law
[SPEAKER_01]: for you, because there's there's no court
obligation for you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you go through trial,
they got to provide it to attorney for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're convicted, it's game over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to spend like the first like five
years in prison in the law library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just learning the law, because I was
like, man, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still like dumb enough to be like,
this isn't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they can't do this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the irrational convictions of
youth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me sit down and learn law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to do it the old fashioned way,
like not with computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got, you got to a book and then
you got to one part of the case and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it said, go see this other case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had to set that book down and then
you had to go back into the library and
[SPEAKER_01]: find that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that might've only been like a
couple of sentences you needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was crazy, but I learned
like, I really learned it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I learned it the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned how to file my habeas corpus
motion 2255.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned to file 2241s and these unique
motions to try to just challenge anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got, man, I got shot down so many
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, at the beginning, I was like
real hopeful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would call home and be like,
yo, I got this in there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hopeful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, you know, something might shake and
it would get denied or it would get shot
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd have to call back home and be
like, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a few times doing that,
I stopped telling them about shit
[SPEAKER_02]: because you had so many letdowns,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You had so many letdowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I can take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't want to keep giving them to
my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to keep giving them to my
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it got to a point where I would just
like kind of do my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd follow these motions,
study the law and hopefully find
[SPEAKER_01]: something, man, that where I could,
something that where a judge would
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize the injustice of my sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I'm sitting there like in
this situation and I'm like, I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: find a way like to argue this in a
compelling way that a judge will say,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can't just go in and say,
oh, weed's legal in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how many states
legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in federal prison, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to find a way to make a judge
realize that the case, my case was an
[SPEAKER_01]: injustice on the, on its surface,
just because I was following state law and
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the changing legal landscape of
all of cannabis, even in the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government, the federal government has
evolved tremendously from 2008 where they
[SPEAKER_01]: were initially.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2014, Obama launches what's called
the clemency project, 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's seeking out people who have
outdated sentences from nonviolent drug
[SPEAKER_01]: offenses that if they came before the
court today would get a lesser sentence.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Ricardo were like, perfect
candidates, poster children for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote the motions up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I studied how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got with my boy, Weldon Angelos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had kind of linked up a little bit for
Weldon had 55 year sentence for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really knowledgeable about the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Weldon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weldon Angelos and reform brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He launched reform brand, which is a dope
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out, support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got with Weldon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wrote these petitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically had the name changed on
them, you know, because our case,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were tried together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our case conduct was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filed these petitions and we wait and
we wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, man, we got a really good
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: In January of 17, the beginning,
like the sixth or the seventh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get called into the office and they say,
Hey, sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh man, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think I might've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've, I might've got clemency
because we were just, we were,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were great candidates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had nonviolent cannabis offense,
following state law, had a license paid or
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, the list just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, we're perfect for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legalization was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was going on at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obama was, was, was doing interviews and
throwing language out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounded like real supportive of
cannabis and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were really hopeful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get called into the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit down and they say, Hey, this just
came in from the pardon attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they slide it over to me is the
denial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they don't, they don't tell you why
you're denied.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just says executive privilege.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just denied you could reapply in a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call my call home and tell them I got
denied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them to let Ricardo know just so
that he would, you know, kind of not,
[SPEAKER_01]: not, I was still hopeful for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like brace for something bad,
but just know, Hey, mine already came
[SPEAKER_01]: through, you know, this, it didn't work
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the 19th of January,
the day before Trump took office,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Ricardo gets granted clemency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was one of Obama's last acts
and he called it Ricardo's sentence,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, unfair and outdated, but not yours,
but not mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote, I wrote the petition there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally just had the name changed
on the top of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know whatever, like it goes
through a crazy process that hopefully the
[SPEAKER_01]: justice department and everybody over
there can get streamlined, but it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a mess right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a seven layer process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super bureaucratic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can end up on any kind of career
prosecutor's desk and get denied at any
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it, it, that was like,
oh, so in 2018, bear with me in 2018,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Trump passes a prison reform bill
called the first step act.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say Trump passed it, but it was a
bipartisan thing and it, and the Dems had
[SPEAKER_01]: been working on it for a long time as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, it was passed with everybody
coming together and buried like in this
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation is this like unknown statute
called 3582, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, and this guy sends it to me is
he's an attorney on the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Luke, I think there might be like
a back door in this like piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation that they pass that allows
prisoners to directly petition the court
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise you don't have a way to
get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you go through your direct appeal and
your habeas corpus, the court doesn't hear
[SPEAKER_01]: you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't send them anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just keep saying, Hey,
let me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once you've exhausted your appeals,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the court, you have no,
what they say is you have no vehicle to
[SPEAKER_01]: come in back into court.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was that vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now in 2018, after California has
their rec laws going and we have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, multiple years of the Rohrbacher
bar appropriations amendment that bar in
[SPEAKER_01]: the DEA and the, and the or the department
of justice from using their funds in
[SPEAKER_01]: states where cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we have a series of things that
have happened in over the course of the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years that's making it to where I
think now if I present it before a judge
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do it in the right way, like I said,
in a compelling way where I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily only argue cannabis,
but argue it in a way where the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is the main foundation of this injustice
because of what's going on in the whole U
[SPEAKER_01]: S today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a, I had multiple people help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Edie Learman over at Emerald law group
helped, um, filed a excellent motion on my
[SPEAKER_01]: behalf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filed the initial motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Edie filed, Edie filed a motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then we're kind of waiting and a
huge law firm called King and Spalding
[SPEAKER_01]: contacts me and they asked to come on to,
to, to help out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a godsend and they send
this lady to come on and help me named
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrie Dent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Carrie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweetest looking lady you would ever
meet.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to the law, she is
vicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she went in and demolished the
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've never seen like such a one-sided
like battle in motions before seeing how
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrie like just went in, just like kind
of just dismantled like every point that
[SPEAKER_01]: the government was using to keep me in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lo and behold, after she came on,
um, to make a long story short,
[SPEAKER_01]: brother, it, in February 3rd of this year,
I was released from prison because of
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrie Dent, because of King and Spalding,
because of Edie Learman, because of
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom grow, because of LPP, because of
mission green, because of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: glass house, because of, uh, beard bros,
because of everybody, the entire community
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and apologies for anybody I miss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I miss a tremendous amount of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably do your whole show
thanking people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no, no lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the community that came,
came behind me, I was able to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just because I found that
motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody shot that to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, I filed it and then the
community got behind me and attorneys got
[SPEAKER_01]: behind me and they were able to get me
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the greatest feeling in the
world, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I got to hug my daughter,
like on that night, like I flew,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, I was in, I was in a prison in
Mississippi, a place called Yazoo,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yazoo city, Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it sounds like what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just say that it's like 50 years in a
time warp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like small Southern, um,
like the way they incarcerate people is
[SPEAKER_01]: different in the South.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different culture and a
different mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say that to say this, I was ready to
leave when they said it was time to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put me on a plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fly back to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fly into Sacramento airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meet my daughter at a Denny's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first, my first time seeing
her in so long, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had, she, she came, she was one
of my biggest supporters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love her to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came up and visited me, you know,
throughout all those years, but then COVID
[SPEAKER_01]: happened and then I got shipped out of
state and then I got shipped to Louisiana
[SPEAKER_01]: and then to Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time I actually ended up seeing
her, it was, like five years since last
[SPEAKER_01]: time I had saw her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a really emotional moment,
but like I said, it's the best feeling in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's, let's talk about COVID because I
think COVID was pivotal in a lot of ways
[SPEAKER_06]: in the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I read some really interesting
things in your book, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: how you wrote the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think that that's pretty
impressive if you want to go into that,
[SPEAKER_06]: how you got the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a really interesting
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up in solitary a lot during my
14 year period and you can end up in
[SPEAKER_01]: solitary for anything like solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll put you in solitary confinement
for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few times was for a dirty, dirty weed
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did like my, my first dirty weed
test in prison was in long poke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I did like 75 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it the shoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sounds it's an acronym, SHU and secure
housing unit is what they call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's solitary confinement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They throw you back in a cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your food comes in a slot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go out of your cell,
you get one hour of recreation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but recreation isn't like a dog kennel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a really small like cage,
like down the hall from your cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't really ever get to go out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no like sunlight or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have a window, but it's
painted over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's artificial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so it's a rough existence torture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think, I think in 50 years
from now, like they will deem it torture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I had always wanted to write the
story high price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was always in the forefront of my
mind, but I got frustrated when I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have to try to write like a 10 page essay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, dude, I don't want to write
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, how am I going to sit down
and write like this book, like this story,
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, cause to sit down and write
this story, I knew it was going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, try to sit, try to force
myself to sit down a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got like 10 pages done, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ended up going back into
solitary and this time it was for like
[SPEAKER_01]: seven months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sitting in my cell in solitary and
you like books are your lifeline in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you have books, you're pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can sit there and read maybe like
workout for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write a letter, read some more,
like it kind of makes it to where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: break your day up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I run out of, I run out of books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't catch the guard coming
through with the book cart, which they
[SPEAKER_01]: come whenever they want to really,
then there's no way to get it other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they play with the mail back
there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not getting mail for like a week
or two weeks or three weeks at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I run out of books and now I'm like,
all right, I got to figure something out,
[SPEAKER_01]: like something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to occupy my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, man, I wanted to write this
book this whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting down in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like, I felt this like,
it might sound crazy, but I felt like this
[SPEAKER_01]: presence that just saying like,
yo, this is for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is why you are in here,
like to sit here and do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right, this is what I'm
going to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make the agreement with
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get deal with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to
say I'm going to write four pages a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care even how they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to force myself to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to write four pages a day and
just see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like after like, you know,
two weeks, I got like 40 or 50 pages
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting on the side of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like looking over there and I'm
like, I have something now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like something real now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm kind of getting like a little
excited now at my, my writing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like one to like four o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm getting excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm like, okay, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw, I just keep writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after like a few months back there,
I finished and I was like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, hold on, let me back up
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I skipped one of the most important parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that first day I figure, okay,
I'm going to write this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I write my four pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a reason that I say I'm
going to write four pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cause that's all they give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only get four pages of paper back
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't think it all the way through
at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I'm going to get these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start writing my book and get
these four pages out a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you only get four pages a week and
you get two envelopes and you get one
[SPEAKER_01]: little flex pen, like a little half,
like clear pan that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bends so that you can't kill anybody with
it or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I run into the immediate problem
that I'm going to be a out of paper really
[SPEAKER_01]: fast and then be out of ink, like shortly
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way you get paper back there is
like the orderly comes behind the officer
[SPEAKER_01]: that's given trays out and he like pushes
a cart like once a week and gives you like
[SPEAKER_01]: some supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pens, you know, writing paper,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I slide a note to the orderly and
the note says basically like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need more pens and paper in this cell
and I'll pay you for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, just let me know whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, everything is, everything is
for sale in prison, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you have money, it doesn't matter
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's going to try to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he says, he sends me back and we call
him kites, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sends me back a kite and it says on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For two lunch trays and one dinner tray,
I will give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: However many, however much paper and pens
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, I mean, I don't really have a
choice, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to hurt to not have to two
lunches and one dinner in a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's all the food you get like
you're and it's not a lot like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you really the food is crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything you heard about prison is
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a lot either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, I was, I was hungry on
those days, but I now I had the plug on
[SPEAKER_01]: the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would come by like on the times when
he was supposed to give like me only four
[SPEAKER_01]: pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd slide like a whole notebook under
there and then like a whole handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I would just cut like keep
stacking them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I got the material to even
write the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to trade my food for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, so high price,
like, trust me, like I want to give it to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give it to you free,
but it costs a lot to write that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_06]: 420 pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but then my last problem was
once I finished writing, I had to figure a
[SPEAKER_01]: way how to get the pages out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you, you, you're not supposed to
have like an excess amount of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: In solitary, like they come through and
they'll do cell inspections and they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're supposed to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was real worried about like somehow
losing this manuscript now that I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't even go out to like the
little recreation cage, like when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: time to go out, because that was usually
the time they would come in and shake your
[SPEAKER_01]: cell down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't going out to wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm like folding it up in like,
you know, bundles of 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like sending them out to my good
friend, Georgine arson, shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Georgine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was so intricate in making this book
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: She sends it to her friend, Jenny,
Jenny Mcmines and Jenny like was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: transcribe my chicken scratch handwriting
on this flex pen and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: solitary confinement paper into like
something on a computer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she initially said, Hey, look,
I'm going to give you like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be somewhere around, you know,
like, you know, a thousand dollars or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Da da da.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't hear back from her for like a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hits me back and says, hey,
it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what do I owe you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking like, oh, man,
I'm going to have to like figure out a way
[SPEAKER_01]: how to get this lady some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she says, you don't owe me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, after I finished typing that
story, she said that it affected me so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, I just want you to win and I
want you to get out and I want you to get
[SPEAKER_01]: home to your daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Jenny too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was she helped make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Angela had like stepped me
through it all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela Baca is a saint.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I can't say, I cannot say enough
about her, enough positive things about
[SPEAKER_01]: her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is like such a selfless person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what she did to make this book come
out, it was a heavy lift, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she did it and she was there every
step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's helped me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't, if it wasn't for her,
that book wouldn't be sitting there on
[SPEAKER_01]: that desk right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Angela Baca.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in the same place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like she made my book a lot better than it
could have ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's also the single most organized
person I've ever worked with in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you noticed that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like, but see somebody like
me, like I need that because I'm probably
[SPEAKER_01]: the single most unorganized person that
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her and I are a real good workforce
because I don't stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just keep working.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if I have to stay up all
night to do stuff and she's very
[SPEAKER_06]: organized.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's able to rein me in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I just want to keep working.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, okay, but we got to do
this organized and you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's great having somebody like that on
your team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it, it was a godsend, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it, man, she's, I can't like,
again, I could, I could praise her for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of your show, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she's that, she's that good and she
will be family for life or L.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, your book, uh, you just recently
released this now on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people want to get it, they can go
on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can purchase the digital copy or they
can get the, and it's, it's very
[SPEAKER_06]: reasonable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little over $20.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think the good read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, listen, we're really excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got up to like number 26 on the social
activist bestseller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's kind of like subcategory of
a subcategory, but listen, I'm climbing up
[SPEAKER_01]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're doing all, I mean,
this is just one of the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's, it's one of the,
it's one of the things that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an important story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like honestly, and this might,
this may sound ingenuine to people or
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I could, if I could make 10 million
people read this story and not make a
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar from it, I would like, because
it's, it's that important of a story to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not because I'm in it or because
it's part like I'm the character or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's, it's from an error that
we need to make sure that we don't forget
[SPEAKER_06]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of times these days,
people are afraid of reality for one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing, but, but it's really important to
look at reality and to understand what
[SPEAKER_06]: reality is, because there's a lot of
different perspectives out there on these
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, this is what can happen to
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in a legal system where it can,
on a state level, it can be legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can go in and the feds can take
everything away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is America, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't grow up in our like
elementary school saying, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, if you follow state law and you pay
your taxes, you're going to go to prison
[SPEAKER_01]: for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just, it doesn't jive,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, even when I'm sitting in
there in prison and they, we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brittany Griner situation and she's
finally freed, thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but the whole time the
administration is sitting there calling
[SPEAKER_01]: her unjustly detained.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you got like 2,700 people
unjustly obtained here in the U S like my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my actual sentence or my, my, the length
of my sentence was dictated by the 1988
[SPEAKER_01]: crime abuse or drug abuse act who guess
who liked the chief sponsor was Biden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, that's why I was so hopeful
with Biden because I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: he wasn't my first pick, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think he was anybody's first pick,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if I would have picked
any, but my point was like, when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when Biden took office, I was hopeful in
the sense that because he was a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: that wave of mass incarceration and the,
the crime bills and all those things that
[SPEAKER_01]: were passed, you know, during that time
that he was uniquely positioned to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to say, Hey, look, we got it wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the chief sponsors of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's fix it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I think Obama had a chance
to change it on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trump had a chance to change it and now
Biden has a chance to change it and
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody's changing as far as presidents.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think there's people pushing
for it, but there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing against it, which is really,
you know, and it doesn't make sense
[SPEAKER_06]: either.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at it, nobody should be in
prison for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's both sides of the aisle
agree about that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could take the most conservative,
like take a very conservative Republican,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Mike Lee, Senator Mike Lee,
Tea Party conservative out of Utah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then take Cory Booker, a liberal
Democrat out of New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: People shouldn't be in prison for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so when you have synergy on that,
on both sides of the aisle, like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes like a no brainer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason, like it just keeps
getting kicked down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole time it's getting kicked
down the road, there's kids that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to visiting rooms on Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole time it's getting kicked
down the road, there's other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: doors that are getting kicked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other people that are being
pulled over and sent to jail that day and
[SPEAKER_01]: losing their jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like, when are we going to stop
that suffering?
[SPEAKER_01]: When is that madness part going to stop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we can figure out all the other
stuff, the regulations, the taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, interstate commerce and
federal, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out all the rest of the
stuff, but we already all agree on this
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and it's for something that is a lot
healthier than tobacco and alcohol,
[SPEAKER_06]: which are totally legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're, you know, they're not scheduled.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're controlled substances and they're
a lot more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a lot more unhealthy than
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like night and day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like night and day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and nobody ever like goes out,
smokes a joint and comes home and beats
[SPEAKER_01]: their wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's not the scenario, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the scenario is they go drink a bottle
of whiskey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or somebody drives and kills somebody or
whatever, the plethora of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then don't, let's not even get into
the health issues of tobacco and emphysema
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might beat up some cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might beat up some cheeseburgers for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be a taco truck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fighting to get it right,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fighting to get it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, I feel like if you look a
hundred years in the future, a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: years in the past, they'd say,
we're pretty crazy right now and we're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing things the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but, you know, every day is a new
opportunity to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about like being that change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, back then, it was easy
to like, say I'm an activist and like post
[SPEAKER_01]: a picture on my Facebook and say,
oh, look, look at my plants or this and
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to go out there and grow the
whole field off the highway 20 like Eddie
[SPEAKER_01]: Lep did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to go open a dispensary down
in Bakersfield like Ramirez brothers did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's harder to go down in some
of these other spots where you have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: out on front street, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put yourself out there,
put yourself out there to risk in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: move the needle forward so that we can be
where we're at to where everybody isn't in
[SPEAKER_01]: fear of that prosecution anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's disobeying unjust
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the younger people are getting older
and the laws hopefully will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I I'm really hopeful about
that actually, because you see that stigma
[SPEAKER_01]: that like when we were young, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That dare program and turn your parents in
if they're smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that stigma isn't around for this
generation that's coming in to be
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators and city council people and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're starting to see a whole new
generation and a new way of thinking and a
[SPEAKER_01]: new way of like how, how, how do we handle
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do we, how, how does this work in
society?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have professional athletes that
are very much in support.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's ones that don't talk
about it, but a lot of professional
[SPEAKER_06]: athletes use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Diaz got a two year sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: 209 shout out Nick Diaz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big ups to Nick Diaz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, he, he basically lost two
years of his career for cannabis and now
[SPEAKER_06]: it's legal in the UFC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on 420 they put his, you know,
that's pretty, it's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, he couldn't fight for two
years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like shout out to Nick too,
because of that, because, because of what
[SPEAKER_01]: he put it on the line and, and,
and went out there, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And said, Hey, yeah, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, now he's on 420 doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he, and he deserves everything he
gets going forward from that because,
[SPEAKER_01]: because he came out and said, Hey,
look, as an athlete, cannabis use is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's part of my reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the more athletes do that,
you know, the more we can get LeBron James
[SPEAKER_01]: or somebody like that, you know,
I mean, one of the bigger athletes to come
[SPEAKER_01]: out here, you know, I think we're further
down the road on that, of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah, they need to stop talking about
cold plunging and start talking about how
[SPEAKER_06]: they smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for at least the recovery part,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like almost everybody can agree,
like loading up your, uh, an, an athlete's
[SPEAKER_01]: body with pharmaceuticals versus using a
natural plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just on the surface sounds better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the properties are so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the part, that's the exciting
part of like rec now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that if I take you back to 2008 and I
go in and I pull my dispensary crew
[SPEAKER_01]: together for like a team meeting and I
tell them, Hey guys, we're getting in a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower today that has THCV in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we got one that has CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would all look at me like I was
speaking Chinese, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we didn't know about isolating any
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have any idea of what we knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, of course we knew the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew certain strands worked well for us
and certain ones were better in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them made your heart rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them made you tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you knew kind of how to, how to balance
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on, because you were, you know,
using cannabis that often and you were
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseur, you said, okay, like that's
my nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my nighttime joint right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one right there I can function on all
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, testing screwed up a whole bunch of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not give me, bro.
It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop buying weed from THC percentages,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the biggest heartbreak to me as
I got out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I started seeing like none of the old
cultivars around that I used to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, saying, I know, listen,
I know they take 12 weeks to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know that, but they're special
and they were different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know the market is what it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to like, people like what they
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to kind of feed the
machine and do your, do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of those old cultivars that have
gotten like bread out of existence because
[SPEAKER_01]: either, you know, they didn't yield the
greatest or they weren't, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight week poppers or seven week poppers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smell too strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had them to where now we have this
like set of strands that are really like
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get a real lot of that variation
that we used to get.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's a lot of gelato and gelato
mixes and runs and gelato.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all these, you know, it kind of
happened with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, around 2010 issues when it
started and it just kind of snowballed
[SPEAKER_06]: into what it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, purple candy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what people want these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but I think the old ways are
coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sour diesel is coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuban black haze, which is an L5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: People talking about Northern light.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Fort Collins cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and maybe we won't find it in just
pure Northern lights on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we're going to find a cross with
Northern.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some Northern lights crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how it lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how we get some of those
cultivars that have been bred out for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason to be able to live on is
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, we'll, we'll meet you in the middle
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, children live on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through their ancestors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just try to make them the best
children possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think doing the selection process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good point, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, like even with what we have
with, with profit brands, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: profit brands is a brand that I'm
launching with Ricardo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're, that's what we seek
out when we do our like Fino hunts and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for what, what cultivars we want
to put.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we are looking for really specific
things that we liked back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that are buried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the central Valley somewhere that,
you know, somebody, one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: professors or one of their teachers gave
them a old school Santa Cruz blueberry or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it might like, we may have to come
meet the market halfway, but we'll still
[SPEAKER_01]: keep some of that integrity of that and
that uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what can set people
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what, as you know, as well as I
do as a breeder, that's what sets you
[SPEAKER_01]: apart is because of the uniqueness that
you bring and, and your individualism.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what brings to your breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need another runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but runs times something else.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm like a G 13 or something
might be 13 some Romulan Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got some of your runs Romulan's I'm
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's, it's a, you know,
and that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: As in adding to the diversity back into
the plant is what it's going to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to get vigor back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get, yeah, you're going to
get a lot of amazing things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was the first, first thing you saw
cannabis wise when you came back out of
[SPEAKER_06]: prison, the first strand or lemon cherry
gelato, of course, purple GDP.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got an interesting story with GDP
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, the GDP ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's like a tragic love story,
but it's nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Ken Estes, man, and what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hung out with him in it's fan of his
last year in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I actually told him when I was
in prison, I actually, we had burner
[SPEAKER_01]: phones in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or somebody did and text would
text them back or hit them on messenger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking back and forth about the
story and about like the role that GDP
[SPEAKER_01]: played in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, man, it's one, like it was one
of my, it still is, it still is like in
[SPEAKER_01]: its pure form, man, that GDP, the real GDP
is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just something special about the real GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a lot of people got exposed to
granddaddy purple and it wasn't granddaddy
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something that had color in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, or it was a seed made from
granddaddy purple, but it was,
[SPEAKER_06]: that was that one cut the real deal,
the real chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a short plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a short plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I eventually was able to find
the plug on it up in Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a guy named Jerry, Jerry
Scarborough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go up to his, my buddy Addison
brings us up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We drive up to like this, the cuts up in
Mendocino, a little town called Willett's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go drive back into like the logging
roads back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come up on Jerry's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go up, we meet him, we talk all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even talk about business at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the day,
he says, all right, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you guys, what do you guys want?
[SPEAKER_01]: He ends up having like an endless supply
of this granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like falling into a pot of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were the dispensary that needed a
supply so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm running around literally James,
like this is not an exaggeration at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The store would close at seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would run around and try to find the
next day's inventory to like one or two in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like nightly because we were
tapping every grower in the central Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: and draining everything they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were the only ones around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the only game in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like in a hundred mile radius.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only, we're the only game in
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the, one of the things I didn't
touch on either is once we established
[SPEAKER_01]: Modesto passes a ban, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't affect us cause we were
grandfathered in and then all the
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding cities pass a ban to Stockton,
Merced, you know, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the Bay area was your next
closest spot to get, to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the GDP is something special.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the effect was good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could, I could have like a car tray
full of roaches and like I would pull out
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would know it instantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Floral.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's floral gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so unique at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so potent on your lungs when you
would inhale it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, the pounds back then were
$4,000 all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you knew, like that was our
plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yo, this is 4,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking 50 of them, it was $4,000
a pound for 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't matter, but it also didn't
matter when we got it back down on our end
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think to give you a kind of an
idea, a little snapshot of like how it
[SPEAKER_01]: would have the feeding frenzy that would
happen when purple would hit like the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary back in the day was we had to
run out of purple for like of granddaddy
[SPEAKER_01]: for like a day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were just waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't get some rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always richer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricardo or I had to go up to Mendocino to
get the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were waiting for Ricardo to get back
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just that we had a delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would just come in, they look at
our board, they turn around and walk right
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had other good, we had Romulan,
we had a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had a bunch of top,
top grade strands, but they wanted the
[SPEAKER_01]: granddaddy and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally I remember, oh shoot,
I have one stashed in like the safe in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back, like on like a reserve pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, boom, I tell our processing
guy, go to the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell him where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, it's the last one, grab it,
bust it down in all eights, put a one
[SPEAKER_01]: eighth limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: On it so that you can stretch it out like
to as many patients as possible until we
[SPEAKER_01]: can kind of buy some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm thinking I could buy at least the
rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could buy the rest of the day with this
pound, like on the one eighth limit,
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 minutes.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 minutes it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm doing the math on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, damn, I paid 4,000 for that
pound in 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sold $50 ACE.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ate, we ate the sales tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't charge, we didn't charge the
patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the top price for eighths back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was top 50 bucks was top heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our top time 60, maybe 60 if you're
in the Bay area, 60 in the Bay,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could get all day, but like our top,
like if it wasn't granddaddy, it was 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't go over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for granddaddy, we were paying a
little bit more for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid 60 for cat piss back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're bringing me back with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My boy had my boy Thunder had a really
unique cut of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would, he would be able to smoke
that in like a room and you could walk
[SPEAKER_01]: into the room like three hours later and
know he smoked one of those joints in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still smells like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only strand that was like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy, but I loved that strand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's like, uh, if I had to
guess, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if I had to say my all time favorite
would be cat piss of all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on the desert Island strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the desert Island strain,
but I want the cat piss from back then,
[SPEAKER_06]: not the cat piss now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I've yet to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've yet to see anything equivalent to
what we got back in the day, but there's
[SPEAKER_06]: like several things that we had that were
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've kind of been lost along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever think like, like it's like a
kid going into like his old house,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you thought your room was way bigger
than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, there there's definitely truth
to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we remember things a certain way,
but I think your memory can be a little
[SPEAKER_06]: fickle.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like you, you want to remember
it this way, but maybe it was slightly
[SPEAKER_06]: different, but you know, who's to say
we're actually here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think therefore I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got tattooed on my chest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only reason I know you guys
might not all be real, but I know I'm real
[SPEAKER_01]: at least.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's guys theory, the theory
we're all in a simulation, all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, I, I think that there's
definitely truth to, we, we remember
[SPEAKER_06]: things differently than how they really
are sometimes, especially with flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you the one thing I still
remember rhubarb from when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_06]: I still, when I taste rhubarb or smell
rhubarb, I'm like, man, I cooking,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially when you're cooking rhubarb on
the stove, you know, cause I was a chef
[SPEAKER_06]: for awhile.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of these things are like from
childhood, especially baking with my
[SPEAKER_06]: mother and gingerbread houses,
making gingerbread, you know, stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those good memories, the warm fuzzy
memories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it works in the opposite
direction too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like strawberry boons, like wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I can't get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I smell it, I'll throw up because I,
my first time getting drunk was on like a
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry boons Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I was throwing up like
red liquid the whole night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, even if I smell that smell,
it's over with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cisco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cisco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do the Cisco.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost identical.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can smell it right now that we're
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you get those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think also experience plays into
like, we can relate an experience to
[SPEAKER_06]: certain tastes and flavors and those
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, especially cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, especially when you're young,
we got really good weed back then.
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't understand that we was really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your first, like, what was
your first girl?
[SPEAKER_06]: So my first girl was a photo Tron in a
closet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had two roommates in a one bedroom
apartment and we had a photo Tron with the
[SPEAKER_06]: top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that opens up with the lights on
the side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was all hobby stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of my buddies actually took,
and I went to go snowboarding for a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: of days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, can you water the plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told him one tablespoon of fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_06]: He thought it was one gallon of fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the weed, I tried to flush it,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually back when we thought we
could flush.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you couldn't flush the salmon smell
out of the weed and the salmon taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I actually ended up selling it to
somebody, but it wasn't stuff I would even
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was lucky enough to be in the
Bay area.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a mix of all the best genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this stuff was coming down from
Mendocino, coming up from LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were getting a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is, you know, nineties,
we were getting amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, when the gas first started and I saw
waves of the purple where the purple was
[SPEAKER_06]: hot and then the purple was not hot and
you couldn't sell purple to save your
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: People wouldn't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also had droughts.
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was droughts where you couldn't get
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be like a time where you
couldn't even get brown weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't even get the brick weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that used to hurt like, and it seemed
like, it always hit like in Modesto
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, like around the holidays,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be like on Thanksgiving,
I'd be out looking for weed instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: like being at my house with my family and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, and I'd be like anything,
just give me an ounce of, in Modesto we
[SPEAKER_01]: call the brick weed red butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me an ounce of red butter stress
for 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like give me something to smoke like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drought man was real, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drought was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had, if you had sacks in the
drought, Oh, you could kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can charge whatever you charge 60
all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you want a half house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild times.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my brother grew a plant or plants when
we were younger and we would move them
[SPEAKER_06]: into the neighbor's backyard at night when
my parents had come home and cause we had
[SPEAKER_06]: a fence between our, the neighbor's house
and put them in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my dad, when he go in the backyard,
he never found the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's, that was, I guess,
first, first growing experience right on
[SPEAKER_06]: from some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some high times, cannabis cup seeds that I
got from somebody back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a big, huge high times fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved high times magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, back then that was the magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, that was, it was like,
you like playboy magazine and you like
[SPEAKER_06]: high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was a high times guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that was way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way better porn than the porn porn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way better porn.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff was a, you know, the high times
it was, it got, it inspired me to do a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it inspired me to see just like how
people, how far people could take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like how really exceptionally grown
cannabis looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because before it was kind of like
always like, you know, most of my exposure
[SPEAKER_01]: was like either outdoor, very limited
indoor growth experience early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm talking about 90s era.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you saw in high times was like,
that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the grail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to make beds out of wood.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we'd have our eight by four beds
out of wood.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we had air cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had saw horses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and then even the adjust a
wing, the big, huge wing lights,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and air cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew with octagons for awhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and my buddy used to use the vertical
growing because we thought there was less
[SPEAKER_06]: of a vertical footprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the helicopters couldn't get us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the helicopter, listen,
the helicopter fear was real though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was real.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the helicopters are going to
get us with their infrared technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our house is going to glow purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it probably did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of good times, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, it's interesting and how it's
evolved into where it's at now,
[SPEAKER_06]: where, you know, we're like one step away
from a far pharmaceutical level,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also one step away from real egg.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're talking about like tomato
farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have a lot of credit to the
tomato farmers out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't think they get enough
credit sometimes, but tomato farming is no
[SPEAKER_06]: joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, any farming is real work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real agriculture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, hands off, hats off to all the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Thomas Jefferson has a quote that
says something similar to, don't direct
[SPEAKER_01]: quote me, I'll paraphrase is like the
people that work the labor in the earth
[SPEAKER_01]: are like the chosen of God or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's true, like you really
feel a connection when you're doing things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, when your hands are in the
earth and you're planting stuff and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing stuff and creating like that,
you feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's so gratifying, I feel like it's
a great, you're connecting to something
[SPEAKER_06]: else too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're watching, you're taking care of
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, we're all stewards of this
plant, uh, trying to make a difference and
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're, if you're working with
cannabis, whether you know it or not,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're making the world a better place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either directly or indirectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely agree with that statement for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people are looking to get ahold of
you, where can they find you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've got an Instagram page and
you get a website now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profit brands.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launch in all stores in January 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go on profit brands.com and find
what stores we launch in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get high price on amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, high price, the Luke's car Mazzo
story, check it out, review it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it, tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me that you should have been in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me that this person shouldn't have,
tell me I shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, just any kind of feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is my first book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got to like gloat over the,
over the holidays that my mom had a
[SPEAKER_01]: published, a son who was a published
author for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she thought that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, she got to kind of brag to all
the ants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're really, we're really
excited about it, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited to make sure that
everybody hears the story and just learns
[SPEAKER_01]: about that time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we sat here for a long time and we
talked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The era of when, of when you could go to
work and you could end up in jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: of when you could go to work and you could
end up robbed of when you could go to work
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could change somebody's life
because you gave them cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still keep, we, we still keep that,
uh, ethos alive and we still keep it alive
[SPEAKER_01]: with our company, profit brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our tagline is wisdom of the past
vision for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really want to take like a lot of
that legacy knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that legacy knowledge about
growing and cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's special about the plant and
meet the future with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes we need to use
technology to propel our vision,
[SPEAKER_01]: but technology is a great tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great tool, but let's, let's like
stay grounded in what our values are with
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is where we can find
some really great synergy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell me a little bit about your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard you got a really good podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I did an intro to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called joint forces with Luke
Scarmazzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you subscribe to it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filmed the first episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a ton of fun and some of the cutups
of it, you know, the intro to the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, somebody effed up and gave me a
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really mean that like they effed up
and gave me a show, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's, we're going to talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about current events,
music, um, and just what's like what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in the industry,
what's going on in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the world, what's going
on in the United States, those things
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and how it pertains to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got awesome guests coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lineup of magics from a cartel
crew VH1 show that was super dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magic has been all love to me and super
supportive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got burner coming on the second
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been super supportive with the brand
profit and with the joint forces podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have the original crew from CHC to
get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all just going to sit around and
tell stories and, and about the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: what we felt and how it looked to us and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be one, a really exciting
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Mary Jane, a comedian, a hilarious
comedian is going to be coming on one of
[SPEAKER_01]: our shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we, our lineup is tremendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, it's exciting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now I get behind a mic and I just
get to say whatever I want to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these podcasts are so important.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like getting to be part of
documenting the history is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a privilege, but also it's a
responsibility because these stories are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to get lost otherwise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like the fact that we can talk here
today and I can share your story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for me, that's really special.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, and there's so many stories
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many stories that never get
told.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least we can capture some of the
reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of what happened of the past, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so hopefully we can learn from our
mistakes and move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not destined to repeat them,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for coming on,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to you coming back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheers.
