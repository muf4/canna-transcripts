[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: and today our special guest is Parker
Curtis from Homegrown Cannabis Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today, Parker?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just recently had Nate Hammer on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great experience having him and
you work with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard him on very recently.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that experience working with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's I was a home grower myself
and growing in my spare room for about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years and so kind of working in
dispensaries and then finally for
[SPEAKER_00]: Homegrown.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't work in media to begin
with there and so I've been kind of my
[SPEAKER_00]: role has been expanding and developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've been working with Nate now
for about five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's I get to rub elbows with all
kinds of cool people in the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this industry is so community based.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, working in this industry,
I don't feel like we're working with
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrities, even though some of these
guys are big names.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of them don't have egos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as in the scene as some other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go to these events and I'm meeting
people and hearing about them for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, some people get a little
offended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't heard of them before,
but a lot of really great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to meet them passing and then I
find out who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after doing some research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it's Mike Tyson, that's one
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But guys in the cannabis scene,
it's like we're tomato farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: potato farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not special, in my opinion,
we're special in our own right for the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that we're doing, but as
individuals, we're just part of something
[SPEAKER_02]: much bigger than ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I'm more comfortable getting
my hands dirty, you know, transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, building things and and I do like
to teach as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to find my my niche in the
in the space, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get to tour a lot of really
huge, really nice facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got a great thing going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was likening it to painting and
drawing, you know, when you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: out sketching, you might throw some of
your sketches in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can you can look to somebody
that's a master painter, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody that's got this perfect portrait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it can almost be discouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and the thing that you hear a lot of
times with Instagram, you just see the
[SPEAKER_00]: final beautiful finished product and you
don't necessarily see all the nitty
[SPEAKER_00]: gritty, the problems along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I started working with Nate,
we did a greenhouse and that was my first
[SPEAKER_00]: time growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a totally different
skill set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You I see bugs out there that I've never
seen in my life every time I go out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's beneficial bugs and all kinds of,
you know, insects and things for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had there's a guy, Matt Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a sink angel on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a bug expert cannabis IPM
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have him over and just walk and
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's plenty to find out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing outdoors is every year has been
different for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like a couple of years ago,
we got hit really hard with caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate tomato hornworms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get huge, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't affect cannabis too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do really totally fuck you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years of my life because of tomato
hornworms, especially here in the Bay
[SPEAKER_02]: Area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the thing is, is if you
don't get them early enough, they'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: severe damage and they'll eat on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll you'll end up getting the tritus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get like a secondary infection
because they'll burrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not only they're eating your buds,
but then your plant gets infected and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like looking for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cola breaks off in your hand
and you have all this gray mold on the
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, it can be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it gets a little tough to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't necessarily want to
broadcast that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's those are problems that a lot of
people deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you when you look out and you
just see the, you know, the pretty Finnish
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, you don't necessarily see that most
people have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always the biggest, best looking
bud to go out the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing is just wilted over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of times it's the loudest
plant, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the one that you love the
most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just gets attacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people that have nets for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of preventative things
you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people use BT as a preventative
parasitic wasps or another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a difficult thing to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, you know, you get the
headlamps, you get the headlamp,
[SPEAKER_02]: you go out before the sun rises.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look for the snail trails,
basically looks like you've been to a
[SPEAKER_02]: strip club.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using a UV light, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to come out on a full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the UV light, you can spot either
the damage or the actual caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the strategies, like with the
BT, like when I got hit really hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was when I was spraying the most BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd get these things burrowed into
the center socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can douse these plants as much
as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, couldn't get rid of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're manually picking them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I have a little garden
planted just outside of my greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: where I try to attract some of those
predatory species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll throw a couple of kind of
sacrificial plants out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eat them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just don't get in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed to have helped a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just kind of part of
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many more variables growing
outdoors or in greenhouses than there is
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each season from one year to the next
can be completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a different amount of rain,
a different amount of light, temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: swings.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things can change.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Nate was talking about some
of those plants that I had and they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, about seven and a half feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started getting over my fence
line and catching light from neighbors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, backyard porch lights and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, all these things that I'm able
to control in an indoor setting where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't have light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can I can mess with the temperature and
humidity outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just kind of at the mercy of the
elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smoking really good quality indoor
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every time winter rolls around the
late fall winter with all this good flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love we just had an event not so long
ago, Terp Nami.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw the most amazing collections of
sativas that I'd ever in one place in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, especially maybe in Europe,
you see more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all these amazing flowers,
all these really pungent, pungent flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love smoking the pungent stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it when it burns my nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you don't get that as much
with indoor, especially these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will find some stuff, but like
especially those pungent nose burning,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, loud thials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get the skunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get the a little bit of ammonia I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like those nose burning,
almost chemical smells, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a series up at Swami's place and
you can see that especially for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: location plays a big part in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, up there where the
humidity and temperature is just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the fog rolling in and seems we're
down where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in San Diego and we've had a really
humid couple of last years and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's listening to Swami talk
about all that with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different terpenes that are
produced with natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the lights have gotten a lot
better now, but there is something to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bummer that the market doesn't
always support that because it's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishment to pull down a harvest
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and from one microclimate to the
next, your plant can perform completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't understand that
white thorn rose grown on Johnny's farm at
[SPEAKER_02]: Huckleberry Hill Farms versus Ridgeline,
you can get a different expression of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're close to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one ridge to the next, you can get
different environments and with different
[SPEAKER_02]: results for the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll have, you know, we have a lot of
new states just going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with homegrown, we're shipping seeds
all across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have growers, people that are
brand new to it in places like Maine and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Midwest, maybe a bit north where they
have a short growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always have questions like,
you know, what's what's the best plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: this and that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's I wrote an article about that
kind of explaining it because it's or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of indoor growers,
tent growers, you know, people kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have to make use of the space that they
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the plants can be grown
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you're up north,
you want something with a shorter flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in flowering time, it tends to be
indica or an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and the same thing with some of these
tents and stuff, you might be limited on
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you apply the right techniques like
with training, certain trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, you can you can make it work
with any cultivar that you really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's about finding the right plant
that works for you and then finding out a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to a way to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of right ways and there's a
lot of wrong ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just finding your own path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty of it is like
learning how to grow you back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really needed a mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like most people weren't just like,
oh, I know how to grow cannabis or I just
[SPEAKER_02]: get in my backyard, put it in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get good results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with the technology and the Internet,
if you're really passionate about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can watch podcasts, you can watch
videos on YouTube and really learn how to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it used to be very protected
information kind of locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could go read on the forums or
you could have a buddy teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it used to be, you know, even going to
the hydro stores, you had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been around since before they had
Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was cultivating, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, yeah, you have to find somebody
and show you the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these hydros, you know,
you have to go talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow very tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you said weed or cannabis, they're
kicking you out of the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there used to be feds that would sit
at these hydro stores and follow people,
[SPEAKER_00]: people home and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So literally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they were trying to get store
owners to turn on their fucking customers
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was a really strange world,
you know, and people went to prison for
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I started growing in 2010 or 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we would bring in our our
supplies at night, you know, bringing my
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro tables, all my rock walls that we
would wait till the sun came down and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you're throwing away your your
spent material off site, like finding a
[SPEAKER_00]: dumpster, doing it very secretively
because I had friends getting their doors
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of like I talked to you
earlier, I worked in some dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took back our first
recreational patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of being in it and when it was
full black market to transitioning into
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I am, you know, we're making
videos showing people how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's been quite the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to kind of be along for
the ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, San Diego is a fun place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked in Fallbrook for a little while,
which is San Diego County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the year after I was there,
they had 120 degree day and I heard the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds were they're making seeds in the
field hemp seeds and they were popping
[SPEAKER_02]: like popcorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's got some interesting climate
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm south of downtown San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's across the bay from Coronado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a small bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I've lived my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you go up you go up north where
you have ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you find out with growing cannabis,
you rarely have ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to roll with the punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to MacGyver things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about problem solving and
life is all about problem solving this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a good problem solver,
you can grow good cannabis for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like setting up a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be you have to be good at
doing drywall plumbing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing all these things back in the day
when it was super illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to be an electrician, a carpenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you had to figure stuff out on
your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we MacGyver the shit out of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And not not the safest ways either.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was the only way we knew how to do
it without having help where we could
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like we talked about kind of
finding my my space in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's still my life right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do all that stuff myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a I was growing in my spare room and
I've moved to a 10 by 20 shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've converted that all into a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did insulation drywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did concrete floors and waterproofed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've done videos kind of
renovating that and setting it up for a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is nice getting into
these huge facilities and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything just immaculate like hospital
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the home grower, it's how do I get
this done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I go for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, because even when I'm
fixing a problem, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to put together a piece of
furniture I got, you'll end up YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: again, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll end up looking for somebody like an
instructional video on YouTube showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I I tend to like that more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my my background before I got
into cannabis was in the medical field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would was an x ray tech and a
phlebotomist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would teach students on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it kind of, you know, hiding the
fact that I was growing while I was drug
[SPEAKER_00]: testing people at work and then going home
and harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, being going from instructing
students in the field to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of making instructional videos with
how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it seems to have fallen in line well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you are also I've heard a Jehovah
witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, funny enough, I was more
more afraid about being, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of caught and shunned by the family
than being caught by the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, they the, you know, friends and
family involved in that didn't look too
[SPEAKER_00]: kindly on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you weren't weren't supposed to
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't supposed to have long hair,
no facial hair even.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went in the other direction on that
one a little bit, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, well, and I got my own place
and and started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, family kind of distanced
themselves from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my dad came down with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they was always very,
very against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started making RSO and different
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or different applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's towards towards the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was smoking weed with him and
making medicine for him from my own
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to see it kind of come full circle
and finally have the appreciation for and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to produce your own medicine and
help others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little vindicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The circumstances were a bit sad,
but it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a powerful way to kind of close
that chapter, you know, get some
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's great when your parents can
recognize what you're doing is positive or
[SPEAKER_02]: positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has positive impact in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it took my parents a while to come
to that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they I told them I was growing
when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come home and visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to tell my dad, I got plants in
the garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got plants in the garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I got plants in the garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to let you know I have plants in the
garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is in the 90s,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the 90s, it was much more dangerous,
much more illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but I feel like my parents
are proud of me now and the direction I've
[SPEAKER_02]: gone, especially with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they recognize that it makes
the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stigma for so long, they demonized
cannabis and it was the general thought
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana was bad and dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a reefer madness and then
pushing that agenda for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really we've kind of done a 180 for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more than half of the people in
the United States, especially our pro
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis, recreational,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like it's hard to argue that
cannabis isn't beneficial and people
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't be able to use it as medicine if
they choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I was telling you earlier,
so in the medical field, it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: started in 2007 with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was I don't know if it was the
peak, but it was definitely deep into the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of overprescribing of opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd watch patients totally spiral
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they would, the doctors
would send them home with buckets of pills
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd see these people just take a
nosedive with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they had another option and if it
wasn't stigmatized, some of those people
[SPEAKER_00]: might be alive today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of sad to see, but watching
the industry kind of unfold and the stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of being shed from that is quite
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm happy they're not putting as
many people in prison for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like on a federal level,
we need to change stuff, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's definitely less people going to
prison for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard DeLisi, you know, 32 years on a 98
year sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about him a lot on my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being able to share his story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that he's out now, you know,
and you're working on a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just last week we were out in at MJ
BizCon with 40 times representing Richard
[SPEAKER_00]: DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's got quite the story
and it's people like that that have had to
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrifice that we can all benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tragic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had friends get locked up as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's now we're sitting
across the table, talking about weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking about weed and showing people how
to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're always standing on
the shoulders of giants to get where you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the whole industry is on the
shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at all these breeders,
so-called breeders and seed producers and
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are working with genetics,
we're all on the shoulders of giants and
[SPEAKER_02]: these guys that did it before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was people that did it before
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, these, some of these guys
went and did some stuff that was super
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous and brought this stuff over here
and did some really amazing foundational
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding in the sixties, seventies,
eighties, and even stuff today,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, like I've been,
I think I've been growing for 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was at the tail end of the black
market, but yeah, some of these stories
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear, you're like, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, a lot of the people just
getting into it now aren't ever going to
[SPEAKER_00]: know a time like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like after alcohol prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have short memories too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the people that experienced it,
they may not have experienced it at that
[SPEAKER_02]: level, but people that were never in the
industry when it was really illegal,
[SPEAKER_02]: never understand, you know, their friends
getting murdered or people going to prison
[SPEAKER_02]: for a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about a plant that makes
the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you'd get people driving down from
Humboldt in U-Hauls and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're risking the next couple of decades
of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was, that's when it was
like between 48 and 44 or 48 to 4,500 a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to close down for, about a year
or so after it went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's great that it went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that the access is there,
but as a grower, you know, you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're subject to the market like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to, you have overhead,
you have power bills, you have supplies
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to get.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the price drops out the bottom,
you have to make some tough decisions to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think a lot of us were used
to live in one harvest to the next,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'd almost run out of money by the
time, depending.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was one of those people,
especially early on with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you would almost run out of money
and you'd have to scrape by for a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of weeks till your next harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't, some of my friends went
really big and I was really afraid to go
[SPEAKER_02]: big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, you know, I was one of those guys
with eight lights in the house when some
[SPEAKER_02]: of my friends had 12 houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that I learned from each brother
had, I think like a three or four bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: house with a garage and, you know,
they, they had clones and mothers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sleeping in the kitchen,
every room's blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that was the person that I
learned from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you go through all these
iterations of different styles of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from tried to do living soil my
first run, ended up with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: tables and aeroponics and all these
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a while to sort through some
of those because you research and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: so much information out there can almost
be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of having a mentor, having
somebody guide you and show you what has
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for them and kind of building off
of that and perfecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lesson took me years to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was soil for the longest time and now I
use cocoa, but I also love smoking soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also did soil in my backyard's
house, but we have a sterile facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like as sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really trying to combat pests
fungal pathogens, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start clean, stay clean is our motto.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use rockwool in our nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use cocoa for pheno hunting,
but I do love the way soil tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nice thing about having the
space that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, we'll do a bit of soil,
a bit of rockwool, a bit of cocoa and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of showcase some of these different styles
and help people find what works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my indoor, I've done pretty much
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start in rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll transfer to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can keep my lines clear, I'll run
mineral based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps all those drippers clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can still add my inoculants and
my organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use beneficials and stuff like
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I'll hand water or hand apply
all that so it doesn't get in the lines or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We flushed hand water, but at scale it's
really difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand watering anything at scale is
difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I find that putting beneficials in
that they're going to clog your lines a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't really run them through your
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hand watering our last week we've
in cocoa, we flush and it's all hand water
[SPEAKER_02]: flush once a day and we go pretty heavy,
but that creates an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use kayak cocoa right now, but I've used
Charcor, Kana and gotten great results
[SPEAKER_02]: with both those as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried everything and I like,
I like a bunch of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you settled on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're using United and I'm a big
fan of United and their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the end product really is the best
in my opinion that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've used Athena and I've used cutting
edge and I've used front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to one of their guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good ones out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love John and Sean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have a great product and I
think the flower comes out really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many, Kana is a great
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with Kana on advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Kana for my clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Kana start.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it because before I was using
just United or cutting edge or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically take three EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd cut it down to 1.5 and I just use a
less concentrated dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with that is the micros
like you're getting half the micros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really what you want is more micros.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you want full strength micros with
a lower EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I use that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like there's going to be more
products out like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really like that special product
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like you can walk into the
Hydra store and it gets a little
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk down these aisles and there's
just endless options.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different lines that you maybe
haven't heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'll jump around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get maybe some silicone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get some vodka from one line that's
maybe a bit more affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I try to keep it
simple because there's lines that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: customize every little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me personally, I'd rather work
with a formula and tweak that a bit rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than having all these different variables
that are endlessly changeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 years ago, I used to use 18 different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was also using soil too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I used 18 different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Energy, one of my favorite products
of all time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sea kelp product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we used to use Liquid Karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I used Flora Nova and Botanicare
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I do like simplicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like simplicity and I like being able to
get repeated results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also I have an R&D facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is R&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not growing flour for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're testing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm literally doing phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm growing flour, it's strictly
phenohunting and R&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we test one nutrient line against
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: We test one light against another light.
[SPEAKER_02]: We test under canopy versus light lift
versus the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have to standardize certain
things to cut out the variables that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to test so you can actually see
the results of what you do want to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we usually test one thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we only have one variable that we
change, whether it's soil versus cocoa or
[SPEAKER_02]: the new one is really that little light
lift.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get the Horizon light lift versus
the under canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The canopy versus them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have the control that has
none.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has the standard light at a
standard height.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking for yield potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for cannabinoid improvement,
terpene improvement, all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're comparing terpenes versus
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have COAs where we're running
the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really going to be able to go,
OK, this is better for this reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very scientific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have the right space to get some
dependable results with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason I like R&D for myself is
because I'm a genetics guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can empower my customers and the
people that buy our genetics to get better
[SPEAKER_02]: results, they're going to want to rely on
me in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not going to be just a
transactional relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more of a long term
relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like those kind of relationships a
lot more than, oh, here just buy my seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, yeah, so you bought those
genetics last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look at what I found out about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get better results with under
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can afford the lights, you have the
electricity for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get under canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, we're doing this,
this, and this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to get this type of an
improvement on your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think things like that are what is
going to set companies apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with Homegrown, that's what I try to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to interface with customers as often
as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all kinds of people reaching out for
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always sending me pictures of
their plants with a myriad of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have done it before and
maybe even failed before to identify some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those problems and be able to offer
some type of constructive help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, making mistakes is one of the best
ways to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like some of the smartest people
and the people that are doing it the best
[SPEAKER_02]: have made the most mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned from my mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made tons of mistakes over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivation, everything, business
mistakes, business partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning from my mistakes is one of the
best ways I've learned things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned as much on what to do as what
not to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also learning from other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my friends have made crazy
mistakes where I'm like, oh, I don't ever
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad they made that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just like in any industry,
any field, there's some pitfalls and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some personalities that kind of
are archetypal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll always be there no matter what
aspect you're in, whether it's cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: any other form of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis, it seems like there's enough
space for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be, yeah, this overall
positive and uplifting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it can be a bit of a
minefield, try to navigate some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: interpersonal relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out there in every industry
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ego is out there everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant is supposed to help with the
ego, so one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a grandma RSO and see how your
ego is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll really put your ego in check.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of tunes us in, which is so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should just be this,
I think kind of where the culture started
[SPEAKER_00]: with it is, well, to a degree,
but sharing, communal, uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meeting people like you, it's nice to
see that that sentiment is shared and
[SPEAKER_00]: still alive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had some advice for people
learning, you got any tips or tricks on
[SPEAKER_02]: growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure you get to experience so
many cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's share some tips on cultivation with
the crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me personally, I just kind of,
a lot of times I'll use things I have
[SPEAKER_00]: laying around my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like instead of buying a reservoir,
I pulled an extra trash can back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running that, it's about a 7,500
gallon or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you'll talk to people and
they'll give you a full list of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to get before you even think
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I can tally 5,000 plus
dollars if you look at everything somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: tells you you need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realistically, you can grow with
probably things that you have laying
[SPEAKER_00]: around your house right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these new customers just
getting into the field or getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for the first time, it's easy to
get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's never that- Distracted and
discouraged, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to wait and push it
off to the next season to get started,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not necessarily going to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were saying, failing and building
upon those experiences is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about growing,
and I'll tell people, you don't even need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be consuming cannabis to appreciate the
process of growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that grow roses aren't smoking
them, but they grow them because- Most of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're beautiful to grow and you
can appreciate the flowers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I love about my role with
Homegrown, I get to share seeds with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to give advice to people and
encourage people to get into growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: their very first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love a good white thorn rose,
and I love rosewater turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosewater turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some of my favorite turps,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to say, what's your favorite
turps?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love rosewater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it was to be one flavor profile,
I love so many different things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but rosewater skittles, that's a great
combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get that in the breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've been chasing that for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a long story there, but yeah,
that's something we've been chasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, Tim Humiston and Kyle from Kana
Organics had this rosewater skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a creme rose times skittles,
and it was rosewater turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was from the initial seed
run, and then it changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've been chasing those turps
ever since, and I'm going to find them
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a nice thing about sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a couple of strains down on
my neck of the woods like a bull rider,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't want to give it to
everybody, but you certainly want to share
[SPEAKER_00]: it enough to where if you lose it,
you can possibly get it back from a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see the name around, but that strain
was lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like Blue Dream or something,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've grown it and smelled it and
smoked it, you'll never not be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani bull rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could smell somebody smoking that
10 years later, and you'll know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring you back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like listening to a song you haven't
heard in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bring you back to this moment in
time, and you're like, I know what that
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smelled that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another debatable San Diego,
NorCal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Tom, cat piss Tom, and his cat
piss from San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe there's a different one from
the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one of those unmistakable things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know exactly what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smelled it in years,
and I can't wait till I get to smell it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing with rosewater turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they stick with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They imprint on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I know exactly what that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if you come across a hybrid that
has that mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lamb's bread is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, fucking lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you just start out, there's so many
different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you start kind of experiencing
some of those and smelling them and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking them, you'll surprise yourself at
how you're able to identify some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at new crosses and stuff,
you're like, that smells like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be like, hey, that's quite the
guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually one of its parents.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can look at food like that as
collecting data points over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be a really good breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be a really good chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collect a lot of data points by trying
different things, experiencing different
[SPEAKER_02]: things, and store those in the back of
your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you revisit them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They almost become nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have smells from childhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother was a baker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she had a bakery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she used to bake bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get nostalgic when I smell those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smell certain smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coriander, when people break, they're
baking with coriander.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it brings me back to childhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy canes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do gingerbread houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smell ginger, I have a genetic that
has gingerbread on the nose, like heavy,
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy gingerbread.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tell people, they're like,
oh, my god, it's gingerbread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never smelled gingerbread on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, I've seen it before,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the strongest I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's so responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all these turp profiles that you
wouldn't think a plant will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you smell this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like fried chicken, or exactly
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is so diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different things that
you can go in these different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And green tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go all these savory things to all
these dessert strains, to all these
[SPEAKER_02]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tropical fruits, even, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild when you get into these guavas
and these mangoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder how much is the power of
suggestion versus because some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, they'll tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, this smells exactly like
what you just described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, coming from someone who has
experience with food and with flavor of
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles, there's a lot of that that's
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the power of suggestion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pick up these notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we study terpenes and now
flavorants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Abstract Tech did a bunch of white papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had white papers published.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2024, they talk about flavorants,
sulfur based compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them thiles as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they contribute heavily to the aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's a flavor molecule that's much
smaller than a terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been harder to study.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these guys have taken it outside the
box and really from an outside the box
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, gone in, did scientific
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we can start having these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and all those molecules,
they modulate the high as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you were talking to Anita about
beers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hops is a cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hoppy beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the predominant terpenes in hops is
mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you drink a Corona versus a heavy IPA,
you get a little tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from just the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all that mercine in there that
you're intaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can kind of see that the
mercine that's in a lot of indica strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up getting more of that couch
lock, sedated feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you see how some of these,
and even like limonene, it kind of wakes
[SPEAKER_00]: you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit more vibrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get that present in cannabis,
a lot of times that's in sativas and it
[SPEAKER_00]: has this kind of energizing effect,
kind of wakes you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I wanted to mention too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find that outside in the parking
lot or where did you get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for you at MJBizCon,
but I brought it a bucket of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like sharing strains and stuff,
I've been, there's a few different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been cultivating in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other classes of plants that are
magical, that have unique properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and these are fully legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see them at Home Depot for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The San Pedro cactus is very common in the
East Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the eye for them,
you're able to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of species that at first
glance you might think that are San Pedro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only have five sides, seven sides to
a San Pedro, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like, they can vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can even vary on one column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of like saying, oh,
cannabis has this many lobes on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it can vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did bring some San Pedro,
but this one is a little bit less common.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Peruvian torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Trichocereus burgessii.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they grow really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I brought a few that you can plant in
your garden here and maybe you can share
[SPEAKER_00]: with other people down the road as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We normally don't even let plants in the
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's allowed to bring fresh fruit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you snuck by security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to confiscate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can confiscate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll toss it across the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's great for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally just so people know, yeah,
we don't let any fruits or vegetables that
[SPEAKER_02]: basically are uncooked in the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some stuff in a Tupperware,
whatever, for employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we don't allow... I was looking
for a Tupperware that would fit this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't have any luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some glass jars that might work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely put that at the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cactus and watching cactus grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cacti.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the most beautiful flowers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they tend to grow faster than
any other cactus you'll plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a nice thing to have around.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is a year do they roughly grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little slower growing than
the regular San Pedro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's like, I think anywhere from 12
to 18 inches a year once it's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one I've had growing,
I got them all in my front yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had this one growing for probably 12
years and this one's never flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one flowers a couple of times a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one has about 20% mescaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's legal to grow, legal to own,
but if you process it, it turns into a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pretty flowers and it's nice to grow
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cactus is just amazing to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like growing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super into growing vegetables too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my main focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides cannabis, I love growing tomatoes
and peppers and zucchini and you name it
[SPEAKER_02]: if you can eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love consuming stuff that I grow
especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like one of the things that excites
me the most is to be able to grow a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato, even though I don't eat a lot of
tomatoes and I definitely don't eat them
[SPEAKER_02]: off season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they taste better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste different and even cannabis,
you know, it might not be the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cup winner, but the fact that you
grew it, you put the time and the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes different to smoke your own weed
that you grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love plant medicine in all its forms
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many forms that we are
revisiting now that have been used for
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty wild, you know,
how Western medicine has really like,
[SPEAKER_02]: they basically would like monochemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having this one thing that cures
this one element where a lot of these full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum products like cannabis,
they do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I worked in the medical field,
you'd get medicines like anti-emetics to
[SPEAKER_00]: help with nausea and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always a natural option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can eat ginger instead of
waiting in a waiting room with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: sick people because you're nauseous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people, you know, tend to trust
doctors more and, you know, modern
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is a wonderful thing and there's
lots of advantages to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many problems that you can
fix just with things that you can grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: with things you're able to produce on your
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't always, you know,
just having the ability to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have joint pain or you're suffering
from a number of ailments, cannabis covers
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I think cannabis will cover more
symptoms than just about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't even have to smoke it or eat
it necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it into topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many applications you can use
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able, I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the least amount of side effects,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can talk about stuff that cures
cancer and we can talk about stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: cures all these different things with
heavy side effects with Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you have minimal side effects with
cannabis or with plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends, he's, I grew up with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like my dad's age, but yeah,
came down with cancer and I showed him how
[SPEAKER_00]: to make RSO on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided to take that and monitor
with his doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forwent surgery or chemotherapy and was
able to cure his cancer with, with no
[SPEAKER_00]: surgical intervention, no chemo,
no radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's been cancer-free for
about six years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's with the RSO that I had grown
and showed him how to extract and stuff.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a deep dive into RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to, I would, I think a lot
of, no one's really talked about on the
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've filled over 90 episodes and we
haven't really talked about RSO recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of curious
people that watch this show that would
[SPEAKER_02]: love to hear about making RSO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I, I hadn't produced it prior to
finding out that my dad had come down with
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick Simpson uses denatured alcohol,
which is not, not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's poisonous,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't drink that like an
Everclear or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I opted to.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was making it, I think it was
2014 that I was making that for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to go with, you can either
use Everclear or most recently I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: using a 200 proof food grade ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest doing it outside if you're
able to, but you basically make like a big
[SPEAKER_00]: tea bag that you'll steep in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if I'm telling people how to make
it at home, I'll just use one of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a French press that you would make
coffee in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, I think you, you blend it up and
you can usually get about maybe three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four ounces in a container like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're normally making hash,
you don't want to agitate it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that chlorophyll to bleed
through into your extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with RSO, some of those chlorophylls
and some of those enzymes in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue is exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RSO or whole plant extract,
you know, you're, you're not looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: your top quality buds necessarily,
although you can have those mixed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of times it's the things that
people throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, I mean, you're, you're processing
and extracting things like the stems and
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves and the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to take it a step
further, you can also process the roots in
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's terpenes in the roots as well,
as people know from watching my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's terpenes in the roots that
normally people are not able to interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with because they're, they're not dealing
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not extracting those, but
cannabis, cannabis root.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like an old folklore medicinal
recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if you were going to go that route,
you know, usually you can make it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the by-product that the things that
you would throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I'll soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do two soakings for about,
I'll let the, the material sit with ever
[SPEAKER_00]: like the alcohol for about 15 to 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll strain that off into a pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll soak it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you're left with this like really
rich green looking extracted alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're just reducing it like a
sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to make RSO,
I think in a French press like that with
[SPEAKER_00]: about a quarter pound or so in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'll do is I'll blend it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you powder it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it ends up looking like flour,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you don't, it's not like making water
hash where you, you don't want to break it
[SPEAKER_00]: up too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you'll powder it in a,
like a food processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, you reduce it like a sauce
and making shitty pre-rolls with the food
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from start to finish, I can make a
batch of RSO in about two hours or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people do the longer process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen, you know, just like
anything it's there, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: different techniques out there and it kind
of depends on how much you're scaling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to the dispensary and
it's, it ends up being anywhere from 60 to
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at our Rick Simpson's
recipe and how much he prescribes to take,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up taking about a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start out with a grain of rice and
you ramp it up kind of depending on-
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to hit that target of a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like my tolerance has kind of
dropped out lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even a grain of rice of that is-
When we're talking a thousand milligrams,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just a gram of material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a thousand milligrams of RSO
is much different than a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of other extracts that you
might take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, it doesn't necessarily
translate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's way more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can get a little tough,
especially with people still trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: functional throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've started to do is use CBD
isolate to kind of modulate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will take your dose of RSO and,
and then basically once you start feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects, you'll take your CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's going to kind of let the
THC set in and start doing its thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but allow you to still be functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also competes with those receptors,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of the benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It competes with the receptors so you
don't get this extreme psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It mellows it down a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll actually unseat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like you were saying,
it's, it's kind of like the Narcan of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those, the CBD will actually go in and
unseat that THC that is locked into those
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors and it can actually get you
unhigh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then it's, there are
some- Dabbing CBD is a great way for that
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because I've, I think it's-
Snap you out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are so high that they're
scared to take a dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to take a dab of straight
CBD isolate, you would be feeling pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing right after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I think right now, even a 10
milligram edible is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's done for me for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go right to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start talking about RSO,
there, there are some consumption methods
[SPEAKER_00]: too, that can help to kind of modulate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, when you ingest it,
you know, you activate the liver and it
[SPEAKER_00]: turns into a whole nother compound with
the liver getting involved to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sublingual application, there's even,
I've even seen, so my mom had helped make
[SPEAKER_00]: coconut oil based suppositories and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like when you take it
sublingually, you're absorbing into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mucus membrane, you're bypassing the
liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't affect you quite as
heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the same thing with,
you know, anything other than ingesting it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've even had friends, people that I've
known that, you know, hospice kind of end
[SPEAKER_00]: of life care that have been prescribed
some pretty heavy duty opioids and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's just, it's just basically
to, to knock you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, we've made different
applications for people like that in that
[SPEAKER_00]: boat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's heavy, but it's nice to be
able to help people when they really need
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, cause a lot of people aren't
familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so you would think with weed
being as talked about and as open as it is
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you would, most people would know a
little bit, but you would, you would be so
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised at the amount of people that I
talked to that are coming in completely
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they're, they're, they're in the
same boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same mindset of the last, you know,
doctors, especially doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they, a lot of doctors,
I have friends that are surgeons and they
[SPEAKER_02]: are informed, but I think there's a lot of
people that are uninformed in the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with the system we have, you get
their hands tied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have, when you interface
with insurance companies, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the prescribed line of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there, there are some people that
are aware of it, but they're just not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about it or prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gets a little discouraging and
that's part of the reason that I left it
[SPEAKER_00]: and let my licenses lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that I miss about it,
but there's also a lot that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that it's not going to change
and you can see that people are still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can be involved with an industry and
a company where I'm able to empower people
[SPEAKER_00]: and help educate people and encourage
people to use cannabis as they may.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me something the world doesn't
know about Matt Hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, he's from England,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, half of the reason I come
out to these shoots with him, I bring a
[SPEAKER_00]: tool bag with zip ties and duct tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, before I got into the
medical field, I used to work in theater
[SPEAKER_00]: doing stage management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm used to setting up cameras and
sound and lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like with growing weed,
you end up MacGyvering things and Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: rigging things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's half of the reason I cruise out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's MacGrubering, but yes,
I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come with a zip ties and the duct
tape and we'll make a lot happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's been quite an honor to
work with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to rub elbows with all kinds
of famous people that I see on TV or
[SPEAKER_00]: videos and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll cruise around with this guy and
get to hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been quite the pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got to work with Kyle
Cushman as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started working with him and I
think it was a couple of months into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, I because I,
you know, I'm not like I don't keep up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not abreast with everything,
but I recognize how I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I've seen his Vega Matrix videos from
back in the day, him cruising videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pushing the veganics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've been working with him for I
think about five years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll cruise to all these places and
meet these really great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're huge Cushman fans on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love his podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're doing podcasts because of
people like Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we'll, we'll do these
events and everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, I've had posters of you,
Kyle Cushman on my, on my garage since,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on their ceiling, in their
bedroom, above their beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we'll do these road trips
and set up these interviews and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had him on the show and he
was here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the wings watching.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I love when people are
passionate about cannabis because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate about cannabis and I love that
it's just contagious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you can share that experience
with people, you know, especially people
[SPEAKER_02]: like Kyle, he rubs off on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's like whether it was
his articles in high times and Rosenthal
[SPEAKER_02]: is another one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a character and Kyle is another
character.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, they've helped build this
cannabis world that we all get to
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that about these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Kyle Cushman said the name
Kyle Cushman for 30 years, 34 years as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's got it on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, it's like, these guys
help make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I believe cannabis makes the world a
better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I think the only other time I've been
up to Oakland, we interviewed Ed Rosenthal
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, it's a, yeah, you see these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had their books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed's my crazy uncle, by the way.
Literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed's a character.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and Jane.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen him a few times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I've been liking about
doing, going to MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see all these familiar faces,
catch people in the halls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your favorite event?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you talk about MJ, but as far as
events, you've been able to go to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've gone, we did Alt Pro in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're, they're trying to get a
push through to go legal, but it was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those Delta nine and stuff,
but a lot of great people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we did, uh, what was the event in
Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anacond, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't been to too many,
I think we're, we're scheduled to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Spannabis next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to be included on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, getting out of the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to let Kyle down,
but he's not getting podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can arm wrestle for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not fair for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to have something that's more fair,
you know, like strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we, uh, who knows more names.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a fair one, but now Kyle's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: His podcast is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the whole crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, you know, Matt's, uh,
kind of a one-man band, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy's, uh, running or you should see
him on some of these shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be, he'll be in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: On his stomach, getting these shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got drones in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding them light screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, he puts out some good videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a shotgun in his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to mess with him either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I mean, he'll make me look good
on video sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the beauty of what people
like Matt and Ryan, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're able to make us look better than
we are most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but I feel like the editing,
it's so technical, uh, to do right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's so many, I mean,
people see what they see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see this one finished product,
but there's so many things and so many
[SPEAKER_02]: people that it takes to get there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, not only the stories that
we have that took lifetimes to build that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking about on our show,
but like the editing, the lighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sound, like I didn't realize going in,
it's like, you know, writing a book,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea what it was like to write a
book until I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until I did a podcast, I had no idea
how important light lighting was or sound
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't look at a production the
same once you saw the behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_02]: movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't look at movies the same,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you have more of an
appreciation after you've experienced it
[SPEAKER_02]: from the inside for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I did theater for a few
years, stage management, we would set up
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole point of that is to go
unnoticed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't want them to be aware of
what you're doing because it's part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you, I mean, you, you see us
on screen here and then you look over and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got cameras and lights everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got like the control center with all
the TV monitors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's a lot that goes into it
and it's, it's beyond me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more comfortable, you know,
filling up a pot of dirt and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some plants, but these guys,
that's a, that's a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's just as important as every
other component of the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we're all part of this bigger
picture and making this thing amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I mean, being able to share that with
people because getting out on the farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the mountains and stuff,
you know, people are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not able to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not able to hear their stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got people like Matt and Ryan
running out into those hills, getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting their interviews and being able to
see exactly what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it is encouraging for people
because, you know, you'd be, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be surprised at how many people are
starting out cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know who to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know which route they should
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting this information out,
encouraging people, hearing people's
[SPEAKER_00]: stories, hearing people like Rick DeLisi
and what he went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are important stories that need to
be told.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, what would that one piece
[SPEAKER_02]: be?
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the pre Jehovah witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got out of that as soon as I
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being tied to the status quo,
you know, like I, you get into a career
[SPEAKER_00]: and the path of life rarely leaves you at
that same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really easy to get tied in and
sentimental to where you are at that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular moment, maybe walking away from
a job and mourning it and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what's going to happen next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for everybody, you'll hear this time
and time again, it ends up falling into
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's something that you're
passionate about, something that you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you pursue that with enough time,
you get all these pieces that all these
[SPEAKER_00]: dominoes that fall and, and you'll find
yourself sitting across the table from
[SPEAKER_00]: James Loud, giving an interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole experience we call life is
pretty wild and pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many blessings to be had
just across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people want to know more about
Parker Curtis and Homegrown, where can
[SPEAKER_02]: they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my Instagram is Parker Curtis 420 and
our website with Homegrown Cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrowncannabis.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find all of his, all of our
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're showing people how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving advice on what kind of seeds
are best for your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at this point, our company
Instagram was taken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nate Hammer 420 is where he posts a lot
of our content as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite thing to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I used to dab it up all the,
all the time, but now it's, it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was blunts, but I like putting flame to
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do the vapes or the dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: DMT, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that a couple of times the last time
it scared the shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go down a rabbit hole that you
don't want to go back to for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like that movie Stargate where you
just like a step through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still enjoy that, but yeah, we'll try
this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, you can plant this and probably
in five to seven years, you'll have some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some big pieces to cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on the
podcast.
