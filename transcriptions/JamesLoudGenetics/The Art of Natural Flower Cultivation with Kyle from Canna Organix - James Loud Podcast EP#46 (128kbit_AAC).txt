[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Lab Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, our special guest is Kyle from Kana
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Kyle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, thank you so much for coming on,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while we've been talking about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I have worked together for,
I don't know, five years or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, doing the breeding, doing all kinds
of fun stuff, seed production for other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you work with Tim up at Kana Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good people, Tim, Wendy, all these great
people up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Steve, everybody at Kana
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so tell us how you got started in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rec industry or just the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started, I mean, obviously you're
smoking when you're younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, smoking when I was a kid,
like most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: 12th, sixth grade, started puffing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to high school in South Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I started smoking weed
and hustling and shit like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good weed back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tacoma being so close to the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was mainly what we ran through in
high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good weed would come through,
but it was real rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't a lot of people growing
like in your circle of friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of people getting
Canadian weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Canadian weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd go in three stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd get 1A, 2A, or 3A.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always want the shit that said 3A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember the strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like red with some crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you'd get some shit that was
like a little light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they like football size pounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, football size pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they'd say like good year on the
side of them and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess let's dive in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in Covillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You worked down there for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started growing weed when I was 19.
[SPEAKER_03]: I rented a house in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blew up the upstairs and would sleep
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when I was like 19.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first strains were we had a purple NL,
NL number four, a skunk, a jack,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to Canada and I bought a
bunch of mango seeds, Canadian mango,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey Jones, that shit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard that in forever.
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was like 2002 or 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go to Linda's.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like the local lady down the
street and she made some A and B,
[SPEAKER_03]: an organic A and B.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd mix banana, manna, and cool bloom.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the recipe back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do for substrate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil and then you'd get black gold?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we'd mix happy frog and ocean forest
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd put them in five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the ocean forest is so hot that
you want to take it down a notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because ocean forest is so thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: The happy frog is so much lighter than
medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ocean forest, they said more
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how true that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a hot mix at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a big fan of ocean forest back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely thicker than I like though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But creates a good product at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know it's all in how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the substrate, the
nutrients, the way you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all of that combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making sure that you're precise in
hitting all those requirements when you
[SPEAKER_03]: need to on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good genetics definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, back in the day, the genetics
weren't, you think they were that great or
[SPEAKER_03]: you think the growers were fucking
outstanding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it was both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had really good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was diverse like it is
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that they were really good
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really passionate people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't growing a hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was normal for people to grow six
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still do that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of this stuff came out
of closets and bedrooms and garages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way more than now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day when everyone talks about
how great the weed was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking how close to the grower
people probably were and didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like the texture of the herb when
you would get a real bomb bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like all velvety or had like a
tarantula look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tarantula hair sort of look, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you think about it, like us as
growers know that when you cut it and hang
[SPEAKER_03]: it and put it on the stick, it looks
fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once people put their fucking
hands on it and start trimming it and it
[SPEAKER_03]: goes in the turkey and shit, it totally
loses that like beautiful flower look.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the herb back in the day,
if you think about it, it was probably
[SPEAKER_03]: coming from one to two people who were
cutting it off the stick and throwing it
[SPEAKER_03]: in a fucking bag for you to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like the freshness of that I think
is what we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmed to table model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all like experiencing where it was
like this is so bomb and you know compared
[SPEAKER_03]: to you know the Canadian or the Mexican
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff got smashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smashed and just sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I think the genetics back in the
day were good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was different than today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everything was a lot more
distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hundred different gelato
derivatives right now that are popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like we probably had, you know,
we had purple kush that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gelato, but like that was kind of
what we had back in the day that was
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: What year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 98, 99, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a GDP, but there wasn't five
GDPs or 10 OGs really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I guess OGs kind of picked up and
we got more OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was probably 10 OGs,
but a lot of them were the same exact cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just renamed something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have like derivatives of
derivatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the name of that OG was?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the original OG I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real OG like where Josh D or Mad Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mad Dog.
RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those and same thing Ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headband that we had up here was that
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are just four of the many names
of the same exact cut where it went to
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like a different model back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to share your genetics
with anybody because the second it got
[SPEAKER_00]: out, it would take away the value of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more rare if you held onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that OG gas was pretty epic back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost a lot of friends not giving out
cuts honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, you know, like there's
nothing worse too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone's like, can I get a cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't share genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't share genetics that much either,
but then you and your partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've shared a lot of genetics because I
trust you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't give them out to people
typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys don't give them out to people,
but we've shared a lot of stuff over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years and you guys grow really good
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a handful of people out there
that I've shared genetics with on the
[SPEAKER_00]: level that I've shared good stuff with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have shared a lot of good stuff
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it definitely helps for when we're
chucking pollen and shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making seeds and making new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys love phenohunting just as
much as I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, we've been in
dozens of gardens where we get our noses
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty and I love that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I love being able to smell 10
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's say you have 10 different seeds
and each one has its own different
[SPEAKER_00]: personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are all good for
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if you grow well enough,
they take on their own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the thing is like you have to be
able to grow at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't grow at that level,
there's almost no point in really
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting because your stuff all comes
out almost identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much variety, like you're
saying too, especially when you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: getting into like, you know, 50,
50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I do more than 50 seeds, I feel like
too many fall through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to like doing big phenohunts where
you have like 300, but you lose stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a different phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a, you're doing variety testing
on a different level where you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at stuff that's similar and you're trying
to find unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the guys that are unicorn hunting,
short gene finder, you know, when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing their big 20,000 seed
phenohunts at Harborside and he's done
[SPEAKER_00]: some really incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a different model than what I
like is to, you know, cause I also think
[SPEAKER_00]: you should grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can grow them out multiple
times to really find your selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it and hit it right the first
time, but sometimes it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after your third round of it,
it could be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that with the Pluto S1s,
those Pluto S1 seeds, going through those,
[SPEAKER_00]: it went from, you know, where it was one
way, one time it was more candy and more
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato 33 that all of a sudden it turned
into more lemon citrus with that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: OG gas coming off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like hunting bag seeds too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, when, when I always just ran
clones and then once we started making
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, I wanted to go through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was never really that big on popping
other people's gear or bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I just wanted to have whatever was
going to sell the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ran clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your philosophy on breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in phenohunting, what are you looking
for nowadays?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for when you go
through a room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now I just want whatever is like a,
different from the parents that I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm crossing them to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, like you're saying, I run a lot
of different, uh, gelato crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm usually going for whatever the
grandparents are going to bring out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of what I look, whatever's not
like gelato that I'm going to get some
[SPEAKER_03]: gelato structure and crystal from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so let's take, for example,
so we've done a collaboration project
[SPEAKER_00]: that's available on the website,
which is the Loud Cannogenics
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that we have the Glulato seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done some awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glulato is in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with rain shadow runs,
badass cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going through those,
what would you say that you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, if you have a checklist,
what's at the top of the checklist on
[SPEAKER_00]: Glulato?
[SPEAKER_03]: All those gelato seeds, you know,
we, we did multiple 30,000 seed
[SPEAKER_03]: phenohunts, you know, sniffing,
sniffing weed till our noses were like
[SPEAKER_03]: literally raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I like, I got to have like a
smaller after, you know, we did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like learned this lesson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can't smell weed for like two
days straight like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was like abusive to my
nostrils coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't do shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does for a little while, but adaptation
occurs and then everything starts smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: the same where your nostrils get burned
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, burnt, burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hurts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I was saying like the 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through 50, 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't mind doing, I don't want
50 of more than 50 of one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't mind having multiple things
and going through multiple, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's, it's really dependent on,
if you know the genetic as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: like your cross, if you, if you know kind
of what you're going to get and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for, you start to learn
whether you need to pop 50 or you can pop
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to get something that you're kind of
looking for with the blue dream S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's not that many different
expressions of blue dream when you make
[SPEAKER_00]: the S ones, whereas something like gelato
33, every single one of them is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And half of them hurt, but, but,
you know, it's like, so the more,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your lines, it seems like the
easier it is to figure out how many you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's a personal thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to pop 300 and they want
to do them outside and that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as your favorite thing right now to
smoke, what's your favorite thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: The offender cross, the GMO gelato cross I
made a couple of years ago right now is my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loud and it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's called the Fendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has the gelato undertones,
but it's got that GMO, Chem D kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: overtone initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the gelato that kind of
hits you in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the gelato gas, no, no sweet to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no sweet to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little musky little, it's got a
little bit of that gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what I want right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that's just like incredibly loud
and offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can smoke it down to the roach
and it still tastes good when you refire
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bet it washes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It washes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I still like rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love smoking that, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us about rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the years, it's starting to drift to
like some other candy strands we were kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's getting gassier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting gassier and less candy,
less candy, but it was really initially
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a Skittles gelato 41 and it's
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have won awards with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It crushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you guys, I remember when you
guys were first testing it and going
[SPEAKER_00]: through, I checked out the Finos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You helped me pick that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so candy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has better structure than Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has an improved structure,
but yet it carries the Skittles turps and
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is really attached to that
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want, if you cross nine out of
10 things with Skittles, you're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want Skittles, you're going to have
to get stuff that has the shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just how it goes with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want, you know, if you're okay
with the different structure, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be okay with different turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seattle, the landscape has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do everything up there besides
have a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys do extract and you guys do a
greenhouse and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started that in 2014, me, Tim,
Wendy and Steve, my, my core friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: we all been partners for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys came from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all came from Tacoma and then we all
did a tour down in Cali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and Steve did nine years and I think
Tim and Wendy did six.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we learned how to grow big outdoor
plants and growing greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, when, when you're growing in
California, you don't get the numbers like
[SPEAKER_03]: we do commercially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tried to get as much weed as we
could just off, you know, what we were
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed in Mendocino was 25.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd try to get those 25 crushing big
ass monster plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd get like 10 to 12 pound average on
blue dreams and lemon Larry's and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of what we, we like to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim really loved blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Larry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dream is an easy one to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about that on the show quite
often, actually, how easy it is to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to get the stock rod on big ass
blue dreams too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you top them, you won't,
you don't have to worry about bud rot or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, but it can get huge
massive colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes, you know, whatever you feed it,
it'll take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really push blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to do a cross with it soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green crack and the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from the Hayes brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the green crack too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tino's genetics has green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does some interesting stuff with green
crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked green crack back in the day,
but it was like one of those ones where
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd smoke it and you'd get a tolerance
to it and boom, you can't smoke any more
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it doesn't get you high at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was some work for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it gets you the yield you wanted,
especially if you only had 25 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: People laugh at 25 plants now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you get 200 pounds, who gives a
fuck?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the prices were high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different world now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what year did you guys move to
Washington from California to do Kano
[SPEAKER_00]: organics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they started Kano organics,
uh, two years before me doing the build
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a hundred percent mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started with nothing and then they just
started building it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was kind of saying, like,
we're only allowed to do 25 big plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we started Kano organics,
we were running 65 gallon plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her 50 by 25 in greenhouse space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, we had longer veg
time, you know, more clean out,
[SPEAKER_03]: more Scrog, you know, all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we learned how to grow weed,
it was in Mendocino doing big plants
[SPEAKER_03]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we started Kana in Washington,
we just kind of transferred that same sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of style over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went greenhouse though, when you went
to Kana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys also have the coolest little,
you know, so like it's a, it's a half
[SPEAKER_00]: depth, like half height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to really describe
it, but it's a, you guys do, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: that in May, you're at your outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We start our outdoor in May and then we
pull it down by the beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like three months, three month
little window.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just for extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can make, you know, sauce and tossed
and different sort of like joints and
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you do some cool stuff up there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys have like a greenhouse,
you have a greenhouse with a, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: heat layer too that traps the heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two different greenhouses that my
partner Tim has designed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first ones we did were just,
they're a little rough, but they work
[SPEAKER_03]: great.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's totally done some like amazing stuff
when it comes to how he designed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got like heat that runs through the
floor and he's designed all our
[SPEAKER_03]: controllers and our old greenhouses even
have like heat exchangers in them,
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial size heat exchangers that take
out the old hot air, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we can control the humidity and fresh
air that comes back in is tempered so we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to pay for higher propane bills
and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks super clean, super efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim's always efficient with his designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's smart, creative and always thinking
outside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try to improve stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you're trying to improve flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tries to improve the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He builds the systems and then I break
them and tell them to fix the shit and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we fix it and it's, it's a fun
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we just, we're always trying to,
he's always trying to innovate some
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the extract tip, you guys have some of
the best tasting pens I've ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the new stuff is really incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was never a pen guy before them,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never a forbidden fruit guy and then
you gave me some forbidden fruit to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, impressive turps, long finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big tangy fan for say with pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not because it doesn't get you
high though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say mostly, I mean, I like the
turps, but like as far as like it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but when you mix it with like 80%
fucking THCA, that shit is fucking strong
[SPEAKER_03]: and bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird how much better I was going to
say it's like really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll have like a high terpene extract
mixed with distillate and I personally,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will never taste like the flower does,
you know, but then you mix the terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: with just the THCA and it's like,
I'm taking the best fucking dab of my life
[SPEAKER_03]: every single time I hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're getting a concentrated
version of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Concentrated version.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time you hit the pen,
it's at the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the times when we dab,
you know, you heat it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's somewhat of a guessing game
or you have a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your hand next to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you guys grow really good flower
up there in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one thing that
separates you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus your list of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a pretty long list of good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, when we first moved up
there, we're only allowed to like really
[SPEAKER_03]: have so, so many plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after we brought those plants into the
system, it was kind of like, we had to
[SPEAKER_03]: mimic what California was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: California had, you know, at that point
and it was like 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you needed to have like every strain to
like really sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, it's not really like that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of leveled out to
where people kind of just like what they
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that time, you know, if you wanted
to sell, you needed wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you needed Gorilla Glue number
four, you know, that shit was hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed some candy land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then once, you know, the strains,
we had all died off.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still needed to have new shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just started making our own stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, as they say, like from need comes
necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of what started all that
sort of breeding, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really, it's really a lot easier,
honestly, to do your selections outside
[SPEAKER_03]: than it is inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was easier for us to do and we were
making everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do both though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do selections outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen some.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know, I personally like,
um, like it inside, but it was easier
[SPEAKER_03]: outside kind of like when I'm space wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Space wise and growing under the sun seeds
is like super fucking sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you're selecting,
there's something about, uh, the high
[SPEAKER_03]: intensity lights cause more herm problems
when I grow outside and I'm doing my
[SPEAKER_03]: selectings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, you know, most of the time I
don't have any problems at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take the same strains and go inside
and the stress from the lights or the feed
[SPEAKER_03]: or something usually will trigger a little
bit more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a problem with that string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get rid of the seed run completely and
just go from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's my way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, and everyone has their own
opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like that initial seed run,
especially if you're selling seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: acres, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're selecting for
genetics that you want to sell clones of
[SPEAKER_00]: starting from that first clonal generation
is key because then you kind of see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you get and growing it out again before
you really start picking which ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes I like getting rid of
50% of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just not good right off the bat,
but you know, I honestly, I totally hear
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but sometimes when you find a
winner, you find a winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to run it twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, this is fucking money.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're growing it too, you're,
you're watching it and you're like looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the one you go back to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like every, all your other
growers are all looking at the same one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a mystery on what's going to win
this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but you want to make sure by growing
it again to make sure that you hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of times, you know,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, but that second time
confirmed because I've had stuff where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like, that's the one a hundred
percent Pluto.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were looking through Pluto
backseat, the ones we thought were the
[SPEAKER_00]: winners on the first round were not the
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were not in a fucking completely
changed, uh, as that's plant matured.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was weird though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you think that's cause it was a bag
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, there's just a lot of genetic
diversity in there besides, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: being the bags bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides that, that cross has a lot of
genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different expressions
you get in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of bad ones to find the good
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the winners were found out of
probably 500 seeds or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other people have popped and
found some winners too out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold seeds, sticky farms,
gas house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys sold seeds of that cross and
there's there's some winners of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from, uh, up there too,
by Kovalo sticky farms, sticky farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky farms, the Pluto guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work with gas house and does their
collaboration with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pluto is good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got unique, especially because it
has a gelato 33 with something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I got an ice cream cake times
Cushman's cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking bomb, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wedding cake crosses are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the breadiness of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a sweet one too though.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like two cakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 30 cakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I only know, I only know of two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know one that was like super sweet where
you hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, damn, this is a cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a doughy one,
which is the one I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, I had the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar has the gassy one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, so see junkie sold seeds of
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of expressions that
popped up from people all over and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all calling it wedding cake and
they're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like a couple of good ones,
a couple of really good ones, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gassy and Brady, those are the two,
you know, there was the one that yielded
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just wasn't that therapy that was
going around California quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, still really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think good breeder, good cook,
you know, as far as bag of peel,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like, I like cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed the gelato to that across the
gelato to everything, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 41.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 41 is pretty special time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference with the 41 and the 33,
we're kind of talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the 33 has a lot more genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the 41 I think is more stable and
for breeding, if you're breeding at scale
[SPEAKER_00]: or breeding to put stuff out in fields,
41 is your ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you maybe don't, you don't get the
color yet from the 33.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but, uh, but it will send it two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can get way gas in your
selections or you can get way sweet,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, which add near.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about mochi?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just some more gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is a gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like 41 best by far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, when we were first
running it, it was a lot sweeter than it
[SPEAKER_03]: is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's been, been around for like
eight years now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's definitely way gassier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the champagne cut, the pink
champagne, the bud structure that pink
[SPEAKER_03]: champagne reminds me a lot of these creme
Rosé crosses that I was making it work for
[SPEAKER_03]: a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So creme Rosé is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you gave him, you gave it to me,
but you also lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was the, it was the Skittles
times creme Rosé.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have those seeds, but I made the
Skittles creme Rosé times wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a new one out that it's called
cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's from the creme Rosé line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did so much work with that for like two
years and it was all just trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the structure was trash,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But the terps were so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Rosewater is really like a
terp that I'm like going for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all in on that, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the fucking LaCroix.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the LaCroix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Rosewater terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my humble opinion, if you can capture
Rosewater with Skittles, where it's candy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosewater, that's a fucking winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extract is a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pop a bunch of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a ton of them because I crossed that
creme Rosé Skittles to a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had that times the do-si-do,
the wedding cake, the gelato, back cross
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did work with it, but the male we
used on the creme Rosé was dominant in
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just fucking hated it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like too small and never had the
crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crystal that I like really was going
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a back appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be more of a washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this new one called White Thorn
Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's newer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not new new, but it's been around for
a while, but it's been winning awards and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes purple hash, purple rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty, pretty sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on that Rosewater terp level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, mild.
[SPEAKER_03]: LaCroix.
[SPEAKER_00]: LaCroix.
[SPEAKER_03]: LaCroix, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to say it like that with the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do it with the hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever grow big outdoor before?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some big outdoor plants,
like with my partner Micah, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: me as much as it was my partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my backyard, I did some big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did more smaller ones for seed
production and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do like not big, big monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine were mostly like, they would be like
five foot tall plants or six foot tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: really wide, you know, and then we did
seeds with those and I would, that's how I
[SPEAKER_00]: get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In pots, in beds and in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always liked experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what, in the ground,
I feel like in the ground is the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for my opinion, pots are okay too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the same time, if you're doing
seed production and you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: move that plant around, you know,
it's like, once you know your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your area where you're going, but mine
was, you know, it wasn't commercial like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, you know, homegrown back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are so gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that do 400 gallons in smart
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a couple of eight hundreds too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're getting a 12 pound plant
off that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had 12 to 15 pounds on those ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd always put them in like the best spot
of the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when I was loud seeds, my partner
used to crush it, big plants, sour diesels
[SPEAKER_00]: that were just monsters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to that cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: That cut went away with the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hoplatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, I've seen some sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last year that's been sour,
but still not that punch you in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour that where you open the bag and
you're like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still waiting to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about great babe for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people sometimes talk about GDP and
great babe being related and they might
[SPEAKER_00]: be, but they're totally two different
plants because great babe would yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get huge purple buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get that from your GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not get that from GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDP that we had was a shorter plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got really tight buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My GDPs, uh, the ones that I was messing
with back in the day, the GDP was always
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest with the least amount of Terps
of the three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it went great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bape was like medium sized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Urkel was the third in the Urkel
was the shortest, smallest, hardest to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, but just oozed fucking Terps,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the GDP indoors and it was like
a 31 day veg, 28 to 31 days, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that where you'd veg them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you didn't veg them tall enough,
you wouldn't get enough big buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What size pot were you using for that long
veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so we grew them in octagons for a
while where we had five gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was vertical growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we grew them in, in beds with,
you know, mostly what we did back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day was five gallons, sometimes 10
gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your medium in a five gallon pot
in an octagon?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the octagon, we use soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use soil in the octagons back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you supposed to use hydrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not in the octagon that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Dutch pots though.
[SPEAKER_00]: These square pots that have a hole in the
back and they fit into the octagon shelves
[SPEAKER_00]: to where you can fit 26 plants per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all, you get small buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one time we did the chem dog and I
grew a wall of larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally I had a wall of larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it was beautiful,
but it wasn't like stuff you could really
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I grew chem dog in an octagon where
you need, cause it doubles in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not the right genetic to grow in
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that either you flip it
right away cause you want smaller cause
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your lights probably, I think 28
inches away from the star.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just one bulb straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: One bulb in a cool tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a cool tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool tube is way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 24 years ago or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were doing all kinds of amazing
genetics in them, but, uh, the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: would double in flower and the more sativa
stuff was not good for octagons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were worried about the carbon
footprint in the sense of helicopters,
[SPEAKER_00]: going over an infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, Oh yeah, we grow in
octagons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to find our girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I had four octagons in my garage
at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did that cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: To build four octagons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had the frame we built ourselves
from plywood and two by fours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, we framed ourselves because
there used to be a whole octagon
[SPEAKER_03]: contraption that they wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we never bought that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend came down hippie style,
but he had like this paper where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: all sketched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the angles were set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had all this stuff pre-cut where
we'd cut it all and then snap it all
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a 500 gallon reservoir that was on a
table that we thought we could just
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we started out trying to do the
gravity feed, but it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to get a pump, but we got a hole
in the reservoir and this was always
[SPEAKER_00]: always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a homemade reservoir where we
had one of those pool liners that we built
[SPEAKER_03]: a box on top of a table, but, uh,
I had to do whatever you had to do back
[SPEAKER_03]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did whatever we had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause who else is going to do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I still love the smell of fucking wet dirt
in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you go to the, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, there's something wrong about
pro mix next to carpet where you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, yeah, seriously reminds me of my
youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garage grows, but some of the best
weed has been grown in garages.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow some of the best weed I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say your secret to success
is growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never takes a break.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hear people say that,
like the devotion that it takes to like
[SPEAKER_03]: really nail everything on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it doesn't care about Christmas
or kids' birthdays or any of that other
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might need to get watered at 2 AM and
you got to go get that shit done in their
[SPEAKER_03]: slippers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just like a level of care to
grow great cannabis that, uh, is really
[SPEAKER_03]: hard to achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people do it and hats off to
them, you know, but it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I grow in greenhouses for work
and that in itself is truly the hardest
[SPEAKER_03]: grow ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to grow, to grow in Washington
in greenhouses, in beds and to crop steer
[SPEAKER_03]: that is maddening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we live in a spot that's like
called the banana belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's Washington and it doesn't rain a
lot, but the sun comes out and every two
[SPEAKER_03]: hours or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might be set up to water two or
three times for the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then the sun goes away and now it's
cloudy forever and I can't do these extra
[SPEAKER_03]: waterings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just like learning to do that in a
bed is completely different than learning
[SPEAKER_03]: how to do that in a pot that you can pick
up and feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the level of care that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes to grow great cannabis,
especially in Washington, especially in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of maddening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a great team and I'm,
I'm proud of the guys I got that right
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, my whole business is how big
is your team?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got like seven, seven guys outside
to run almost 30,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got like 47 or 48 employees at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it can organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make a lot of vapes and we make,
uh, we sell a lot of joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of seems to be where the
market is, is headed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were talking about these,
these vapes that we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like I was saying, I don't,
I don't really ever smoke vapes until I
[SPEAKER_03]: got these vapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just cause it's the vape that I'm
trying to push.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to push my vape, but at the
same time, like it's a vape that's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually enjoyable all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the turps don't burn out too
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: They last a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you can smoke the vape.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like anywhere I fucking hit it
before I went and got my rental car on the
[SPEAKER_03]: way down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like they're so convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're at safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: People love convenience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other day I was at safeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a hit and then stuck my head inside
the cereal box aisle and blew it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like they're a little dangerous,
you know, in that sense too, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're smoking straight THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like flock faded when some of
them don't even smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts smelling like other things like
candy, forbidden fruit smells like orange
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the vapes I noticed it tastes a lot
sweeter than it does in flower form.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I smoke the vapes, it's like a bright
sort of orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the loudest carts I've smoked
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they, you get big hits out of those
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get big hits and it doesn't burn them
too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where you lose the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of these like really
like fancy vapes that are out there kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more of a gimmicky looking than
they are like burning well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of gimmicky stuff out there
still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're, we're trying to evolve
into new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be gimmicky stuff
along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody does it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then someone does it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the new popular stuff,
what are you going for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you talked about you,
you like offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The work that I was doing before,
I don't know if I'd really call it like
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding as much as I'd call it just like
exploring and Paul and Chuck and
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, because I was just kind of
trying to do what like either was like
[SPEAKER_03]: popular at the time or what other people
were doing, you know, in the sense where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're telling me they want me to make
this, you know, the stuff that I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do in the future, like the stuff I have
going right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, just trying to do weird things,
like whole bunch of different sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to dust with Skittles and I got
my rain shadow and then I got my offendo
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, which is funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've got this golden ticket,
uh, times gelato cross too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called lemon winks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to name it lemon farts,
but my, my homie Steve was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: nah, bro, I ain't selling weed called
lemon farts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still like that name.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's turds and lemony,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Turd cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm not the
salesman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so like if I, the way I think about it
is like up until now, I've just been
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing like candy with some popular
things, but all these old sativas,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the derb, the headband, the,
uh, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this old, old school haze,
a grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these like kind of weird things that
phased out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like before, you know, it was kind of
like, I wanted like genetics that were
[SPEAKER_03]: popular and, and now I kind of just want
weird things to come from it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: where I'm not worried about like filling a
field or having a hot new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to like have more fun with
breeding and seeing the weird shit that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to come out of the crosses that
really no one's really doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the popular shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, like the skittles turd,
you know, to like a real lemony haze could
[SPEAKER_03]: be super bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just really haven't heard of,
you know, anyone doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if people are, I mean,
but I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, like I'm saying,
it sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even like, you know, taking like the
funk of the offendo and then crossing that
[SPEAKER_03]: to different sorts of like sativas and
then seeing the weird shit that comes from
[SPEAKER_03]: that because anything that's got GMO and
it's going to be weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funk funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the underlying funk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, you know,
I want to make a lot of S ones of those
[SPEAKER_03]: two and then the gear that I already have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want to explore that some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where I see myself in
the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of took a couple of years off.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a little maddening and now I'm
ready to get back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to do it in phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's the best way to get
excited and inspired and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some fucking really interesting
stuff up there that you guys have done to
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, grape high chew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were doing that for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had some jokers running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're crushing the jokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice and gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked the Tokyo snow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one doesn't ever really get much
height, but it's definitely funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got that cut from first-class genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a different term.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to do some work with that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's play a game real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to name a strain and then you're
going to name a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to keep going back and
forth until one of us doesn't name any
[SPEAKER_00]: more strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, a lot of genetics
and, uh, so I'm going to start with super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start with old ones first and
then work my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go old old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go even older.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're older than me though.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Limers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Columbia gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jogu.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's newer, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afgu.
[SPEAKER_03]: You went from Jogu to Afgu?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Larry said blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the tip of my tongue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity the strain from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Eugene Oregon Trinity super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's, it's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadhead OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Larry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Larry OG kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diabolo OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Presidential OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super silver goo.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemon drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, you said lemon drops on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some lemon drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to that fucking cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but the juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The juicy fruit was fire too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, that was a Canadian one,
but also we had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that lemon drop was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like straight lemon heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like eating lemon head candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got powdery so bad outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why it fucking disappeared
was cause it had so many problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why a lot of genetics went away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the next one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Triple platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever fucking fuck with that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: The triple platinum?
[SPEAKER_03]: It took like 12 weeks, gave you no weed,
but was the most gassy OG ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the platinum OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think it was a Bubba S1,
but it was a huge OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the OG structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't quite as loud, but man,
it had the structure, the smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag appeal, everything, but the smoke
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think quite as good as like the Josh D
or the real OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got my lemon Larry cut,
I drove down to LA and I were playing a
[SPEAKER_03]: game, but I got to tell this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got my lemon Larry cut,
I drove down to LA cause my buddy was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, go pick up this fire for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got 50 lemon Larrys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other one was this triple platinum
kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was telling you and that shit
yielded nothing was so hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to fight PM, but it was to this
day, some of the pest tasting OG I ever
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just such a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I let it die cause I was young
and dumb, but man, if there's anyone out
[SPEAKER_03]: there who's got the triple platinum OG and
they see this, throw that shit my way,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a triple X OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A triple X OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Johnny at triple X genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Johnny from LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Master Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Adam Dunn, MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got my Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, ooh, we'll do Big Sur Holy Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lowest, the weakest of all weed did
not get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the one we had, it looked amazing,
smelled amazing, tasted amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: did not get you high, but it really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been bred into all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looked great though, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first round was Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing is, is maybe you didn't have
the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with LA Confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing if you had the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real LA Con was fucking special.
[SPEAKER_03]: SF OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: SF OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma OG.
Headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a great one too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dragon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo Perps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fort Collins Koff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Piff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Cuban Black Haze S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a name that people just call haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a real one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some flower at the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Piff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matanewska Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: ATF.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MTF.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's the ATF as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights number three, four,
five, and seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only knew about the four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you only knew about the four,
the seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about the seven made the
cat piss that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Old Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Super Skunk.
GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO Chem D.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Sis.
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's just so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could probably go for another hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names and nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the Orange Crush back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there were so many oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oranges, across the board,
you had Orange Blossom and Orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Orange Blossom, Orange Juice,
Orange Run.
Do they sell in Cali?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, Orange?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hot right now in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oranges?
[SPEAKER_03]: People like oranges and lemons.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like everything old again right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in Cali.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Washington right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seeing this huge shift of people
just wanting to smoke some old shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the amount of names that are on
the checkered board, as far as strains go,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how fast they come and go,
people don't know what to fucking get
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, let me get this shit
that I was getting three years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought it before and liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, California, I think, totally
different market in some ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, California leads the market in my
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads a lot of things in the market,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington's way more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they trust brands a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you guys are a trustworthy
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a handful of other trustworthy
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: House Cultivar, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a wide variety of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the beauties of
Washington, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about diversity in genetics and
stuff to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have 40 different things that go
on the menu at any given time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely have a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to narrow a lot of that down
right now, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to stay away from candy so much
because it's just all we've been growing
[SPEAKER_03]: for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market shifted to wanting different
things, older things, and I'm ready to
[SPEAKER_03]: shift with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just start growing a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of sativas, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was saying, when people go to the
store, they want something they know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they might not even know the name of
any of this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do they say?
[SPEAKER_03]: They say, can I have an indica or can I
have a sativa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, well, they don't want to sound
stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want something that they think is
going to fuck them up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives them that effect that they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many names now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many names.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so hard to find a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so awful at like naming shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's time to like come up with a
name, I just want to hit my head against a
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because they're all taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think honestly, I just kind of
want to steer towards funny names from now
[SPEAKER_03]: on because every candy is taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every ice cream is taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's good that you want to put
in your fucking mouth, it's taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now you just got to start making
words up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, a WhatsApp or some shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could have like a slogan for every
strain that you come up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the name game is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain formerly known as Prince.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start using symbols.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've thought of that one before,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's wild because there's thousands
and thousands and thousands of different
[SPEAKER_00]: names already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are people people are
using and then people stepping on each
[SPEAKER_00]: other's toes and people getting offended
over taking the names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only that, but like some some
names have like been taken by people who
[SPEAKER_03]: don't breed or grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got some weed in in bulk and gave it
a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Leafley's like so and so in
Colorado says this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Rain Shadow Runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How guys name because originally it was
Rainbow Runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Rainbow Runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mike literally came out around
the same time with Rainbow Runs on his six
[SPEAKER_00]: months later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we're so like small,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not like he tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying is this happens all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurt my feelings pretty bad because I'm
like releasing all these pictures and then
[SPEAKER_03]: like I look online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like around Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was around Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Rainbow Runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was so fucking clever
with that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we live in the rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my one of my employees,
a great guy, Devon, he was like Rain
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow Runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I fucking hated it at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else was like, ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, you know,
because I wanted Rainbow Runs,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and especially like anything
with runs at that time was so hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually it grew on me like
nobody's business because I made it right
[SPEAKER_03]: there in the rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like so I was like, you know,
this strain is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we made it right here and the name's
perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were right, Devon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these names, though, they there's
so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are coming up with weird
stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Orangutan titties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's some good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike from Exotic has some crazy names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His red pop and like so he has some good
descriptions of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like red pop smells like red soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what's up with that cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only flowered it and then it died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good breeder, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at red runs, which is a
cross of that, which is the runs times the
[SPEAKER_00]: red pop, that's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chirps really come out in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has the chirps that you like from
the red pop with more of a candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes across in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's a little the red pop
is a little punchy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got purple punch, like smells amazing,
grows amazing, gets you excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to smoke a joint of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a little bit of a letdown,
not as bad as purple punch, because purple
[SPEAKER_00]: punch for me is a big letdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to smoke it, it's cardboard
chirps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not missing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what it tastes like,
because you've never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cut of slurricane that I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slurricane's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I never actually got, by the time like
it was around, everyone was like shit
[SPEAKER_03]: smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, man, if it smells like the
slurricane I got, it smells delicious in
[SPEAKER_03]: the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one cross away from being amazing,
because I think you can cross it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of other stuff and it comes out great
or cross it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking for stuff and you get
some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, it's just for me,
the purple punch by itself is a letdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen great crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has great potential,
but by itself, I don't, I want the joint
[SPEAKER_00]: to taste, cause I'm a joint smoker,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, when I fire
something up, I want it to taste good all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And purple punch just does not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extract's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with the extract, but man,
it's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a strawberry tear?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely like strawberry ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, some of your stuff, it smokes,
not even some of it, all of it smokes down
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talk about ash, whatever,
but like, dude, the flavor on the can of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic stuff, your banana ruts is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that cut, I feel like you guys do
that cut justice more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out the most candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny cause like, so I got the
cut and I gave it out to a bunch of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and we've all, everybody's grown
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've saw, I've seen the different
iterations in different substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things, whatever you guys do,
it comes out candy, candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're probably the only ones who grow it
with mixed light, you know, in the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses, some strains just shine with
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And down to the roots, it tastes like
banana candies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're a Skittles nut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that Skittles inside tastes
better or Skittles outside or in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I would say, the indoor,
because you gave me Skittles from Kana and
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles that you grew indoor side by
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indoor tasted better.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana Skittles is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that indoor Skittles, it just was so
loud, like mouth coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it, it's candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes in, get that long finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana's did that too, but it was just a
little louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I mean, and maybe the chirps
are a little softer on the outdoor and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay full price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even care what they cost type
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm, I'm super happy paying for what
stuff is worth when it comes down to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're buying the experience at
that point and they both give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Skittles, but Skittles and cocoa,
I'm okay with Skittles and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, weed that's grown well is going to
taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the substrate honestly is
whatever, you know, I've had good tasting,
[SPEAKER_03]: no taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had good till and I've had shitty
tasting, no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy who grew it still bragged
about the shitty tasting, no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had good hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially back in the day, even three
part with hydro growing really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog grown back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends used to grow fucking three part
and maybe it was just because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucas formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like back in the day,
dude, some of the stuff grown in fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool back in the day though,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a huge Rockwell fan personally for
flowers, for veg plants, for moms,
[SPEAKER_00]: for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Rockwell is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to keep things sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: For clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it for clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't overwater it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I always try to tell my guys,
they like pick up the trays.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, it's light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like fucking touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's still got moisture in it,
it's too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, no, it's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, water's just like totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's felt dry, but it's really not
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get so used to working with
Rockwell and the weight that it should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a certain point, once you've been
working with Rockwell, it's really easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never flowered in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've never flowered in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always just done soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about cocoa?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done cocoa twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't like growing in cocoa for the
longest time because my partner that we
[SPEAKER_00]: did for a game in a garage in back in the
day, he's like, oh, we're going to try
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff called cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in these blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These blocks, you have to like spray them
with water, put them in a pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: break them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to pH balance them too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you have to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water them with pH balance, water and
nutrients and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after doing, I think it was for 300
something plants, it was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is way better anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how can you go wrong with soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was stuck on soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the soil argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've done that with LEDs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated LEDs in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like LEDs now, but I like adjustable
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some good ones on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better than they were in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the purple LEDs, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still expensive as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still expensive, but like,
and HPS gives you a great product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You prefer HPS with CMH, is that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, I like the mixed spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: HPS with CMH.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't usually like to turn my
Gavitas past like 700 Watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a thousand Watts is actually like
a lot for a plant, especially,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in a greenhouse, say the sun
comes out and you got your thousands on,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only takes a second to cook them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just like to definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys still use Gavitas in the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Still use Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we bought like 400 Lux and then the
two weeks later, they went out of
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as those go out, you know, the pile of
Lux is getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to eventually like
figure out a different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember going to the industry
parties?
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to be so like fun and everyone
was like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years ago, industry parties were
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cups were different, you know,
but when you have it new and fresh and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, there's still that passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's passionate people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's passionate people out there,
but it's just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I do remember when outdoor was
more expensive than indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like $4,500 a pound for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I even remember going up to Mendo
with my buddy Steve and driving and he,
[SPEAKER_00]: he paid me a couple ounces to go up to
Mendo, drive him up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this before cell phones,
but there was pages or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we had to meet this guy at a specific
time at this, this parking lot and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would fucking flash light and we'd walk
towards the light or whatever with the
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'd come up behind you and then
give you the pound and do the exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole different world back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the days, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were like, that was Mendo perps back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just, just called perps,
but it was like from Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the first one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like the one before all of them or
is Purple Kush first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think they're all from,
yeah, Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Kush has probably been around since
the seventies or eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Purple Kush is, but there's so many
different Purple Kushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Trichome Technologies,
they have their own special Purple Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's other Purple Kushes that I've
seen on the market that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was one circulating, clones of it
were circulating in the nineties and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like Afghani, like purple Afghan
fucking super pungent, super amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it taste like that grape flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't taste as grapey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more gassy and funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, my Purple Kush was like grapey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was grapey for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was grapey Purple Kushes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like grape turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of like grape or floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love grape turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel is still one of my favorites and
always will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel was heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was Soma's Lavender?
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: That one was so bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a bitch to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it was good, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some bio canna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, that was the mix back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bio canna.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard that in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you though, man, the bio canna
Lavender, that shit came out of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma had one called Soma's A+.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma A+, that was going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a short leafy plant that was the
most pungent, loudest, like funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small and squatty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With big leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super didn't like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, I guess they call it Rockbud too
is the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soma A+, is where we had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy gave me some to grow and I only
grew it one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same if you get it,
cause I've since bought seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same as the cut that was
going around, but still amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy who was growing that,
he was the one who was growing a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Seattle Sour back in the day too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had that Seattle Sour, the Tang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys ever smoke the Tang?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a little bit about the Tang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some interesting stories for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tang was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Tang, there was one Tang that was
bred by Canorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took credit for our line, but we had
our own Tang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was any relation to,
but it was like powdery Tang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like fucking powdery Tang.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd it grow like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew more like a Sativa than an Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like long flowering, like a 10
week, maybe nine, nine, 10 week big
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it throw bananas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember it throwing bananas,
but I remember the smell of it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: Tang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled like, powdery Tang,
not like mixed into, it smelled like that
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of red hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of red hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Tang that I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm pretty sure Canorado had a
Tang back around 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of fucking bad-ass crosses
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good genetics, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan was, dude, I love Romulan from
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't ever hear about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's coming back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, Bruxy, he was on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's breeding Romulan into some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw someone posting about the
Romulan S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake sells Romulan S1s from Romulan
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Sativas, you're going towards
Sativas too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to end up in Sativa
world, like maybe a couple of years from
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is, honestly, if you ask me
my favorite thing to smoke, it's candy
[SPEAKER_03]: gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still just want to start doing other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because who knows what's out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Try something new with what I love,
and then maybe you'll create something
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacon grease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for them bacon grease turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacon grease, I mean, the Wagyu is
kind of greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of greasy turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wagyu?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wagyu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still never had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, House of Cultivar has the fried
chicken turps on one of their crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there, ask Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got it growing a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when he does, you got to go check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like, when you squeeze it,
he has one that's like fried chicken,
[SPEAKER_00]: one that smells like General Tsao's
chicken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just making up shit.
Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the sky's the limit, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine with what we've seen so far,
you can really go anywhere with turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sky is the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just a matter of breeding towards
specific things to where you get those
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some really good plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, who did that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ripple plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Josh Freeman, the guy who brought
the, we were talking about the guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: brought the Durbin to the Bay Area back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Josh Freeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed that with the sour diesel and
created the ripple plum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a cherry cheesecake and some other
stuff, a raspberry cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember which, but it was like,
he had some really, really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics back in the day that he was
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sour diesel, he's another sour diesel
lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I miss sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you at though?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, he grew, my buddy Josh grew
some, but I just haven't seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to see the sour diesel again that
just punches you in the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like it more than Skittles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I like it more than Skittles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a pound of each.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can choose one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to walk away with?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the sour from back in the day all
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, not even, it was like a cat
piss and sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we could talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'd go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get the cat piss if it's the,
but the sour, that was the real sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would, that would just, you open the
bag and it would just hit you in the face
[SPEAKER_00]: and the buds would stick to the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could stick them to the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be so gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can stick it to the window with
your thumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife hates that shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: She hates it, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stick it to the wall and she's like,
you're fucking up the wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep sticking fucking weed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it'll stick to the wall, stick to the
glass, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you think, you think we're
going towards Sativas or are you just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get as word Sativas and say,
fuck everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was kind of saying, like I want to,
I want to breed to be more creative,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, in what I'm doing, opposed to
like before when I was kind of just making
[SPEAKER_03]: what everyone else was and just following
trends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see a trend of taking the things
that candy gas that you like and then
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing it to all these other weird
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and I don't, but you know,
honestly, James, I don't really follow a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of other people to know like what the
rest of the industry is doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just live up in squim and a
little mountain town, my little weed farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of like tuned off from the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I come down to Cali, I see you and I
see some of my other friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of like cannabis industry
that's happening here is just fucking mind
[SPEAKER_03]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like back home, I won't go into
another grow room all year and then I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: come to California and see 10 in two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them are just like state of the
art and incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all like fighting to be the
best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like blown the fuck away,
you know, especially in Sacramento right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sacramento right now for indoor
cultivation is just going off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I go take tours there, I'm really
just blown away by the amount of like
[SPEAKER_03]: money that's there and money that's spent
on these girls, money that's really spent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like my farm we built like by
hand and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like we built our farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we know the ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know our electrical panels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, Tim built our controllers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like our farm was built by us by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: By scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we got enough money, we got another
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we got enough money, we got another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we didn't take on a bunch
of investment money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did it all the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what we knew, you know, which is
what we knew, we just followed our hearts
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, in an industry that's right
now just overcrowded with Chad's it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like, but yeah, well that's going to come
and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sure hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, yeah, there is a bunch of
Chads and there's a lot of misinformed
[SPEAKER_00]: people and people that have never tried
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more you expose people to things
like quality, the more they appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and then they want quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the same, at the same time,
people can only get what they can afford.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, you know, I don't really
know a lot of people who were fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: killing it like we used to, not just in
this industry, you know, like just in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, just in general right now,
it's kind of like fucking I got 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I get with that 40 dollars?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, which is just kind of like how
it's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't I've personally never
bought an eighth pass 40 bucks ever in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my life, never in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was a kid, you know, if someone had
some fucking and they were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yo, it's 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, just take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get another one tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I go into a store,
you know, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been growing, you know, legal
cannabis for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, me to go get an eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the funny thing is I'm always so
fucking leery.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like going to the shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, what's good?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, fucking liar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, no, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's good?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you not want to sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me because you're going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the last of and you're going to take
it home and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and then you're,
you know, just it's kind of up to the
[SPEAKER_03]: budtender at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got hash planted one time and I've ever
been I've been jaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the budtender was like this hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was and I was looking at him and I
was like, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, oh, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like I remember like saying to
myself, are you about to buy an eighth
[SPEAKER_03]: hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, dude, and I was like,
it's the one it's the one I bought it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I soon as I pulled it out, I was like,
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I broke it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I rolled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took two hits, threw it out the fucking
window.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's the one damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got me on some hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got hash planted literally any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the budtenders are there
all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was maybe it was a fresh batch of hash
plant and I was about to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I'd never experienced
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like White Widow sounds really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, typically White Widow isn't
what I would normally get from,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if it's real White Widow,
I don't get excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good breeder, I think,
for European companies, the White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did have a White Widow back in the
day that was fire from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day it was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like strong and pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the widow that I mostly know is like
very vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it vanilla-fies everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cross it with OG, you're going to
get that's what happened to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crossed, the real OG genetics got
over there for OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of these seed companies bred
it with White Widow for seed production
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes and vanilla-fied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me and you, you'd be like,
that's not OG Kush, but the OG Kush that
[SPEAKER_00]: they knew for a long time over there was
the vanilla-fied version.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sweet one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was sweet and not gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not what I know is OG Kush at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, even the structure wasn't even
OG for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now obviously- Was that weak and
brittle?
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of OG is weak and it's very
finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is not, it's not something that
you can just ignore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically needs support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might overwater, you might underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might push it too high and it fucking
burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it had shitty node spacing and
you wanted to spaghetti out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the OG Kush that I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just needed a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of love.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was worth growing for personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: To smoke, it was always really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was worth growing to sell to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SFV, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: People wanted OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the exotic of its day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until the year it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a sad year for them, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been holding on to that cut
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never give it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had the packs and everyone was
fucking selling mad cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And them dudes were just like,
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that happened with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream had its day too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream was top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk shit, but Blue Dream was top
shelf at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I got that cut in 07 and the
dude who fucking grew it, he grew it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a bank?
[SPEAKER_03]: In a bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fucking abandoned bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he had two tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everything was still located.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he grew it with Humboldt Nutrients
Master A and B.
[SPEAKER_03]: And make the weed chemi and bright.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So terpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was terpy or the lime
green and crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks so good too, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Blue Dream, the really good indoor
Blue Dream, smokes good as far as terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blue Dream I'm talking about too has
no super silver haze traits whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strong on the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, tight buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people with these other
things they call Blue Dream and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: that ain't fucking it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not nice and tight, it's not the
one you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it stacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell just when it's vegging the
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the leaves are very specific
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has thinner leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just grows super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the thing I liked about it the
most is basically it was super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always felt good growing it and it
never gave you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it would just crush too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would crush over two pounds of light
back in the day, which was the goal,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if you had a thousand watt bulb
and you hit two pounds of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were crushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're ready to retire in six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with the Blue Dream in 07.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.2 pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it like, 08?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I can't sell this fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned into the Blue Nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had one year of just thriving with
that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that was the Blue Nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those packs just sat, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not having money because I couldn't sell
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to sit on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a harvest season and there was
outdoor, but the cut had got out to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the guys that were crushing it for
a long time thought they were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like myself, we were thinking,
oh yeah, we're going to crush it and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I even had the Patience Choice
Collect, PCC in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Berkeley, PCC had promised to buy
five pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew I'd have money for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there, show them the flower and
they're like, sorry, we can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got some for 1800.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was when we was 3200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I show them the stuff and I'm like,
dude, you guys said you're going to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just bought some for 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I was like, can I see it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't as good as mine was,
but it was comparable in the sense that 18
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend that kind of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are always about bargains and
making money for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you get the Christmas money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I did not get the Christmas money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to borrow money from my parents that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally it was a bad year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had to borrow money for Christmas
presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the roughest years that I
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Blue Nightmare is what we
called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first year, whole backyard full of
Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next year I split it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the Berry White and then the Humble
Ogre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever?
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the Berry White.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Berry White was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great for outdoor, but it tasted
like straight soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it right, it's the most
dirt-like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirt taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was fabulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, everyone bought it and was stoked on
it until they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next year, everyone was like,
no, we don't want no more Berry White,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, Berry White had its year for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it had the one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, good stuff, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's been so many different
genetics that were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever grow or see the Aota that was
up in, that was like Sonoma, Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, and now we're all about Gelatos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gelatos, Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how do you feel about color?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it doesn't matter even a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that matters about color is
those packs sell more to me personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to making different
genetics, I'd like them to be purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as things that I've found in
the last couple of years have not been
[SPEAKER_03]: purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't check your box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're a fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: The end of the day, what sells me when I'm
picking something is when I'm smoking the
[SPEAKER_03]: joint and I'm like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you pick a winner, dude, you keep
looking back at it after every hit like,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy shit, this is hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe I'm fucking getting these
chirps right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you let someone else hit
it and they're like, oh, you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, back to me, bro, because I got one
plant to try this on and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: share no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you fucking go back and how much of
this one do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this reminds me of a time when I
was at your house and it was at night and
[SPEAKER_00]: you fired something up and we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tasted it since, but it was
candy, candy, something super candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was it could have been my
godfather.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Gabagool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for sure the Gabagool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the triangle Kush Gelato cross I
made, which is my favorite out of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: Gelato crosses I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gabagool is hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gabagool is the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, it's kind of more
green, but it's not that pretty,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks to grow too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as bad, but honestly, even Z,
I have harder times growing other things
[SPEAKER_03]: in Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: Z just got a veg good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you give it an extra two weeks
and it will eventually just start taking
[SPEAKER_03]: water like everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this new shit called XYZ.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think that I think that I heard that
it came from Dio Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it did or not,
but that was what I fucking heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that shit is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is so fucking good if you nail it
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the turps on it just fucking scream.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: The favorite thing I smoked last year that
was new was that XYZ.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that I can fucking really start
growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crush it, you know, because it's so... The
extract is going to be super good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pen?
[SPEAKER_03]: The pen will be good, but it didn't squish
for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like when we squish,
I was like, the fuck kind of return is
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it did squeeze, it like the turps
almost separated from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't come out like a normal Rosengoo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out more liquidy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it was a darker in color,
but just kind of like, it was more of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never ever seen anything squish water
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just smoke the sap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't think you could sell
that every one month.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like really beautiful Rosengoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this shit was screaming, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you smear it all over your joint
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's still some loud crosses to
be made for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some loud candy crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many directions with candy that
you can still go that people haven't gone
[SPEAKER_00]: before too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the name might be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, show me some
peppermint patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's an avenue that still
should be explored seed wise?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, hunting more candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a potential for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have somebody doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's guys hunting washers and
there's guys hunting this and there's guys
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a market for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think candy hasn't fully been
exploited yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been exploited, but not to where it
can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked candy so long that I wanted to
just try to get something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should, because then you'll get fresh
and you can go back to candy if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably will end up screwing right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe going funky with candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those jelly bellies, they're like
barf and vomit and all those ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could... Did you ever put those in the
good pack?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You throw 20 in the good pack and then,
you know, everyone's eating the good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you teach your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prank people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nasty ones in with the good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have the jelly belly machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know what I'm going to do before I
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than dosing somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's never fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's never fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not with the jelly beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do fishing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're big into fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten big into fishing over the
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten big over the last salmon
steelhead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love to fish, especially because
I need like healthy things to do to help
[SPEAKER_03]: take my mind off everyday stresses of,
you know, growing cannabis in 2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids are stressful, but growing fucking
weed in 2024 is some real shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got four kids.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, I do want to say that I
made a Chad comment earlier, but honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: like if you're pushing right now,
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're still in it, and you're still
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hats off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hats off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because literally if you're still in it
fighting, that means that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something worth fighting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the next five years is going to
fucking say it all though, because I've
[SPEAKER_03]: watched so many great growers fucking tap
out, especially in the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people going into back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend who just found out
yesterday he's gone back into
[SPEAKER_00]: construction, you know, and there's people
doing whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the weed's not expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your buddy who did, you know, going back
into carpentry more than likely he did
[SPEAKER_03]: carpentry before he started growing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been growing cannabis since I was 19.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 41.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the only job I've ever had the
thought of me picking up a fucking hammer
[SPEAKER_03]: at 42.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I better make this shit work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to work though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and the thing too about
cannabis is it always ebb and flows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the plant itself ebb and flows from
beginning till end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it pulsates, you know, it drinks
water as a pulse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breathes as a pulse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shuts off and on like a pulse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this industry is a pulse too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I was young, like Bush
shut down the borders in 01 after the
[SPEAKER_03]: terrorist bomb, you know, fucking them
towers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I was like, Oh my God,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get the Canadian anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started growing weed, you know,
sort of evolved to that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: from that, because I was like,
do you remember droughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't know what a fucking
drought is, like it happened every year
[SPEAKER_03]: come August and September, everyone's
scrapping for shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell these people what a drought is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, weed would run dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the packs that you'd have would be
gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dealer would be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one would have anything between,
what was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: July, August, September, because hot
months were dry months a lot of times
[SPEAKER_03]: because there wasn't, people weren't
banging depths out that much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like circled around that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you hit indoor, but like a
lot of times it would sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there'd be times where you
couldn't get it from anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smelt resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just would run out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the shit that would come back in
would get bought out so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The price would go up to something stupid
where everyone would be competing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: same mids at best, you know, and try to
like, the money would just, it'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be scraping your bong to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: People did that too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that I did that,
but maybe I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventh grade was rough for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you gotta do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never drank bong water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never drank bong water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Never drank bong water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I put vodka in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how everybody got caught into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put the vodka in and then you did
shots of bong water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nasty.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He makes it with orange Sobe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Sobe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell everybody about the
kind of stuff you guys sell from Kanto
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics?
[SPEAKER_03]: We sell a lot of different products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flour, vapes, concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make distillate carts, flavored
distillate carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our newest carts are flavored THCA
liquid diamond carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys are calling them here,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Liquid diamond carts where it's Terps and
THCA infused together correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really making a great product
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: One that I think is honestly going to take
over the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just dropped a couple of weeks ago and
they're already catching on.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I'm really stoked about
with these carts, the main thing is the
[SPEAKER_03]: access and convenience to taking a great
hit full of the right ratio of terpenes to
[SPEAKER_03]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fucking puts your dick in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fucks you up real good and... That was
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucks you up real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's like 80% THCA,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're going to get fucked up from a
cart and your throat's not going to hurt
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're going to smoke it all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been a cart guy until we
created this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm just like hooked on these
carts, which is kind of deadly because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking ripping them all day where I
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooked on Phonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great street name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys, you have some other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your Whoop-Ass too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got Whoop-Ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Fruity Pebbles, which is,
I don't think anyone in Cali has seen this
[SPEAKER_03]: yet, but it's THCA with the botanical
flooring.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look just like Dippin' Dots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is another product that we're the
only ones who made that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do lines of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dippin' Dots, so you dab that stuff
and it's got terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's infused with... Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever, you dabbed THCA ever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is, it's fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We added flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it kicks your ass and it tastes
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kicks your ass and it tastes good,
which is basically what everyone wants
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, which is good flavor and to get
faded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I think, basically,
I want to do and give everybody the best
[SPEAKER_03]: price point to get at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where can they find your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries all over Washington state?
[SPEAKER_03]: All over Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a bunch of stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask for it by name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to share with everybody,
Kyle's been a huge part of my life as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as breeding, a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and Tim are both contributors to the
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're credited as a
contributor, but you've contributed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: information I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to let everybody know about
the breeding book that we got out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can Organics is featured in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim wrote the reversal recipe,
his partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be able to have a book like
this if it wasn't for people like you and
[SPEAKER_00]: your partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, James.
