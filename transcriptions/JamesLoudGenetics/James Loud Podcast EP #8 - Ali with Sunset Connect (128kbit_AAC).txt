[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is James Loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we've got Ali from Sunset Connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great having you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we actually have a lot of mutual
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go back into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out we do, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny talking to people before
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you realize that, shit,
we had direct connection with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think both being from the area
and then the connection to the rave scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which kind of evolved into the
cannabis scene to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of those players,
a lot of our old friends are now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even when the first time I saw
your logo, it reminded me of a rave flyer
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also panhandle records.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Elijah Mayhew from back in the
day, he's like one of my best friends
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the panhandle with the Muni style
logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the, it's just, you see it,
you recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ingrained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you're from the Bay,
you know that logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elijah was definitely an inspiration,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always loved his brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the ESDJCo brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another old school brand that was
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, talking to you, one thing that I
realized ever more is that the Bay OGs
[SPEAKER_02]: have been around for a minute and most of
them haven't done anything but cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why we grow such good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been smoking forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the one thing I can say is
that the weed back in the Bay in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people talk about how great the
flower is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think the stuff that we
would get, even the stuff on average,
[SPEAKER_00]: the indoor stuff was up to par with the
best stuff today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not as homogenous as today.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't all gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got, you meet a guy and he gives
you something that you've never smelled or
[SPEAKER_02]: tasted before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, cause I think the breeders weren't
hanging out as much with each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was less cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were popping seeds and getting
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a handful of people
popping seeds and you could get clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from certain places, but it's like,
there was still stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, we were getting European
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were getting stuff from South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a mix of all kinds of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Durbin was going around.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the beauty back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of land races and a few land race,
Caliweed crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali-O.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another one that I really liked.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had stuff that was going into
the seventies that you just don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Cali-O, for example, like it
would, I think, cause it vegged so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: People weren't, yeah, at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything became an eight-weeker.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we lost a lot of varietals.
[SPEAKER_02]: When everything became an eight-weeker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary, it's when it went to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a minute.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lamb's bread was one of those,
somebody tried to send us, sold us a
[SPEAKER_02]: lamb's bread cut like six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were scoping it and you're like,
no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did produce that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should give you one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love lamb's bread, Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Jamaican varieties are super
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the other thing in the Bay is back
in the day, I realized like you had
[SPEAKER_02]: growers that really, really concentrated
and specialized in one thing, like the
[SPEAKER_02]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or then you'd meet someone that was only
growing hazes, but had the haze market
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of on lockdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the OG guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all he grew is OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he probably got a pound per light with
the old OG guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but nobody talked to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody went and grew the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like this unwritten law of this
is my strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm known for is what you're known
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were all kind of complimenting each
other's packs, not trying to sell the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole box for one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people got into breeding
that way because they wanted something
[SPEAKER_00]: that was different than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanted to do something of their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted my own sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all my friends grew sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real sour is super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you have a room hermed out and next
thing you know, you got cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could happen too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a seed company, some of these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh yeah, we got a million
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to do with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about checking them or testing
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on I learned my lessons selling
stuff that was untested once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned it early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like even still, I will sell
stuff that has intersex traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to make people aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to my website, you look,
there's a couple of the genetics that we
[SPEAKER_00]: sell on there that have intersex traits,
but I think they're special, but I'm aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm letting you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to buy it,
you're also aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the contest winner, we'll see,
we're announcing our contest winner on
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd loud loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent out a hundred packs of seeds,
a little over a hundred in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 18 entries back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've narrowed it down to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to smoke two of them today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like some of the people got
intersex traits and maybe part of it is by
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them into flower too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's in the genetics, but I feel
like the genetics are so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke this stuff, you'll give me
your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, man, it's sometimes it's,
it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as long as it's disclosed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been, we've been growing the
gummies for about two years now has a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very stable, but when it is to
your point, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Mike has made a whole company
based on stuff that may or may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex traits, but it's all phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love exotic by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely are always down to pop and
try to your point because when you do find
[SPEAKER_02]: something, it's usually just fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I can say about exotic that
I appreciate is something that he does is
[SPEAKER_00]: he'll take something and he'll work it
into something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his red pop, I wasn't a huge fan of the
red pop because it has this purple punch
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like let down when I was growing
it, I was growing it and I was doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like cherry cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a special one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end I had one of my
friends flower some out and I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it and I'm like, Oh, it's purple
punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple punch is a little disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was one cross away from being
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it with the runs and had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what the red runs was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the red ones runs was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, really, really red runs is
that red pop times runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I messed with the orange blow pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally smelled like orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew it and I called all my girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this shit smells like orange
crush, like actual oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet, sugary, you know, exotics is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: His stuff is sugary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a different taste in the Bay
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very particular taste in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep going back to Skittles,
which that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried the Polyshore,
the Polynesian?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll give you a cut of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's one of those super old school
90s strains we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably takes about eight to nine
weeks at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let her go for a night and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you smoke it, just the smoke
alone is so thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow, okay, this is a really
special smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like notes of cinnamon,
earthy, and some weird funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always call it the dog shit terpene
because I can't really put a better name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always had cat piss back in the day,
the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that stuff was, cat piss in the
90s was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another one that only few people
grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a cat piss guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a cat piss guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your cat piss from him and only
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine was a guy named Gus and my buddy
Steve, but they all got it from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was $60 straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd buy ounces for $480.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good old times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like shit in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat piss that we got was not chunky
fat buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like shredded calyx sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you opened the bag and you're like,
God damn, what just happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't open the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knew it would be in your pocket or it
would be in a backpack or be in tin bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ammonia on that was strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience with cat piss,
it wasn't gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people try to say gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was thyls, but it was skunk thyls.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about roadkill skunk,
that's the closest to roadkill skunk that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought it had more of a pungent
sort of blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so pungent that it would burn your
nostrils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think a lot of people didn't
even like the smell of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like... No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends like, oh, this is gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would immediately pack a
bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I remember when the European
genetics really started coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started getting through the third floor
through some of the... What was the one in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the blue something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blue Sky Cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blue Sky Cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clones in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the clones in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Blue Sky Cafe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where we got the Blue Dream
clone from the guys like, our buddy's dad
[SPEAKER_02]: went to buy clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy's like, give me something that
not everybody grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I got this really sad
looking plant here and it was Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our buddy's dad took it to his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little finicky and veg, but then it just
fucking got the Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's how we were some of the
people that hoarded out Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as Blue Dream is the apical of
structure, yield, all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream, it checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it doesn't check the boxes on the
terpene profile or the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it came out, it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wanted Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going for $37,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think people still like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't want to admit they like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's a milder effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a lighter sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that was the one for going on
a hike or if we're going bowling or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever we were doing back in the day,
that would be like, okay, let's smoke some
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my road trip weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have to drive for eight hours,
I don't want to get too tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke some Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're smiling the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had that in Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Green Crack was...
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd grow because the flowering time was
very similar on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could grow them together in the
same room because I liked harvesting all
[SPEAKER_00]: my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to have to harvest,
then wait two more weeks or three more
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have half an empty room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, wasting your electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Green Crack was good for like the
first couple of weeks because you get
[SPEAKER_00]: super ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then your tolerance would go so high,
it wouldn't even get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd smoke big old bats of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing you know,
fuck, it's not getting you high anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that way about a lot of the current
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think also the reason people mix up
strains so much is because they all have a
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get pretty immune.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people don't notice it because
they switch so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think most of the genetics do
have ceilings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you test for yourself to judge if
you like the flower, my usual rule is I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: only smoke an ounce of this, no other weed
for the next two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I like it, then I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can smoke an ounce in two days and
not want to smoke anything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's a good strain to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find those kind of genetics,
especially even just the genetic side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of flower out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of amazing flower out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to go read.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to grow good weed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the also problem is the
automation, the fertigation, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is buying the same shit from the
same people now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really kind of loses that personal
touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as just back in the day,
if we had houses that were closer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: beach in the sunset, that would guaranteed
be done three, four days earlier and have
[SPEAKER_02]: a completely different expression than the
ones that were up on the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same mom, same cuts.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of one thing I miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're in Napa, when you have
multiple wineries growing the same grapes
[SPEAKER_02]: or even similar clones, but just their
location just really makes a difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, especially with outdoor weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a point where outdoor
was more expensive than indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the sour diesel days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like you get sour diesel from
specific people and it would come out,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it was the same cut,
it would come out two different ways from
[SPEAKER_00]: two different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then buyers are like, that's not the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's when the rename game
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the way back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so let's dive into some of
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are proper doings, no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these ones I have identified as soil
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're soil grown based on the
effect, the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys who entered this contest,
narrowing it down to the top 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys all grew amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some you could tell were like more of the
cocoa grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we got any rock wall,
although we'll find out when I start
[SPEAKER_00]: asking more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the contestants disclose it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I'll ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a fair competition where you give
everybody the same clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to win the lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get better genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person may or may not be the best
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a unique test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is this that we're smoking right
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Loud Loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a Zerios times ZBX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zerios is a Zerbert times cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ZBX is the Skittles back cross
with the Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a good amount of diversity
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little candy turp, but I think a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been smoking these for a week and
a half now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm finding is like a lot of the
cereal milk expression is dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're finding a little Skittles
here, Sherbert-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cereal milk and Sherbert kind of have
similar like that musky profile a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like cereal milk is a little
heavier and Sherbert's a little brighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like has a little bit more citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're getting a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the unicorns are more of the Z
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's associated with the
structure too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones that don't have quite as
much structure, like is nice of a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are going to have more Skittles
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just goes hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherp has a lot of structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherp does have a lot of structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I was in the sunset and
somebody, one of my buddies said,
[SPEAKER_02]: take Mario might've had a landlord
inspection or something, but this guy was
[SPEAKER_02]: holding some bombs for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went over there and I looked at it
and I'd never seen a Sherbert cup before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 2004, five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds more like it.
12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go into this guy's house and it's
gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just got this bud structure that's
bubbly, but still a little Fox taily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was literally what we consider
designer weed today, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at my dude, what the fuck is
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just called sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember it was called sunset Sherbert in
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turned into Sherbinsky and
into Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Mario is phenomenal by the
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always been super kind to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a character for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get packs off of him back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up getting this guy,
Travis, some of the packs and a whole seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one seed and that one seed built
his seed company over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the beginning of it,
you know, that's all it takes was that one
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he did a lot of stuff beyond that,
but that was like, that one seed was a
[SPEAKER_00]: game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the best stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some backseat that turns you into,
into a name in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when the genetics weren't super
prevalent over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we, I remember when we were in
college and I would go home to visit and I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew up two hours outside of Amsterdam,
I would drive to Amsterdam and get as much
[SPEAKER_02]: like Euro weed as I could and literally
fly it back with me in like the nineties
[SPEAKER_02]: through SFO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because back then there was more flavors
in, in Holland than we had here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the exact opposite of today
where the now that's completely flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have thousands of flavors and they
still grow in amnesia haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've renamed amnesia haze techniques
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: A million times probably by now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also sold a lot of blackjack back
in the legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another one of our kind of
signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen that since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on ease in 2017, I think our blackjack
was the number one selling flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sold a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackjack, black Domina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our blackjack was black Domina and,
and Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the expression was so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it, it was dark too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a grayish purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a dark purple, but a really nice
grayish purple hue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really uppity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people call it their workout weed in
the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, I think red Congolese has
kind of made a comeback over the last like
[SPEAKER_00]: four years on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, there's a couple of people
growing it and it had hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another, you know, hoplite and
Viroids fucked up a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many in California right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we went back to popping hella
seeds right now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with seeds, it's transmissible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have nice heirloom seeds that we've
been hoarding and collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should probably give you some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got some for you guys as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the genetics and store
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you store them, they're good
for a long time if you store them
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just put them in your drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in anywhere past Oakland,
you're probably going to be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live in Sacramento, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets too high unless you have air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even then, with that fluctuation in
temperature, your seeds go better.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the humidity you recommend for
storing seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So humidity low, low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put desiccants in mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drier you store them, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use lab fridges that has zero humidity
in there, you know, but like they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: glass jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've seen charts and it's like
the longer you plan on storing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower you want that humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you're facility is unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put some work into this and I think
this is just accumulation of my partner
[SPEAKER_00]: and I and all the stuff we've learned
along the way to actually put it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility of this scale, doing what we're
doing, kind of trying to change the game,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just doing what everybody else is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more of a biotech company than we
are a nursery or a breeding facility or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely the impression that you
get when you walk in here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not trying to be anything but
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to do the best we can
and trying to push the bar the best way we
[SPEAKER_00]: know how.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a lot of fun though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, and then coming into this
place every day is not the worst way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day when I walk into my
manufacturing spot, I'm like, if I told my
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 year old self that I have a hash
factory one day, I'm growing my own weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's all legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's talking, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a dream come true to an extent,
but it's all legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a nightmare with the way that
some things in our industry are,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is like, was like the main reason
that I decided to really be active and try
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the chairman of the San Francisco
oversight committee and of the state
[SPEAKER_02]: advisory board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought people like you and me
that have actually seen this shit for 25
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking years, we're not getting a seat at
the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of lobbyists and outdoor
cultivation groups, which I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: they shouldn't have a seat at the table,
but they weren't going after the old guy
[SPEAKER_02]: selling, you know, hundreds of pounds
over, you know, in the nineties already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think California is really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then letting somebody like me sit at
that table and listening to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also realized right now in the
industry, the way it's going, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: corporates going out of business with the
shit that's happening with herbal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the med man debt, the harbor side
that's like, listen to us more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an existing industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an existing craft beer industry
that was crushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have had a thousand anchor
steams and you went for five Budweiser's
[SPEAKER_02]: and now you're surprised at this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're surprised at the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, I think we talked
to, I've talked a little bit about anchor
[SPEAKER_00]: steam with some of the guests,
but they kind of we're here in part
[SPEAKER_00]: because of anchor steam, San Francisco,
Fred Maytag, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fred Maytag who wanted to start his own
microbrewery in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John from cutting edge, uncle John was
telling me the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, in the seventies he wanted to,
then they said, no, you need to join one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the big four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, no, that's not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he got dirt on all the politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had, PIs following the politicians
around and it was like one of the fastest
[SPEAKER_00]: bills ever changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's that kind of change that got
us to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's great being part of the
whole thing in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny you say anchor steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people come to our facility,
I always go, we kind of consider ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: the anchor steam of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do craft on a pretty industrial
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just cause we love what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like over all these years you
figure it out, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I see what you do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks more impressive than most biotech
companies and people don't realize that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, if you want clean, good genetics,
they have to come out of a place like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going into the direction
that everybody's going to have to go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we're doing something that's
going to be, you know, once federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization goes in and there's changes
and we have the FDA, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these organizations coming in,
they're going to change it and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, I mean, we're gearing up for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we built our facility, I got to build
it on a level that it'll pass a
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not cause I want to people think it's like
ego and you're doing it for like
[SPEAKER_02]: aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no dude, this was built so
there's no microbiological, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hazards here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that and that's why you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think, yeah, it's impressive
what you've built and thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about your
company and how you guys got your start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, we started growing weed in
college.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my partners and I met first day of
freshman year at USF bunch of 18 year olds
[SPEAKER_02]: that couldn't pay for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started growing, they started
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was moving a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I think that's kind of how we
know a few of our common friends in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rave scene started moving packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when I was about 20, um, my crew got
popped by the feds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us got popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody said anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody walked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was on probation for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddies were still growing cause
thankfully they didn't, they didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, probation for a few years,
finished probation, super traumatized,
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want anything to do with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, moved back to Germany for like five,
six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when medical really took off
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I was back three times a year
hanging out with my boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't like I wasn't coming home,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, 2010, my buddies came to
Germany, said, dude, pack up your shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not going to get busted again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this shit is legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd supply dispensaries, come back and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to our old heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, then when 2016 came around,
we saw the writing on the wall,
[SPEAKER_02]: decided to really lobby for a seat at the
table to be heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we didn't have a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were growing in 30 houses in the
sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't zoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, at that point, to your
point, you already had a company like gold
[SPEAKER_02]: seal that was growing red Congo and that
had a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Betty project, SF cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of outfits that were definitely in the Bay
view could probably transition,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we know that wasn't us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we were growing in houses and we
were producing our edibles and hash and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in the back of the plant cafe
kitchen and the commissary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is actually where I were SF
office of cannabis's first tour was we're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, go to the front, ask the
cashier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll walk you into the back to the
commissary where we're making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was totally breaking bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we had to transition and I
transitioned manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: First was the first manufacturer to open
in the city, pulled three out of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 permits for the first building permit
in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and not with like a big crew of
lawyers and shit, dude, just my,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my buddy part of my company is
a, is one of the better attorneys in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our growers are really smart, scientific
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we looked at building codes,
we figured it out, hired an architect and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and now sunset connected the number
one selling single gram pre-roll in the
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We beat Jeter's out of that spot,
which I'm really proud of for like a
[SPEAKER_02]: little SF dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and we kind of have to
restructure now cause you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: herbal and broke and they're really good
partner of ours and we now have to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: new distributor, but that's how this game
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta be flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta be nimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about being able to pivot and
having it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there's one thing I learned
from my partner, it's always have a plan
[SPEAKER_00]: B.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our plan B?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if this doesn't work, what's,
you know, we're thinking ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always have to plan B and then a
contingency.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that doesn't come through and that
can't just be another plan C that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you go, okay, if that happens,
we contract, we expand again, or we kill a
[SPEAKER_02]: few skews.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually one of the things that
made us most successful was setting aside
[SPEAKER_02]: what I know my small microcosm on it and
saying, okay, what are the, what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: data here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the data was the single gram joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we started with one skew
used to sell like 10,000 a month and now
[SPEAKER_02]: we're at seven of the same kind and sell
like a hundred thousand of them a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but we cut out flowers for them for
the time being topicals, edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cut out a lot of rationalized skews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doubling down on what you're good at
getting rid of the stuff that is
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we got here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's one of the flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have two Sativas, two Indicas and
two hybrids at any given point.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your morning commute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's based on the Muni ticket,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of our whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is your morning commute and this
is a Sunset Popsicle, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is actually blow pop, blow pop sugar
trim and Sunset Sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a trim joint that goes out the
door at an expensary for five bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we were like, we felt like,
dude, they offer nothing to somebody on a
[SPEAKER_02]: budget that still needs to smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still taste good probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming I just dry hit it and it
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, it is a sugar trim
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't, we don't make any,
we, you know, we don't hide that fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: but test that 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you'll ever get one that's
older than like two or three weeks in a
[SPEAKER_02]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the game too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most important parts
that I think a lot of people are dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: the ball on is realizing that this is a
product that needs to be fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want old dry shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want three month old weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like necessarily if it's been sitting on
the shelf, maybe if you harvested it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you stored it correctly and then you put
it out and I get a week after,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like, there's good,
there's ways you can do stuff now for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of people are dropping
the ball on how they, not only how they
[SPEAKER_00]: dry and cure it, but how long it sits on
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Processing is post-processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from batch sizing, you have a lot of,
you have a lot of influence on your
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it in small batches,
you can make 10 small batches,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we grind in like a hundred gram
batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most big pre-roll makers grind in five
pounds and it's dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a good solution for all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best solution actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm taking it from Laganitas
because that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they started shipping beer across the
country, they had it refrigerated in
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerated trucks going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the first ones that did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the big beer companies do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got anchor, not anchor steam,
but they got Heineken from over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam to start shipping their beer in
the water to the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not skunky like it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heineken bought Laganitas for half a half
a billion and then a full billion and but
[SPEAKER_00]: what we could do with the flowers,
we could all have it stored at 60 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer it at 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the dispensary has it at 60
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get it, you're getting 60
degrees coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're never getting it out of that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a better product for a
lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be a lot more
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of what I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consumer thinks that like there's no
consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see it in the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: One dispensary moves 130 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 30 of these a day and another one
does 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can adjust that by case sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have 125 and a 250 case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fast movers get the big case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medium movers get the medium, the small
case because they move through it fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you go to dispensaries and they have
four or five months old flower jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a year old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen year old products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now a year is the cutoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to return it to the vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven months, ten months, nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with hash, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like age hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally age hash for a year and then
I bust it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with flower pre-rolls,
edibles shouldn't be around for a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, definitely edibles have those
shelf lives for them based on food.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also degrade though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like my bread fresh too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to eat stale bread or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit gave me such cotton mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labor wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the refire, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, I do have to do a refire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could cure a little longer
still.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of effect, high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got me proper ripped and I haven't even
finished it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can taste it on the relight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these are, you know,
soil grown, living soil grown these
[SPEAKER_00]: entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, I like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles are such a good flavor enhancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like what forbidden fruit
was, but it's just forbidden fruit and
[SPEAKER_02]: purple punch just fucked everything up for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is with purple punch is purple
punch looks amazing on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think most of the Finos of
wedding cake are like this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look amazing on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow them, they yield really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like super Instagram beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to smoke them and it's
like, wait a second, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the terps?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, there's,
so Oreos is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple fritter, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing with apple fritter is I like
the effect of apple fritter, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like the fact that it smells like an apple
fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to smoke it and you don't
taste anything of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've said it before,
but all these things that aren't that
[SPEAKER_00]: great, like Oreos and purple punch,
I think they're all one good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the example of the red pop,
you know, which is actually it was purple
[SPEAKER_00]: punch or whatever, like whatever he used,
but purple punchy, his strawberry must
[SPEAKER_00]: have purple punch in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on some line going from there to the
red pop, it's like, it just takes work and
[SPEAKER_00]: effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all three ones that you named are
impossible to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all three of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even buyers that are looking for
completely different things, they'll tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you they don't want Oreos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Oreos, it's Zorios.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rename game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the rename game, I got escalated
with now the shape bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the rename game is now the
shape bag and rename game.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bigger and the more die cut your shape
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't get into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of also why we cater.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say we cater to like the heavy
smoker that has to watch their pocket and
[SPEAKER_02]: just wants a decent smoke still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like the people that I make
stuff for because I was always kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: selling to blue collar dudes in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just, that's my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is interesting how diverse it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the dispensaries back in the day were
super diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Ocean Street all the way to the one
like Spark and Green Door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kitama in between there Tarek with his
bossa.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these completely different vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shambhala, Navishan Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is just like we said,
it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be have been part of the old iteration
and of the new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always say, this is a global
experiment and California is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: place in this global experiment that
actually matters in terms of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, you know, they are looking at us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody's watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only two people in life that
you need to impress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your 18 year old self and your 80
year old self.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we could be doing okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 18 year old self for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pretty happy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, yeah, I've done all right by him.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where can people find you if they're
looking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in almost every dispensary
in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're pretty easy to find around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find us at PCF in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find us at all of the one plants
around the Bay and yeah, just follow us on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram at Sunset Connect and we can
always send you the right way.

to come by.
