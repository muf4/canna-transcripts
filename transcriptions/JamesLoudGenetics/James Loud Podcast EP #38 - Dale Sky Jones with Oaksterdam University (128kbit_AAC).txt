[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today my special guest is Dale
Sky-Jones, Chancellor of Oaksterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am fantastic, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Angela Baca, our mutual friend,
kind of hooked us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've met before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we have a mutual admiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Miss Baca and her talents.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rare to find someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I like waking up early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up about 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: and she wakes up at 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who don't know,
she is the editor for my book and she
[SPEAKER_01]: produced a lot of good content for the
book as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she wasn't just the editor,
but contributing writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's also working with you guys or
has worked with you in the past on a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's also the editor of the book we
just published, The Budtender's Guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also recently published a second guide
as well for writers, authors, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: so many journalists that are covering
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a style guide similar to the AP
guide that you might use to just know
[SPEAKER_03]: proper terminology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she also worked on another book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote the sustainability chapter and
several Oaksterdam experts worked on Ed
[SPEAKER_03]: Rosenthal's Cannabis Growers Guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, she is multi-talented and works
with us on a lot of projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's super organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's super driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a rare breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone to keep up with the likes of us is
impressive.
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm like, OK, 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's late for us, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's already been rocking for an hour.
Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's like I do my cold
plunge in the morning and I get ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it religiously every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cold plunge is a game changer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't drink coffee first thing in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I'm more productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you know, and it's so interesting
to talk about different strokes for
[SPEAKER_03]: different folks because I have something
called cyclic vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my triggers is cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would put me in the hospital if I
did a cold plunge in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would not be a good day for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cold plunge is so interesting
because I feel like I know the science is
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just personally can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I looked at the water,
I was like, that is going to kill me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way I'm going to go in there
and be okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you stay in there long enough,
it will, hypothermia, but not what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do 15 minute plunges sometimes and I
go, they say three to six minutes and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed it to 15 because I'm like,
this guy Rick Rubin, he does 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Rogan, he does 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't feel like I get more benefit
from doing 15 minutes than I do from doing
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I sit around eight minutes and it's
45 degrees right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing colder and now I settle
around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel really good afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found your sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's body chemistry is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's no one specific
cultivar that works for everybody across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think cannabis in general,
like in generally speaking, works for
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much everybody, but there are
nuances to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain people like stuff that's
sedative and some people like stimulants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would also add the method of
ingestion matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you consume it really affects your
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that's really,
I think, under discussed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of localities and states
that are afraid of smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're afraid even of vapor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've outlawed any type of combustion
and they drive everyone towards edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a whole nother issue with
edibles that folks don't seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand when your liver metabolizes
versus your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you can be more like tripping on
acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear the funnest or funniest stories
of people thinking they're melting or
[SPEAKER_03]: dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always go back to the cop that called
9-1-1, telling them that if you had taken
[SPEAKER_03]: our class, you'd have known better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that it truly is metabolized.
[SPEAKER_03]: 11-hydroxy-THC is more psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really, it can melt you in that
same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stronger than LSD in a lot of ways,
like for me personally, and not everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and back in the day, we didn't
really measure what we were taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't like milligrams and we were
like, okay, we're going to put this much
[SPEAKER_01]: in this amount of butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's also, I dare say how we bred
CBD out of so many varietals is because
[SPEAKER_03]: folks were passing around how high was the
measure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was, you know, they basically
throw it away to patients and patients are
[SPEAKER_03]: like, holy shit, this is really helping
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until around 2007 when we
finally started testing for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: that it was like, oh, oh, there's this
whole other thing going on here that no
[SPEAKER_03]: one understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these were still underground labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then Reggie Gardino,
he's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote the form for my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he kind of paved the way for some of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's really interesting testing
and also the market and we're still an
[SPEAKER_01]: uneducated market in the whole of the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like, we're still focused on
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still focused on look, you know,
I'm excited for the day where we can sell
[SPEAKER_01]: you the joint, the pre-roll where it's all
pre-roll driven, like brands are pre-roll
[SPEAKER_01]: driven where you don't even need to look
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it taste great?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two important things in my
opinion, because some of the best stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that gets overlooked, it's not
aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of my favorite things over the years
have been absolutely the ugliest strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's talk about aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shall we?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to jump on this bandwagon,
especially before we turn this on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said not a lot of women join the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a few different things
going on with looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the problem is just North
American bias.
[SPEAKER_03]: That what we are accustomed to,
at least what we're accustomed to saying
[SPEAKER_03]: looks good and is worth money,
is generally what we're accustomed to
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing from NorCal and those tight nugs in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that has to do with, you know,
where it was grown on the earth,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're in Northern latitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then folks go, oh, well, I was in the
islands and it was all stringy and ugly,
[SPEAKER_03]: but wow, I smoked nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, that's cause it's great
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't look like what you're
expecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this, the same concept around
like body image that you had to be stick
[SPEAKER_03]: thin, white, tall, skinny to be beautiful
for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's like, you got booty,
that is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was always beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what aesthetic are you putting
forward and what is most familiar?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you seeing on the magazines?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you seeing out there as held up
as beautiful?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's just continuing to have
the conversations like you are about what
[SPEAKER_03]: makes quality, what makes the best
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all about defining quality and
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like Instagram hasn't really been
helpful in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: When is Instagram ever helpful?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's so difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a love hate relationship with
Instagram and it's been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hit and run driver at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and especially for cannabis and for
flower, you see the stuff that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing and most of the stuff that looks
really amazing and especially the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's super high THC doesn't necessarily
taste the best or give you the best effect
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody has their opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people were chasing the high and they
want to get as high as possible and flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to be high and that's okay
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but ironically when you blind taste
test, the highest THC is not usually the
[SPEAKER_03]: winner of what makes people feel the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's not always the strongest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpenes, flavonoids, what's the new term
for abstract tech?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just put out some white papers,
I think six white papers about basically
[SPEAKER_01]: Thiles and really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think we've known about Thiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known about Thiles since 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been reading about them and their
importance and that's what gives you the
[SPEAKER_01]: gas and the skunk and some of the
offensive smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like offensive smelling weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like cilantro, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either soap or delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a cilantro guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like licking a gas tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, burnt tire, latex gloves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that chem smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you give me any haze and I will
follow you to the ends of the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bring that back to humans,
part of what we've always taught,
[SPEAKER_03]: your nose knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's remarkable is when we break
down the science and then start to
[SPEAKER_03]: correlate that to the effects on what are
your symptoms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even what's the disease, which is what
are you suffering from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we start to take a look at different
things and the doctors that have now
[SPEAKER_03]: collected hundreds and thousands of
testimonials are starting to also see
[SPEAKER_03]: those correlations where their nose knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is what is actually helping them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes back to maybe why it became
about the numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We no longer have apothecary style.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nearly obsolete.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can no longer go in and sniff before
you buy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're not even allowed to package
in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all you can say is the label.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do you have to look at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the one thing you're familiar with,
what's the THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: How high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the brand name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're definitely paying for the
brand name in a lot of the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it consistency?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard state by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the thing is, is what's going to
happen in a more mature market is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to start trusting brands that we
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go buy from one company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy their brand three or four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a product you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to trust that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to tell other people about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next time you go in, as long as it
maintains the quality that you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the future of the industry,
too, like the trusted brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think there's been a lot of
brands where they're associated with a
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrity or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Influencer driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as it's paired with a good
product, because you have one time with a
[SPEAKER_01]: customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, I'm not going to name any
celebrity brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these guys put out really shit
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they learn their lesson
because you get your customer to buy it
[SPEAKER_01]: once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you have this big surge in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not going to buy the product
again if it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially not for the price you're
charging for your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is after taxes,
people paying $65 for an eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, if you're a real smoker,
an eighth doesn't go very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that doesn't fill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an eighth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are those are 3.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just eyeballing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like I prefer the eighth size
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have really good flour,
you smoke it down to the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put that out five or six times
and it's still going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my determining factor,
especially now when I give flour out to my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends because we're trying new
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's because it puts everybody on the
same playing field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you do that, you get honest
feedback from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's the feedback that I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead, you know, you get one guy who
has a bong and one guy who has a joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: one guy who does this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has a glass pipe and it's dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what you're going to get as
far as feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like it's a truer way to get
honest feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and it's also one of the safer ways
to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, depending on how you feel about
germs, if you're sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, that for you alone.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Puff Puff Pass has become
questionable at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably always was.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just a lot more conscientious.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we used to get the cup cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd go to Amsterdam and come back with
the cup cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean used to?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, everyone just came back from MJ
BizCon and they're all telling me how sick
[SPEAKER_03]: they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need more cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like stressing your body out is,
you know, it's good for your immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes some D3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: D3 is a great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a lot of D3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also have Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been, so Angela also has Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've cured my Crohn's through
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those two pieces of the
determining factor, I was on biologics
[SPEAKER_01]: where I had to get injected with the drug
every two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get an infusion in my blood and
I'm off that for, it'll be a year next
[SPEAKER_01]: week, which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wonderful to just find homeostasis in
your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And balance and yeah, it's, it's,
it's all those things are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about Oxford and what,
what are you guys been up to lately?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: What haven't we been up to lately?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so proud of my team.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is just, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I begin?
[SPEAKER_03]: We just graduated a cohort in the state of
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were hired by the state of
Connecticut social equity council a year
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, and we got to work actually a year
and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a cohort go through a full
blown accelerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the first time a state has
truly invested in from beginning to end
[SPEAKER_03]: soup to nuts, what an operator needs to be
a startup in the fact that we were given
[SPEAKER_03]: the time with each participant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got all the way through from teaching
the business of cannabis and the supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we went into an entrepreneurial
coaching program where we had
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals work with them to build
business plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we worked with Arcview.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like having the shark tank
coach before you go pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we brought a bunch of investors
together in Connecticut and had our
[SPEAKER_03]: graduates pitch to real live investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, on the way here, I just got
notice that one of our participants just
[SPEAKER_03]: got funded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like Sol Marie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so proud of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over the moon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the, the opportunity to see them grow
and thrive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially, you know, we had both a
hundred percent owners where they were on
[SPEAKER_03]: their own solo making it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had some that were partnered with
MSOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got the chance to speak with one of
the MSO partners who just described the
[SPEAKER_03]: change in that participant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, they were quiet in the
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had nothing to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time they were done with this
accelerator, they were a true partner in
[SPEAKER_03]: the business and not that second class
partner that so many social equity
[SPEAKER_03]: participants are relegated to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And true change is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you hear success stories like that,
it's just, you know, and they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, there's a lot of success
stories and you know, it's a tough time in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people need to hear those kinds of
success stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me be your head of hope, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, yes, I have many.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and we were recently hired by the New
Jersey economic development authority to
[SPEAKER_03]: do not quite as grand program,
but to, to definitely help launch some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the participants that are getting a grant
from the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working with the city of Los
Angeles for over three years now,
[SPEAKER_03]: working with the social equity
participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down there in the city of Oakland,
Palm Springs, Monterey County,
[SPEAKER_03]: the growers out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of really phenomenal
growers that are managing to get permanent
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So helping legacy secure their space and
in the new industry is also really
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the shoulders we stand on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's like they, the people that
help build the industry, the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve a place here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I, I can't talk about it enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, and coming from the
legacy market and coming from the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional side of things, you know,
it's like, it's changed so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last, the, the landscape has
changed so much and the barrier for entry
[SPEAKER_01]: has changed so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about New Jersey and that's a,
that's a tough nut to crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get into that industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's way harder than New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really limited the licenses and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think limiting the licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is good to a degree, but it's like,
depending on how far you limit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I have mixed feelings about
New Jersey, but I think New York is really
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive and we're all learning from
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Oregon, they, they overdid it and
they allowed too many licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's gotta be a fine balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not an expert on the
subject, but I just, I have some experts
[SPEAKER_03]: on that subject and there's a,
yeah, there's, there's, there's really,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's fascinating arguments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is, you know,
go-go gadget federalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the 10th amendment at,
at, at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I'm actually look up the state's
act if you get the chance, because it just
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped yesterday, the state's act 2.0 to
de-schedule because right now we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about rescheduling and no,
no schedule three.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, you know, the, the, yeah,
we could go off on so many tangents,
[SPEAKER_03]: James, which way do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had Andrew D'Angelo and we've had
other guests on talking about reschedule
[SPEAKER_01]: versus de-schedule it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very anti reschedule and I am very
pro de-schedule completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get along just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even imagine trying to reschedule
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you work with the pharmaceutical
industry, maybe, yeah, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's reschedule the ones that have been
paying millions and billions to keep it
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal while they furiously study how to
make money off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's well, can we walk and chew gum at
the same time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, it needs to be pharmaceuticalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be able to utilize this in
medicine and doctors and nurses need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to call up, you know, 10 CCs of
whatever for folks that are suffering
[SPEAKER_03]: through radiation, chemotherapy,
whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely need to find ways for the
FDA, like let's legalize research and
[SPEAKER_03]: de-scheduling would do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and decriminalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other half of this is just
taking the teeth out of the criminality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point I have folks argue of,
of like, it's just a softer, gentler
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, but, but I think a lot of
people are conditioned, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had Brandon from in-house genetics and
he said it really best is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like, well, schedule three is
better than schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, is it really, you know,
and he, he argued the fact and he agrees a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's, it's not,
and there's a lot of people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, well, it's not schedule one,
but that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think it's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we understand the
ramifications of USDA and FDA and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the, the folks mucking around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not letting who's doing it,
keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and these are all difficult
conversations and things that need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about openly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to have some hard
conversations about really what are we
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for out of this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and who are we supporting by
saying that schedule three is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, full disclosure,
I, I sit on a committee with, with several
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that, that have these conversations
with a law enforcement action partnership
[SPEAKER_03]: leap.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's actually on our board as well,
the executive director, Diane Goldstein.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and we also Americans for prosperity
reason, there are several groups that have
[SPEAKER_03]: these conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we can go back to the
pharmaceuticalization of, of the various
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal aspects and research,
but we need to start from a de-schedule
[SPEAKER_03]: footing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be removed from the drug
enforcement agency and the control
[SPEAKER_03]: substances act first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't fault the folks that are
willing to settle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not willing to take that
trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not willing to trust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, through, through actions and a stack
of evidence, we have a lot of reason not
[SPEAKER_01]: to trust it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's why I keep mentioning the
states act 2.0 is because what we also
[SPEAKER_03]: need is an alternative to point to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now to have the rescheduling
schedule three on the table with the
[SPEAKER_03]: without a what else, it just becomes a
yes, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we need is an also and,
and an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the state's act 2.0 offers the option
of de-scheduling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not going to be, you know,
a flip that a switch that flips overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about a slow painful process
that also has to happen in nearly every
[SPEAKER_03]: state or, or Commonwealth in the nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, I think Virginia didn't adopt
the failed federal policy schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else has a lot of work to do a
state by state as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, it's not going to happen
overnight, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing good ever does.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not, that's worth it.
Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a step back and talk about
Oakster Dam University and how you got
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with Oakster Dam and where the
start came about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the, the area named Oakster Dam,
Oakland and Amsterdam was really founded
[SPEAKER_03]: by my husband, Jeff Jones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was the first to work with the city
of Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was permitted and, and helped dispense
medical cannabis to the necessity patients
[SPEAKER_03]: back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually started before the law was
passed and worked, you know, he sat at the
[SPEAKER_03]: feet of Dennis Perrone and learned many
things and decided to go the route of a,
[SPEAKER_03]: a medical cannabis dispensary versus a
club that he really wanted to take on the
[SPEAKER_03]: mantle that would be adoptable in South
Dakota where he was from and where he lost
[SPEAKER_03]: his dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was frustrated by the Clinton
administration, wound up winning in the
[SPEAKER_03]: ninth circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a picture of him handing a legal
bag of cannabis to a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was legal for about six weeks before
the stay that took him to the Supreme
[SPEAKER_03]: court and the battle that that took over
his life.
[SPEAKER_03]: His grower, who he had moved out from
Texas named Richard Lee, went ahead and
[SPEAKER_03]: picked up the permit and picked up the
mantle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Richard who founded Oakster Dam
university in 2007.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I was a fly on the wall, just starting
to date Mr. Jones, falling in love with
[SPEAKER_03]: both of them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Oakster Dam concept of a school,
because I come from a corporate training
[SPEAKER_03]: background and, and just a vocational
adult learning, helping people be the best
[SPEAKER_03]: of them that they can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, the school I, when I first
started, I came in working with doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I immediately looked for, well,
where's the education?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean there isn't any?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only educators I found were,
well, they all worked with Jeff because he
[SPEAKER_03]: was the one that was trying to teach
patients how to be safe and responsible,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to find medicine and while he couldn't
dispense it himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started volunteering.
[SPEAKER_03]: I showed up to the first class in LA to
help make coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, just the fly on the wall,
I was obsessed with the concept of
[SPEAKER_03]: training.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because I worked with doctors,
I would have been the bridge to aiding and
[SPEAKER_03]: abetting a felony.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I couldn't, yeah, I couldn't like put
my name on anything because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: representing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctor though, that was supposed to
teach that day got lost in Compton and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, he was fine, but the long and short
of it was they didn't have a teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the facilitator ran up and said,
Hey, do you think you work with patients?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you could cover this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at it and it was almost
verbatim.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I talked to patients and doctors
about, I'm like, sure, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never missed a class.
[SPEAKER_03]: Replaced myself at the doctor's office and
became a chancellor of LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually I got involved with a
campaign that I accidentally became the
[SPEAKER_03]: spokeswoman of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that because I kept thinking I was
going to go back to corporate America.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't ready to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just behind the scenes, you know,
prodding everybody else to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was nobody else to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Richard decided to put his money
where his mouth was and pay for the first
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization campaign in 30 years,
the first elected official that was
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to show up was suffering from his
chemo treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, the voter initiative would
have been dead on arrival.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I said, well, do we have what he
was going to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of this is print media anyway,
just read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, OK, read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as they shoved me from behind in front
of a bank of cameras for my first full
[SPEAKER_03]: blown press conference, suddenly I was the
spokeswoman for the Prop 19 campaign.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I became the legislative liaison
and the community liaison because we were
[SPEAKER_03]: just a small ragtag group of rebels just
trying to make a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly we were winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then then the next thing we know,
everyone's you know, they start taking you
[SPEAKER_03]: seriously when you're at, you know,
54 percent in the polls.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got not one, but two October
surprises.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the governor Schwarzenegger signed
the well, it was vetoed four times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the largest decriminalization
measure in history for California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the result of that was eighty seven
percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: James, that's nine out of ten people that
didn't go to jail the very next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we pressured him into signing that
decrim measure here in California and more
[SPEAKER_03]: effective than any other state that just
legalized because they only legalized for
[SPEAKER_03]: twenty one and up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We decriminalized for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was the biggest win.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second was just sparking the
conversation, the debate internationally,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we were the only thing to talk
about in 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we had every living DEA,
every living drug czar and the president
[SPEAKER_03]: of the no on campaign was our our former
senator, Dianne Feinstein, and our current
[SPEAKER_03]: vice president, Kamala Harris,
wrote the ballot argument against us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, these are the good old days,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we really did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our coalition of NAACP and unions and
doctors and environmentalists and yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: legacy people went on to change the law in
a lot of these other states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I cannot say enough about our students
who are it's not the secret to our
[SPEAKER_03]: success.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shout it from the rooftops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are behind the success of so much
change because we taught them advocacy and
[SPEAKER_03]: it was them that went out to their neck of
the woods and changed the law from city
[SPEAKER_03]: council to state to nation, whether it's
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing changes in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I get emails from my students.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, my.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really have changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pioneering education and then,
you know, the influence from all the
[SPEAKER_01]: students that have come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you guys were kind of the
gateway to the industry for a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were willing to let the cameras in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look back just how bananas like,
oh, the stories I can tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But letting the cameras in, I think was
really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also just seeing a dude in a
wheelchair and a pregnant redhead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like that's oh, that's not that
scary drug dealer in the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, people make fun of Cheech
and Chong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm certainly guilty of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having met Tommy several times now,
I realize how intentional he was to always
[SPEAKER_03]: portray cannabis and positive light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that he was an intelligent and
brilliant writer and comic, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand the intentionality of like,
yeah, it was dumb fun, but it was never
[SPEAKER_03]: evil or scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always fun and uplifting and funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only folks that were willing to
come out were the ones that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: your mama didn't want you to grow up to be
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it wasn't that, you know,
cannabis made you stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just stupid people enjoy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were the ones willing to talk
about it and get busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fearless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so are we stupid or crazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really took folks that just like
look like middle America, that we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just to normalize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And de-stigmatize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny how normalized it's become.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has a long ways to go in some
regards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like Sanjay Gupta did a lot
when he went on 60 minutes and said that
[SPEAKER_01]: kids that have seizures have now been
cured from their seizures or they've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot less seizures from CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an amazing example of evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also, by the way, came out against Prop
19.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, little Charlotte Fiji was
changed his life and ours across the board
[SPEAKER_03]: because it really illustrated,
you know, you can't ignore these videos of
[SPEAKER_03]: babies seizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't even talk about her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really and dying that are they are
they seizing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they learning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanjay Gupta and the ability to have that
conversation on CNN, the ability,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I didn't tell my friends at the
time, but the ability to go talk about it
[SPEAKER_03]: on Fox all the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that's half of America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've got Stuart Varney talking
about the money, then we're also
[SPEAKER_03]: capturing, you know, Wall Street,
not just K Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've already convinced, I think,
Main Street in most places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanjay Gupta, he was our Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the voice for all of us in some
regards, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like telling my parents all these
years that cannabis isn't bad and them
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of arguing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think after seeing that,
they completely changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that one 60 minute episode,
like literally an hour changed lives of so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people because you can't argue when
you have kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like you can't argue that
people need, you know, they should have
[SPEAKER_01]: the right as long as it's not hurting them
to do whatever they want to make them
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how brave are Charlotte's parents?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she also passed in 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Her parents, you know, risk losing her.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a threat still everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even here in California, people are still
losing their children over cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still splitting up families.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really it's sick that you could do
that or that you have to go to some other
[SPEAKER_01]: state to save the life of your kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you are a medical refugee.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not even going to get abortions or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother shitty conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like these laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have my own opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people that watch the show,
you have an opinion and there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like when it comes to your kids,
especially like I don't understand how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and for our pro-life friends,
I have the argument that if you are
[SPEAKER_03]: pro-life, then you had better be
pro-cannabis because pro-cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: pro-life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the rest of us, yes, we just hope
to have the freedom if we need medical
[SPEAKER_03]: attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the conversation across the
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the freedom to be able to protect
yourself with the Second Amendment,
[SPEAKER_03]: which also has been stripped from cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's just about every
amendment in the first 10 have been
[SPEAKER_03]: subjugated by the war on drugs,
by prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these are these are largely
the people we serve.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've we've always taught it's I can't
even believe some of the the titans of the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, but the the ones that I choose
to talk about most often tend to be those
[SPEAKER_03]: that were justice involved, that did spend
time in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the King of Weed on Haight
Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's always been the King of
Weed on Haight Street for like 30 years
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sean Richard has has has been there
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he's the legal King of Weed on Haight
Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get the asterisk at Oakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's fallen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people are paying him just to be
on their boards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's his experience is far beyond
legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: His experience now is in the boardroom and
not just the courtroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's he's really, you know,
and it's there's so many firsts that have
[SPEAKER_03]: come through and that are yet to come
because there are states that aren't there
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are businesses yet to be founded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's you know, there's this is the
argument for maybe free market is there's
[SPEAKER_03]: yokels that should get the hell out,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the free market pushes out often those
that are less than I just had a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation with someone from Oregon
saying it rocks because the you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the losers get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can having that low barrier
to entry is one of the best equalizers out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you look to Oklahoma and it's,
you know, just organically more equitable
[SPEAKER_03]: because there are no barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, are they all good operators?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there should be standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be training.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be more better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mo better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mo better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in Oregon, it's a perfect example,
but it's so competitive in Oregon and the
[SPEAKER_01]: price is so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then nobody wants to pay the higher
price for the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't say nobody because,
you know, you've got the folks that just
[SPEAKER_03]: want to show how much they've paid for a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about the quality is at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't really I shouldn't say
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think cost is important for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it's about an experience a lot
of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll pay something more for a special
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not smoke that all the time,
but I'm all about I'm chasing that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's guys chasing the dragon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get as high as they can
flavor chasers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I chase the flavor, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like I'm chasing that
experience and I'm trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always try to find something new is and
that kind of goes along with breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like we're looking for that
new gem, something that's slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different or completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to find something that's
completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me some, you know, some green tea
flavor or some red bean ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can like a true Fino Hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was looking for weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what have you seen as far as like
as far as new genetics and new flavors?
[SPEAKER_01]: You you love sativa's and you love that
stimulant for it for the effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's I'll just say I trust my nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I I am awful with these
conversations because I married a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so whenever folks ask me, like,
what's my favorite Mr. Jones finest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever he's doing is where he's
got right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, after years of looking,
he found a haze and we just have a small
[SPEAKER_03]: garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not, you know, this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which everybody should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is, you know, next to the
tomatoes in the basil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got chickens, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get the yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the yeah, it's it just takes so damn
long that you can't find it on the market
[SPEAKER_03]: is the problem because the super silver
haze, it's if you can turn over this many
[SPEAKER_03]: crops in a year versus this many crops in
a year, you know, it's it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: three to five is a huge difference on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to pull the money out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight and a half weeks super silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk to Jeff about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: More time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a short flowering super silver
week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross bread with with a good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a short flowering version.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's you know, and then there's all
kinds of stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some really good hazes
that are across with an auto flower or was
[SPEAKER_03]: it is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so and then people have gone
through a lot of things to find stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's crossed with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you guys can check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might even have some flower here for you
to check out later to take home with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've been getting into the
sativas to as far as like the PIF going
[SPEAKER_01]: back to some classics, though,
like the PIF in the Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been enjoying those quite a bit
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I enjoy a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like some stuff to wake me up and I
like some stuff to make me tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always looking for something
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we enjoy salads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's also the bigger reason that
I struggle on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's my favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we we like to blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a better experience overall over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's the good news is,
is he is so good at what he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he is your horticulture faculty,
not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, well, we have several.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joey Aronieta has been just worldwide at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The folks that started, you know,
just coming into our classroom and
[SPEAKER_03]: teaching people how to grow are now
masters of the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's a repetition thing to like
learning how to grow and fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, am I allowed to curse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too late for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can totally curse on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate cursing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think and that goes for
everything in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should fuck it up a bunch like figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to fuck it up and then get back
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really learn who you are in the grow
room, outside the grow room by making
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've made plenty of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made mistakes my whole life and learn
from them, especially growing and making
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like I've made seeds where
I didn't have pollen ready and my
[SPEAKER_01]: reversals didn't work and screwed up
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and what I try to share,
you know, with my kids, with my class is
[SPEAKER_03]: just, you know, try not to make the same
mistake over to make new, fresh mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a chef, I would allow people to make
mistakes one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you make the mistake one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you can make different mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the learning process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with cannabis and with
cultivation, it's really good to make
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes, because if you never make
mistakes, you never learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way to learn is to screw
stuff up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making room for that is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming from hospitality and working
with a multitude of chefs, I know you now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the whole chef mentality and
it's like get the job done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have your stuff in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in its place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's super important to be
prepared, whether it's scheduling
[SPEAKER_01]: scheduling is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, do you have all those things on
hand that you're going to need today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have to go three times to the
grocery shop to get what you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's all proper planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you start applying those things to
life, your life is going to become much
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I've gotten in the habit of of like
asking each day when I'm looking at my
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule and what I'm doing, am I moving
myself closer to my goals or further away?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because it is really what you do
that cumulatively turns out is your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those little choices really add up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you do throughout the day is what
you do all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like everything is so repetition
based, I think, for most of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lazy part of the time,
you're lazy all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then how do you also break out of your
own?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as much as repetition is vital,
how do you also break out of your own
[SPEAKER_03]: habits?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I talk about to do this every
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This industry is hard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at capital H, it is so difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets harder every day for new and
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even just what's going to happen next
week with with the Fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just every.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's so tumultuous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to both enjoy change,
take it as you stress versus distress and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, be able to stay dynamic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I try to like, how do you get out of
bed every day and keep it not not just on
[SPEAKER_03]: the days you feel inspired days you don't?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got a little secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a put one foot in front of the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and that's it's tenacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's doing stuff on the days that
you don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what will kind of define you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, what I what I tell people is
that I I don't only get up that day,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I get up at four in the morning that
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is your competition doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to do it exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just it's a lot about
discipline, but it's like doing stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like cold plunges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really go into bed at eight and
going to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I went to bed at eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I go to bed at eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just get cranky after eight because I
get up at four.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, and we need our sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I I appreciate sleep a
lot more than I used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and it's what is in your control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I finally realized a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was actually Arianna
Huffington that made it OK to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I used to pride myself on
how much work and how little sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I realized, like, at a certain
point, never mind having a family and
[SPEAKER_03]: needing to find some tradeoffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But are you putting yourself in an early
grip?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for whom?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to build a fucking statue?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the one thing I can control is how I
eat and if I sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, I try to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all need different amounts of
sleep, I think, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sleep is super important and quality
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep is more important than sleep,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they say?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only at 70 percent if you don't get
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just walk around a dumbass all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be an idiot or an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I try to get enough sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let that be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't smoke too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to smoke right before I go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I just discovered?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to out myself right now because,
you know, I've been I taught the damn
[SPEAKER_03]: science class like this methods of
ingestion is my jam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the science of cannabis and why this
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could never consume edibles like I
would.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it could be, you know, Saturday
morning, ready to go and just I'm ready
[SPEAKER_03]: for a nap if if you even like wave a
edible under my nose kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet I suffer from insomnia of the
worst degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just finally figured out edibles for
sleeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like two and a half milligrams?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little itty bitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like whatever edible, whatever little
gummy it takes me like five days of I just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of know a little itty bitty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I was having too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew how I learned it was Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Delta 8 when I was because I go through
insomnia abouts and I'm sleeping really
[SPEAKER_01]: well right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it's like exercise,
cold plunge, all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I don't sleep as much as I
probably should.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sleep really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I sleep, I sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I am going to take a sleeping pill,
I was taking Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, Delta 8 is just 20 percent
strength of Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just take less Delta 9 and you
get the same effect.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that it's but it's,
you know, shake it up a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try stuff you haven't tried in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's experimenting and knowing your
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I think a lot of people
rely on doctors to tell them what they
[SPEAKER_01]: need when I think doctors should be able
to guide you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not taught in medical school.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even teach about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think but but like knowing your
body, the only one who's going to know
[SPEAKER_01]: your body is that you can rely on doctors
for stuff, but you should know your body
[SPEAKER_01]: better than any doctor and what you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is truly the difficulty, I think,
with cannabinoids and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, it's not water soluble and all
the easy drugs are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that it's it's hydrophobic is
not helpful for really anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to like burn it to test it in a
lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: How hard it is to work with, you know,
and equipment gets sticky, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's it's not friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way, you know, say the bark of a
willow tree is which, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: fun fact, women used to get burned at the
stake over and now it's aspirin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the the fact that it's so hard to to
work with, number one, but number two,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it affects each of us differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think of a pendulum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, each each of us,
our pendulum swings differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much sleep did you get?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much coffee did you drink?
[SPEAKER_03]: Water exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did your spouse or partner just piss you
off?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, you know, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the cherries just pop in your rear
view?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all of these things can affect
your state of mind and how cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: affects you from day to day, hour to hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same dose or whatever it is you're
consuming can affect you differently,
[SPEAKER_03]: even from Thursday to Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for for for you to find
homeostasis, for you to find that center
[SPEAKER_03]: of your own swinging pendulum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's really we we've always focused
on just teaching titration and moderation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're you're also just wasting
your money if you're smoking too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Save it for the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, just, you know, taking unless
you are the type of medical patient where
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, you know, if you have MS or
Parkinson's, where you really can't
[SPEAKER_03]: function without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're someone who is just,
you know, consuming commonly as much for
[SPEAKER_03]: adult use as for medicine, just even
taking a break every once in a while and
[SPEAKER_03]: listening to your own body because
cannabis is so effective across different
[SPEAKER_03]: symptoms and systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry for just a delay of diagnosis,
that something that is wrong with you is
[SPEAKER_03]: being treated by cannabis, but not cured.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are you ignoring?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the only doctor you go to is your
pot doc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why good pot docs at least
touch you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they take your pulse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look for these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Frank Lucido.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a giant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He taught for us years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been seeing Frank since 2000,
I think, maybe 99.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll introduce you to Dr. Talleyrand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he'll pick you up as a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank Lucido.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's quite quite the character and a
really, really great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good luck in your retirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers to Dr. Lucido.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, he was such a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote a recommendation for cannabis
for my friend's younger brother,
[SPEAKER_01]: who was 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was willing to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was willing to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the only one willing to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nobody else that would do
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was quite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is back in 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninety eight, maybe, actually,
when he wrote that he was very brave.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was it was Dr. Todd McArea,
who passed away in 2007, that was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, helped found the Medical
Cannabis Association, who helped push for
[SPEAKER_03]: that early testing that finally helped us
realize that, I mean, it's like the Amazon
[SPEAKER_03]: rainforest in this in this one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's just chase the varietals and
and try to say we don't even know what we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just unconsciously unskilled about
all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so exciting is what
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got guys like Daddy Mary in Israel,
which he's really, you know, he's paved
[SPEAKER_01]: the way for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we got front range
biosciences and we've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal genetic genomics and guys really
going on the genetic side, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they're doing over in Israel is
really impressive because there's way less
[SPEAKER_01]: red tape so they can do actual testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've legalized research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're getting there and we're going
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way we're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just blows my mind that we're not there
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have to keep demanding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, which and you know, it's hard
because Biden, he is not our biggest fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, you know, it's what's so
silly because I mean, I know whose fan he
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a fan of and it's not us.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, things change and we
evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is like the younger
generation is so much more educated about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and so many more people have
tried cannabis and people it's normalized
[SPEAKER_01]: to the younger generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time, things will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why education is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because good Lord, our children will
inherit the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the the fear, the stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: For so long in California, we're trying to
convince people that the sky will not fall
[SPEAKER_03]: chicken little like cats won't sleep with
dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they do, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nothing bad happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything's going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and marijuana madness,
I dare say, is one of the most effective
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing campaigns ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and the most believed it and and the
most false.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's hard to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was a dare kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually went in and taught Nancy
Reagan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, one of our graduates was one of
Hassan Rashad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the little black kids that
she grabbed to go stand next to her to
[SPEAKER_03]: just say no to drugs on the on the
national stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's an Osterdam graduate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I remember the commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your brain and this is your brain
on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crack sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, you know, getting getting over
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know, I have young people
walk up to me and they're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've wanted to do this my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How old are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do the math.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I'm old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but it is their whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is their whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's yeah, Irish.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't remember when it was more
dangerous to get caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's and so many, you know, just don't
don't understand and don't appreciate and
[SPEAKER_03]: how lucky that they don't have to think
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with that, though,
is we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're still ripping babies from their
mother's breasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still arresting 17 year old Hispanic
kids because that's who's getting pulled
[SPEAKER_03]: over is black and brown and indigenous.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter where you live, that they're
still more likely to get shaken down for
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is and go to jail now because
they're underage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we really need to take the teeth
out of the criminality so that because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the cops that I've met in the
field by and large, you know, the frothing
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibitionists are the lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that represent the police
officers associations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most cops on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a good laugh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask them about the last marijuana bust
that they were scared for their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're that is not their
biggest concern out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a tool in their toolbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, if you take this tool out,
I'll simply use another tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to know where the damn line is
and tell me what what matters to you
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we change that line,
you know, that our cops here in California
[SPEAKER_03]: are still being taught police officer
standardized training post training is
[SPEAKER_03]: still the training of the 90s that we're
all a bunch of just druggie drug addled
[SPEAKER_03]: idiots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and you should go crack some skulls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of this is just a bunch of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still being taught the old
standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we also have to demand at the same
time that we're all educating ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And good Lord, come out to your mom if you
haven't yet that you are a cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer that, you know, have the
conversation with the people that love you
[SPEAKER_03]: of why you choose this and and.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens, you know, show them your
success, not not just your your goofy
[SPEAKER_03]: side, but, you know, it's it's just
continuing the conversation and
[SPEAKER_03]: remembering that there are folks on the
right side of prohibition, but there are
[SPEAKER_03]: still folks on the wrong side of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, again, we're just we're not done
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are still people sitting in prison
as we speak on this issue more than you
[SPEAKER_03]: can possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just for nonviolent drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nonviolent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, some of the most egregious,
they were Rico cases, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't even caught with cannabis or
cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just some other criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Rich DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did 32 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He spent 32 years in prison behind bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a travesty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're leaving young children behind
and moms that are trying to raise those
[SPEAKER_03]: kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And moms are giving birth in shackles
still in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and, you know, if you've got that
great aunt Betty in Texas, give her a call
[SPEAKER_03]: about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, her governor, her legislature
need to hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if if you live in in my
district, you know, call the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: vote for it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because otherwise they only get called to
like get yelled at of what they.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are pissed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you got to come and say thank
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas is so strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Texas is so strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a conversation about
Texas now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my parents live in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people are going to piss off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you from Texas?
[SPEAKER_03]: I should ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: That first.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't piss off the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents live in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our founder lives in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of students in Texas is like
starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're OK with CBD now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have stores that sell THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we replace the attorney general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we agree on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a rough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to go for the governor,
but let's just start with the attorney
[SPEAKER_03]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think the people are
starting to demand change and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, we got Austin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of Californians going out
there to Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm hoping is to change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like changing the landscape out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Register to vote, friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like Texas for what Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stuff in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I'll wrap this back to the
beginning of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'll do that for you, which is,
you know, the Christian conservative
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Richard's mom and Lee founded Ramp
Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she is showing up to CPAC over the
years and having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
Rep Boner is now repping cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's there's a lot of
change that comes from both sides of the
[SPEAKER_03]: aisle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of the things that we can
all agree on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can sit around that campfire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably won't sing Kumbaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on where you live, it's the Dems
that are standing in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this isn't a red or blue
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, it's an American issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an American issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we as Americans should be addressing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter what side you're on,
left or right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it just needs to be
addressed by all of us and at least
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of thoroughly by all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if because if you really think
about it, you'll understand that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And legalization is the best thing for all
of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of folks say, James, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my top 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't it's I've got so many other things
to worry about.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what is in your top 10?
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's talk about how marijuana
prohibition has fucked that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is it your kids?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it your schools?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now we're more interested in
putting people in jail still than in
[SPEAKER_03]: school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where are all these resources
going?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are the cops focused on?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there we have rape kits that
have sat on shelves for over a decade
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're so focused on testing that
green shit in that little bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: finding out whether or not it's what
something that's never killed anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: except for one recently that and that I
think is more of a workforce issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was asthma related.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to acknowledge her death
because it was attributed officially to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, at the end of the day,
it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to say it takes it takes about a
ton to to kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Falling from about 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I've tried it just.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say if you smoke five pounds or 10
pounds in five minutes, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like smoke the telephone pole outside
and under five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not even the cannabis that kills
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the CO2 poisoning and the lack of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't eat enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll split your gut before the cannabis
itself can kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and it is a conversation to
have is we are moving so much of this into
[SPEAKER_03]: labs, especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: To just like subjugate the law,
you know, that we we've been contorting
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may feel like you want to die from
overconsumption, but it is not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we but there there there are now and
and, you know, I'm not I'm not here to be
[SPEAKER_03]: an alarmist, but but there are these are
new constituents that are being created
[SPEAKER_03]: and we don't fully understand the safety
profile or how long it stays in the
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we just have to understand like
what you are doing in the lab to convert
[SPEAKER_03]: Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what what magic are you doing behind
the scenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, a lot of the stuff it's
not, you know, vaporizing is one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: healthiest ways to consume cannabis,
but not if they're adding vitamin E
[SPEAKER_03]: acetate to make it more viscous and give
you a bigger puff of smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we adding?
[SPEAKER_03]: How cheap is that metal that you're
heating up and sucking in mainlining to
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Delta bad for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably not if you're using good
starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we're talking about an enzyme
using enzymes as a pathway to convert it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and we know as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is I think a larger issue is is
that because cannabis and hemp same plant
[SPEAKER_03]: are bioaccumulators, that a lot of folks
are buying what they can find,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is industrial hemp, which is not fit
for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's a bioaccumulator,
where was that grown?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was grown in China or Russia,
because we were the number one importers
[SPEAKER_03]: for from Russia up until recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And China, as a matter of fact,
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and what has that grown in?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of heavy metals, radioactivity,
Chernobyl?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the good news of that is reclamation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've had students come in from
Japan after Fukushima having whole
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations about how hemp can help
reclimate that soil because it can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is what I think is like the
biggest travesty of like, wow,
[SPEAKER_03]: aside from prohibition, this is what we
really got wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have we we've whiffed on the benefits
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was this brief moment where
there was a gold rush towards hemp,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they forgot, oh, sure, we got to
process it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh, we need a market to sell it to
like, oops, you know, we forgot to build
[SPEAKER_03]: out the full supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meanwhile, all of the
opportunities for fiber and fuel and
[SPEAKER_03]: building materials and all everybody wants
to do is go convert Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's all that matters is let's go
compete with the legal cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And meanwhile, the legal cannabis market
is struggling under all these birth that
[SPEAKER_03]: the taxes and and the burdens and the
economy is selling the same shit at Circle
[SPEAKER_03]: K.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's so many uses for
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hemp Crete bioremediation,
soil remediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the largest just growing in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the largest carbon sink crop we can
plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just apply it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, Johnny Appleseed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll spread it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the helicopter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you in South Dakota.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, Christy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I saw something on a Indian
reservation that's got funded for hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Crete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're going to be doing hemp
Crete which I think is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so exciting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start to really study with
building materials and what that can do to
[SPEAKER_03]: to start to offset carbon, which is all we
keep talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the longer it sits there, the more
carbon it continues to accumulate from
[SPEAKER_03]: what I understand as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just gets stronger over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's it's we've really got to
figure out how to unstick this stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I've got to go back to study
scheduling because I don't see again,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get incremental, but you've got to shoot
for the flipping stars to catch the moon
[SPEAKER_03]: or next door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we just keep settling for good
enough, we're never going to get to good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Settling is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, at the end of the day,
I just I hope people just keep showing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something we one of the things
I try to leave our graduates, which I call
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxtradame gladiators, they're the first
through the wall, sometimes get bloody,
[SPEAKER_03]: make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trained fighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got to advocate for yourself,
for your business, for your choice,
[SPEAKER_03]: for your freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means showing up to vote and
showing up for jury duty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get that same like, oh, damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I get the jury duty and then I
remind myself, you know, it still goes
[SPEAKER_03]: down in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in Arkansas and the
ability to get on a jury that is trying a
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana case and, you know, jury
immunity is something that a lot of us
[SPEAKER_03]: missed in civics that you're not just
judging the defendant, you're judging the
[SPEAKER_03]: very law that put him there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can hang that jury because
marijuana isn't a crime.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for
yourself, going back to the younger self
[SPEAKER_01]: that was in the industry for one year or
two years, what would that one piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: advice be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a position to have even more
conversations than I did in rooms with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I've had a lot of conversations
with powerful people, but I've also been
[SPEAKER_03]: in rooms with folks that I just didn't
want to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a hard time asking for help and
having that conversation and just getting
[SPEAKER_03]: over the no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had asked more because I regret
those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't regret most of the stuff I've
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I regret those missed opportunities
because by not asking, by not talking,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never opened my mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I think just, you know,
tell your story and don't be afraid you're
[SPEAKER_03]: bothering people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still feel that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, I'm not going to bother them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even talk to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on, I'm like, damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't I just go shake their hand and
thank them for their trouble?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I would say just get over
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to get over yourself,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes it can be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now where do you see yourself in five
years with still with Oakster Dam,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing your thing with Oakster Dam?
[SPEAKER_03]: I bleed green and gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were rated in 2012 and that was by
the Obama administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I took over the school.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is legacy at this point for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started with my husband almost 30 years
ago and it came back to our family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still see myself talking to Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the opportunity to talk to
several other governments of other
[SPEAKER_03]: countries, but I still need to be on that
that floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good news about education,
James, is we're never done.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always more to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whatever the government decides to do,
there's more to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whatever state you live in,
whatever country you live in, whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: is you love about the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know genetics and growing, cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I strongly recommend that everyone plant a
seed and try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and and the development that we
are doing with the school, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they they made a movie about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's documentary out now that you can
catch in various film festivals that that
[SPEAKER_03]: really captures the the history of of the
end of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It captured legalization in the journey,
nearly nearly there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so also just making sure that folks
catch that fire, see the film,
[SPEAKER_03]: take a class and and find ways to to
better themselves, whether it's just as a
[SPEAKER_03]: patient trying to understand how this
affects them or their nephew coming out of
[SPEAKER_03]: school and looking for a new career.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think workforce development and helping
people rise in their careers, which
[SPEAKER_03]: ironically is how I started in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm doing it for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just beautiful to see and hear
the governments that I now work with
[SPEAKER_03]: spewing this same thing that I was saying
with a microphone in 2007 when people
[SPEAKER_03]: thought we were fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is amazing to to see the change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and we try to encourage people to be
lifelong learners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really just where do you want to
grow from here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the second you get rid of ego,
you realize that there is there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: mastery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's if you love it, you get up and
you do it and you learn from what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing every day and you learn from other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also ever evolving and changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is amazing that you just brought me
back to the one thing that I didn't finish
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier, which is fall in love with the
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fall in love with your solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you get stagnant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fall in love with the problem you're
trying to solve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it never gets old.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always stay at the cusp of like,
what's new?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I torque it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, shift it, go pull it,
push it, do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get up and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be solutions based.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by all means, be part of the solution,
not the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope to encourage more females on
your show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, growers love females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking for females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if somebody is looking to find you,
where can they find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they find out more about Oaksterdam
and you have Instagram or where should
[SPEAKER_01]: they go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am daleskyjones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can find me on Instagram and
well, all of the whatnots and such things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oaksterdamuniversity.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oaksterdam.com is really a hub that is
growing every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what's most exciting is
we are also evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you've ever been to Oaksterdam,
we're not who you remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come meet the new Oaksterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a beautiful afternoon from the rest
of you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
