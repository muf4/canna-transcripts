[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast, and today our special guest is
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave Perkins from Bud-A-Larrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met at Rega in the River.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we first met, you came up to me
and you said, tell me the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tell me what you think of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what is this guy talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you bust out a bag of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said, if it's not the real sour
diesel, it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tell me your opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right when you said that, I was kind
of like, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never met him before in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's saying something interesting,
because usually people give me bags of
[SPEAKER_02]: sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, dude, this is the real sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's usually this gassy version of
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I remember as sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it smells a little bit like it,
but it's a much gassier version.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I cracked your butt open,
it made me think that there's only one
[SPEAKER_02]: type of sour that I ever remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that you have is the sour wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only called sour when I first
started smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you came to me with this butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, it brought back all these
memories from the last 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's undoubtedly the real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've showed it to so many different
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked some with Jason Pinsky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these guys have also verified and are
all excited about the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I knew was special
when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew I had to do whatever it took to
keep it for as long as I felt necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've had the cut for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I got it from this guy in the
Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had been buying sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought it for the first time in 1999 out
in Kirkwood, out in Animal House.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know Kirkwood, you know the Animal
House, the employee housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn, this stuff is pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward a few years later,
was able to still get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy, one time I was at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just like, hey, you want a cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, it's the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I'll definitely take
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reached into his closet where there was
no grow light of any sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just a plant in a red cake
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took it home and here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sour is really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like my opinion of it is that
it's a Chem 91 bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of different opinions
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've done as much research as I
could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's led me to believe that not just
from the stories from other people,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the way it grows and all these other
phenotypes that are very similar,
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually test genetically different,
that lean heavy on the Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They remind me more of the Chem from Chem
91 or that Chem D than sour, but it has
[SPEAKER_02]: the same structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are all derivatives of each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like that sour has got its own
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen so many different things
that people say are sour or cuts that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen in the last, especially the last 10
years that it's like, okay, it's sour and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's not sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you also mentioned something
about probably the way it's grown can
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely make it expressed differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of truth to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I 100% think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think about my father-in-law won a
cup with a variety called the cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: slider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a grow off, but it was
back in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they got together to show,
his was totally different than everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, why is yours so
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he won that year with that cherry
slider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're like, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: In growing environment, the person,
time of year, type of grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are all things that go into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cure I know for sure is probably the
biggest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more so than the way it's grown or
who grows it, because I've had sour that
[SPEAKER_00]: is right where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can quickly disappear if you
don't store it in the right conditions or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't seal it up at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that as much of it has to go
with the cure as it does this cut of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also had people grow hermeseed or
seltz seed from one of my friend's sour
[SPEAKER_00]: batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a room full of sour, nothing else
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came back and they're like,
it's just not the same sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been pretty transparent with
people about how I grow it, what I've used
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it with a bunch of different
nutrients, a bunch of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes out different in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, oh, the sour that I've
seen is loose and airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real sour is loose and airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, I've grown loose and
airy sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also grown really tight sour
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown it inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every plant is different depending on
who you give it to and how they treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot of variation
within that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of people striving to say,
well, I got the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never really felt that need for
validation, I think, is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I have a cut called the Weasel's
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is supposedly sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not the sour that I remember from
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also an AJ's cut that we got
probably like 2005 or 2006 that was more
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was before I knew AJ and knew the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like a lot of these things
are probably bag seeds, potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you're saying about drying and
curing, I know for a fact because I used
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember there was one time where I
yielded way more than I thought I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't have the capacity to really
dry it all properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dried it too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tried to rehydrate it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I killed the smell completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it looked like sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like the most amazing sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you'd have to really squeeze it
to get in there to get the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the smoke just didn't translate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sour, you should be able to take a
joint and smoke it all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should taste like sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to put it out five
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You light it back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still tastes like sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still tastes like sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back a week later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could tell that roach was a sour
diesel roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only a handful of things I've
experienced in my whole life that are
[SPEAKER_02]: capable of doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat piss is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a handful of good herb
that'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just, compared to everything on
the market, you don't get that across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pronounced flavor in the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just like, oh, it's kind of
like it tastes like the first hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your room smells like sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: People walk into your room, and they know
that it's sour if you've been smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just something extremely
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not linear in the sense that you're
just about sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have so many different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me some bubba that was really
nostalgic as well, which I haven't seen
[SPEAKER_02]: real good bubba a lot in the last 10,
15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge in the late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the market like the traditional
market in the Bay Area, they had a fino
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like a 53-day fino, and they'd
probably harvest it on day 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just rocking it and turning
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was reminiscent of bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smoked okay, but it wasn't like the
pre-98, I guess, pre-98 bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just called it bubba kush back in the
day, but then they came out with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-98 or the name pre-98.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, tell us about the bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, it's a bubba kush crossed with
the original haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bubba kush, is from Caleb at CSI
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a 100 plant fino hunt, S1,
with his pre-98 bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he grew those out, took a few of
those finos, a few of the winners over to
[SPEAKER_00]: my father-in-law's house, Tony,
AKA Budularo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went through him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my father-in-law, Tony,
he picked out the number seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the number seven turned slightly
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had more like an OG kush kind of smell
and flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so out of all of the finos that they
had, he was like, the number seven's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He named that the bomb threat bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever hear of the bomb threat
bubba or number seven, that's what this is
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed with the original haze from Sam
the Skunk Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes kind of via some guys in Germany
that got the original haze from Sam the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk Man and then did reproductions of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they used that, the pollen from
that original haze to create this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great because it's very
reminiscent of the bubba kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a cultivator standpoint,
it grows really fast and you get a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like bubba kush on
steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to offer something that
usually has a lower yield and a slower veg
[SPEAKER_00]: process, you can put in a foot tall plant
and end up with a three foot four tall
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and get a decent yield on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because bubba is a little bit slower
to veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the biggest yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a medium yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has this amazing soap character.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the flower that you gave me has
that little bit of soapiness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really like the gas with the
soapiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what makes it special.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also love haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the land race varieties that
you're working with because you seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a good collection of land race and
pearls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think reintroducing pearls to the
world, that may be your purpose for being
[SPEAKER_02]: here on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like that's extremely special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm definitely here to grow
the sacred herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I view it as a sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all got to be able to survive and do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't lose money to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still 100% believe that you can
survive and treat the plant as a sacred
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pearls are a great example of
something that checks none of the boxes
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wins in the effect category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a Colombian-Mexican tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my father-in-law got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Charlie Garcia, a kind of
biogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a destroyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he popped the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he got one of them that spit out
pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he finished it, which he could have
gone two different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could have said, oh, there's nothing on
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to yield anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to toss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would have been that,
on to the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, he was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing for 56 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of wisdom when it comes to
watching plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not just a weed wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got knowledge and an understanding of
plants from the whole entire world,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole entire plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to travel all around the world
to get seeds of rare palms, bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a tropical palm plantation at his
house up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got all these varieties of plants
from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when he stumbled across the pearls,
he let it do its thing, 16 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: finished it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, man, this is what I've
been searching for after 56 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still smokes every day, lots of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still really loves herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, this is what the tie stick
made me feel like the first time I found
[SPEAKER_00]: tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for him, it's this lifelong quest
of smoking herb and being quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I satisfied, he went through the whole
OG craze, the chem craze, the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's grown it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he found the pearls, he was like,
this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I've been looking for my
whole entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all that I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now he's got, I think, six or seven
different phenos of the pearls that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much all he wants to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just interesting to me that he
could have thrown it away and we would
[SPEAKER_00]: have not ended up with the pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he has the wisdom and foresight to
know that just because a plant looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: crap doesn't mean that it's not going to
have this amazing effect that now a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are starting to see and recognize
and really, really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think a lot of people that we
surround ourselves with, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: you've had on your podcast and myself
included up until about a year and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: two years ago, had not felt an effect or
had an experience like this from any other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking some.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the hall of flowers last week with Dan
Herr, Jack Harrison, and he was blown
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took one hit and was just like,
I feel he basically is like, I feel so
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to stop right here and enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me too, I took that one hit and I
was just like, I want to just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to hang out right here and be
this high and be high like this because
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it feels great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's something you don't want to
get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's so hard to classify when
you start talking, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to classify Indica and Sativa
and, and, you know, broadly versus
[SPEAKER_02]: narrowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for effect, and I feel like it's
somewhere in the middle and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: handful of things that I feel like are
just their own thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to classify that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could say equatorial maybe in
structure, but then effect is just its own
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you gave me some last time we were
together, I think it canifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: The African Hayes 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: The African Hayes 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about the Indica
Sativa, you know, wide leaf, narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: is you know, you could have something that
has maybe more of a Sativa high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has a broad leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Jack Herr is a good example,
really quick flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a 56 day, you know, we'll finish
in September in Mendocino, but it has
[SPEAKER_00]: skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people say, Oh, it's got
skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Sativa, but the length of flowering
and the effect are things that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been learning a lot from my
father-in-law about just plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, you know, we don't want to box
ourselves in and say, this is this because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, is it really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the flowering time, the amount
of days it takes to flower seems for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my experience, to correlate to the type
of high that you get with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're on the 45, 50 day spectrum,
you get this very sedative feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you hit the 100, 100 plus 120,
it seems to move towards this like
[SPEAKER_00]: euphoric, soaring, uplifting type of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can call it whatever we want,
but the effect is really what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: measure of how high we get and the type of
high that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the longer flowering,
the more uplifting the highs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter flowering is that more sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that's a better place
to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than wide leaf or narrow leaf or,
you know, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and my friend Dave passed on
420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he redirected my focus back into
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like meeting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a collection, this big
collection of land-raised seeds from my
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy, Fritzie, who's been all over India.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, he's there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's collecting all kinds of stuff
from India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with the access to the genetics
that I have, it's like the possibilities
[SPEAKER_02]: are really, they start becoming endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's like, I mean, it just takes so
much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't understand the
amount of time it takes to go exploring
[SPEAKER_02]: for new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for me, part of what I need to do
is I need to make it appealing to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's stuff that I can have
that's completely just for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as far as a seed company,
I have to make it appealing to other
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like maybe my job is to figure
out how to cross it with modern genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: to where we can sneak it into people's
minds where they're like, oh, maybe it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have to be purple candy gas,
or maybe it doesn't have to be this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe I can just smoke it for the
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe we can find some happy place in
the middle where they can get a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of both to where it spawns their curiosity
to where they're like, well, if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: good, maybe I should try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I always walk around with the
super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lately, the last year, it's always been
the super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to share it with people,
especially the people that are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I don't like haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, smoke this and tell me you
think it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke it down and it has a great
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's organic living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy Chris, he grows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flora and Flame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's extremely special to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with your stuff, it's like,
I'm able to give that to the same kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: people, especially my friends who trust me
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, OK, well, I just rolled this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting their opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like it's almost our duty as
stewards to this plant to be able to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones to have the foresight to be able
to reintroduce this stuff to people that
[SPEAKER_02]: have never experienced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of people that love
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they think they love this one thing
because that's what they've experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they haven't really got to experience
the whole world of what's available with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, if you've never been to
Europe, you don't know if you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: like it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing with flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, until you've actually tried it
and you've smoked these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe White Thorn Rose is the one for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that's extremely special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's the one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe you smoke one of these new
varieties, not even new, but these land
[SPEAKER_02]: race varieties have been out forever,
but new to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you can attach yourself
with is I want to feel like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'll pull out some of the
pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also new to my father-in-law,
who's the one that is responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: these being in this box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been grown and smoking for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the fact that there's
things that we may call new, but that have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been around for centuries is
amazing because we're still kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering things about the plant,
whether it be medicinal properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the different compounds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for, you know, for us in his mid
seventies, for a 75 year old man that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing his whole life to come across
this and then be like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, like you also has a lot of
credibility, respect in the online
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the younger, humble growers that
were kind of in our circle of friends
[SPEAKER_00]: would go to him for for herb because he
had, he had the high grade and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a lot of outdoor, you know,
so they would go to them for their head
[SPEAKER_00]: stash at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would trust him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony knows what he's talking about because
he's been growing longer than like most
[SPEAKER_00]: people that we know and smoking and,
and still is really passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that he's like, Hey,
this is it to a youngster like me is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I need to pay attention to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I feel like we're in a,
in a time where people are open because
[SPEAKER_00]: they, it's magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that have never
tried a vape pen or an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even those things can be new to people
when for other people, like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like, it's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so there's always going to be
something new, even to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced smokers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think something like this,
you know, when you, when you pull it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of our viewers probably
don't even know what pearls are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so this is the number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, so this is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a seven, six or seven different
phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a one or the one, the two,
and then the A, B, C, and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the A is the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the, in pearls, you would
class them like Dr. Grinspoon would be,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get pearls from Dr. Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that creates a single brach bud
is a pearl, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a, I think it's a trait that
exists within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another, there's somebody else on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of, I think maybe one other
person I've seen with pearls and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: pearls from the destroyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's a, he was referring to
like a single brach or it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain type of plant that actually spits
out this type of calyx or brach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a pearl plants,
but these ones in particular, there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: some, some plants that have self and we've
got some seeds out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those get planted, they all also turn
out like pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got some Oaxacan pearls that
we're working on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a strain from Oaxaca that spits out
these single calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so far it's, it's one of the few
varieties out there that is putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: pearls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to get the Grinspoon in Amsterdam
and that was what the Grinspoon from
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam was this most, it's some of the
strongest flower and it's very reminiscent
[SPEAKER_02]: of Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked my, I last asked my
father-in-law the other day, cause every
[SPEAKER_00]: single person says Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even DNA genetics commented on.
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA is the one who gave me a bag of
Grinspoon when we were in Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012, Don from DNA was like, you ever
smoked Grinspoon?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, he's like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody gave me some Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, it's super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, whatever, you know,
I'm like, I've been smoking haze and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was so strong that, you know, it makes,
it would give me heart palpitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm at about a point where I don't
say, I'm not going to say I like heart
[SPEAKER_00]: palpitations, but I like, I've,
I've learned to deal with the raciness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the highs.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear me talk a lot about
my father-in-law, Tony, cause he's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that really has turned me on to all this
and has really dropped a lot of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and game on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's these hoops of
fire, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get through them, whether it's
120 days of flowering or it's a low yield
[SPEAKER_00]: or someone going, that looks like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I ever want to smoke that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's the same with the racy
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once you get comfortable with that
and you know, what's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be a little more okay with how
high you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can also take it easy and not
smoke quite as much in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you, you know, I feel like
everybody has different tolerances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe you don't need 10 hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you only need three, you know,
that's one of the things that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like about the Pearls is you don't need a
big fatty, you know, it's really shifted a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these sativas, these long flowering
varieties have shifted my perception or my
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation that like you have to have,
you have to smoke a lot of weed to get
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, there are some, I mean,
I, you know, people give me weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the more like shorter flowering
varieties don't get me high as much where
[SPEAKER_00]: they get me high in a different way for a
very short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These varieties, you know, they get you
high for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something interesting about the green
spoon and I'm, and I'm trying to get Tony,
[SPEAKER_00]: my father-in-law to kind of, to get online
and clear this up because I was talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: him about this the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my buddy, Danny from GW smoke break,
we went to high school together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Danny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all about the pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing a great job at kind of
showcasing them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely got, you know,
some pearl content that he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made a post recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says Dr. Greensman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every single time I post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, Tony, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says Dr. Greensman and I'm going
to mess this up right now, but I'll try
[SPEAKER_00]: and say in like a, in an authentic like
kind of a true way is that that Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenspoon was something that somebody
else purchased from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took that and then called it the
Grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like this, the Dr. Greenspoon
that everybody knows as Dr. Greenspoon was
[SPEAKER_00]: something before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It for sure was named after Dr. Lester
Grinspoon.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, so Dr. Greenspoon for most
everybody is, is this one specific thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was actually a strength train that
was made by someone else that they saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh, we want to buy the
seeds to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they gave it the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has no genetic resemblance to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen Lian Ray stuff that the
bus out pearls that I've popped before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw somebody recently, they're like,
Oh, it's not rare if you grow out fields
[SPEAKER_00]: of tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, okay, yeah, it,
it might not be rare if you grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: fields of tie, but who's growing out
fields of tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's nobody else has this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if somebody else is like,
Oh, I got a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like for you, the sour, like the sour
is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've had it the whole entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been rare for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all this perception of who you've
met, what your experience is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got a buddy and you know,
you say, Oh, I got some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got a buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at like the top tier of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some good weed level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I knew when he said he had good
weed, it was going to be better than
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else is because his experience
with good weed was elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that of everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, he had an experience that
was that of above, maybe say even me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my father-in-law is quite a few
notches above where I am with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you want to know what good weed
is as somebody that's been smoking for 60
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that's been smoking for an
extended amount of time, they'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: their opinion on what's good and what's
not good for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that just comes with experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he, he has no interest in seeing
any of this sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stands to make no money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what he likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, he's like I said,
he's smoked a lot of other stuff in his
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is what works for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people might like blue
dream and that's their favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's one of the going to
go down is like the most overhyped yet
[SPEAKER_00]: most underrated hybrids of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the best hybrid of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you take an indica and a sativa
for backup lack of better terms and
[SPEAKER_00]: created something that just had this crazy
vigor that went wild outside and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it up outside and get huge numbers,
you know, with a great smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's what I really like about this
Bubba Kush original haze is it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like right down the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more of the original haze high,
but it's got the flavor and the look of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it looks, you know, somewhat looks
like indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the morphology of that plant is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like checking the boxes as from
a grower's perspective, it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vigor of it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that hybrid vigor that you don't
see in a lot of plants and it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: enough credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think that's because Justin
Bieber said he liked blue dream because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody and their mom was growing it
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like everything you too many
people start to do it and you get too many
[SPEAKER_00]: watered down versions of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get, well, it's too easy to
grow good, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was growing sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a point in, in Sonoma and Mendo,
and there was some people in humbled as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, but they tried to blow that out a
little bit, but there wasn't a lot of good
[SPEAKER_02]: sour on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were growing inferior cuts too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got mine pretty early on and I
got it from the guys that came out from
[SPEAKER_00]: the East coast with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like I got a cut off of a
mom, off of a cut off of a mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: off of a bag seat, off of a cut of a mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that who knows, maybe that's where
my cut came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as I know, that was just like
the cut from the guys that brought the cut
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a bag seed and they were growing
it in 1999 in honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember the first time I saw that I
saw the perps and the sour both for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time in the same week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was showing it to people and I
showed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw the purposes in the Mendo perps or
it is in the GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause before the GDP was called GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called the perps or.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name for it,
but it was the perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the perps, you know,
soon after it turned into like the GDP and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was coming from Humboldt to Tahoe
straight as the perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like nothing else any of us had
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to see both of those for the
first time in the same week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show, I was like, I was like,
Hey, check out this perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got, my buddy was like,
yo, screw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that stuff from last week?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we were, I got weed every Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how my program was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I got the perps like,
you know, and now looking back on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, damn, I had two of like the most
legendary strains in my hands in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sour kind of went to the wayside
until a couple years later, I started
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing it again from my buddy introduced
me to his guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, you know, got to go a little bit
more direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an SF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's probably around the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were getting hip to the
sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started seeing it in 99, 2000,
2001 was buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I ended up getting my
hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were good years for sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the price point, it was expensive back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, flour was just expensive in
general, but sour was the exotic of its
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't, it wasn't super accessible
for really good sour anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys would only let me buy an ounce
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like for all those people
out there that are like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just be thankful that you have access to
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like, you know, you would get one
ounce when it came around 400,
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 bucks, maybe 600 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was what somebody wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even still people to this day be
like, Oh, if you got sour, I'll pay you
[SPEAKER_00]: like name your price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just commanded that it was
such a different high back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's maybe why I'm
gravitating towards these pearls and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the high is different than,
than everything else out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I find myself not getting as
confused anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking like, you know, these pearls are
just like laser sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really gives you a clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're a, if you're a computer
programmer or you're an athlete,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one day they will consider certain
types of herb, a performance enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: drug for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at, I mean, you look at the Diaz
brothers, the reason they're such good
[SPEAKER_02]: fighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would, I would say that there's
that contributing factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the only thing, but it's able,
they're able to smoke and train and to be
[SPEAKER_02]: hyper focused when they train.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you look at a lot of these
jujitsu guys too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys smoke heavy, but yeah,
performance enhancing for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I like smoking and doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even cardio, it makes cardio better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the African haze 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, me and my wife, we smoked that and
then we work out together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got our little like routine
and it's, it's great for, for athletics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's got me, I think you,
you know, we've, we've hung out a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of times now and I feel like people,
when they hang out with me, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look at me like, what's up with
this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: He seems pretty enthusiastic or pretty
excited about a weed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like, seems like it's just
dwindling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that these types of flowers get
out to people, they can have the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and then they can have that
kind of passion kind of put back into
[SPEAKER_00]: their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause whether you're like a seasoned
smoker, a grower, a hustler, like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that makes you feel good and
just kind of like brightens up your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my buddy, Danny from GW, he's just
like, dude, every time I smoke the pearls,
[SPEAKER_00]: it like instantly within five seconds just
makes things brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't done a lot of
psychedelics or really any ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine that these pearls are kind
of like at the bottom end of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic threshold where it's not quite
there, but there's these elements to it
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can see could be similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes all it takes to get someone
passionate again is to remind them why
[SPEAKER_02]: they love the plant so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can show them a different side
of it, man, it's, it's, it's, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to be that person,
for me, it's, I feel like I've been just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out what, what my job is
on this planet for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think I stumbled upon it
with this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I mean, I've loved cannabis my
whole life, but we can't just do weed
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to do three other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we have to do other things,
you know, and you do other things as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do, you work with Oakster Dam on
some level and also, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with your wife's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an Oakster Dam instructor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the horticulture department.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also an expert court witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an expert court witness is basically
somebody that, you know, testifies in
[SPEAKER_00]: court on behalf of a client who maybe has
a civil dispute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you're a cultivator and you have an
investor, you had an agreement,
[SPEAKER_00]: a contract, you were supposed to produce X
amount of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were going to sell it for this price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a court case with your
investors because they're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you didn't do your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or on the flip side, these cultivators are
relying on an investor to put up the money
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can get their equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can get their plants in the
grounds and get their clones at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can plant at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a disagreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get hired to kind of be like a third
party, unbiased opinion to the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll look at a bunch of court
documents, pictures, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, videos, and give my opinion about
what I think about the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get called to the stand during trial a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times I get a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, Hey, we're interested in hiring
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send me court documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send me paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I review them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write a report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then most of the time I get deposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the opposing counsel gets to sit me
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out recently for up to eight hours
in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, a couple of weeks ago was
deposed for almost eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically a lawyer getting to ask
you questions about the report that you
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot about depositions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could, you know, I mean, I feel like
you're basically being interrogated for
[SPEAKER_02]: eight hours, especially by the opposing
side, um, trying to poke holes in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in you and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No poke holes in every, like this guy
recently, he pulled up everything I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever said anywhere you could actually find
it, you know, and I was not ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you have to be able to,
um, respond accurately, quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like, lawyers I feel are kind of
like a freestyle rappers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you have a situation where you have
an outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're doing a rap battle and
someone's dissed you and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got to come back at him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing with the lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the lawyer made a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've got to come back and make my
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be able to quickly analyze
what somebody said and then to say
[SPEAKER_00]: something back factually.
[SPEAKER_02]: The better the lawyers, the better the
battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like some of these lawyers,
you know, it's, it's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my wife's an attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's specialized in cannabis for,
you know, around 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: She worked with Tony Sarah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome law offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and she used to hire Chris Conrad for
most of her criminal cases, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing happens for a criminal case,
except for it's against the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so Chris bless his heart has been
just kind of like passing cases onto me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I don't know, he's done
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm kind of following his footsteps
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was a big proponent of prop
two 15 really involved with Oakster dam
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and kind of pioneering a lot of their
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a legal standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of fell into the whole
expert witness thing through my wife and
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, you know, I started getting a
couple of referrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an Oakster dam student that took,
uh, one of my classes that referred me to
[SPEAKER_00]: a law firm that he got a job with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's, you know, it's kind of my
other thing that I've gone into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, for five years was trying to
figure out what am I going to do as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator that now doesn't have a gross
space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had my own grow on Yuba County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not friendly to cannabis growers
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, they, they rate every
neighborhood about every 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was there on the 10th year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't hit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when they did the flyover,
I was in between plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't see any plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't stop in my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, after they rated the whole
neighborhood, I was like, I'm out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was already living in Washington,
working for a company up there managing a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly decent size indoor at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came back, started working for
other people and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you trying to find my kind of my
place in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I kind of just fell
into this expert witness thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just fell into these hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father-in-law has been doing this his
whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first met him 12 years ago and I
started smoking with him, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: damn, this guy's like, uh, I was like
proud to show him my harvest of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had sour, I had Pacific Northwest dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Big Sur, holy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had some genetics that I thought he
would be stoked on cause they weren't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even 15 years ago, 10 years ago,
weren't wasn't blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the run of the mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't grown gorilla grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just kind of like, that's cool,
but check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, look at this shit,
you know, like he, he busts open a T a T
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 with, you know, some stuff that almost
looks similar to the pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to Hawaii 12 years ago,
first family vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went on with, with the family and we
smoked his herb the whole entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even smoke my herb because he's
like, you know, he's kind of an alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just like, I'm smoking my weed son,
you know, let me show you what's up
[SPEAKER_00]: youngster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm new to the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, maybe testing the
waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, I'm dating his daughter
and she's a weed attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been smoking weed her whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that week, I was just like,
damn, there's something different to this
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had just come off of a light depot
out in grass valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yo, I want to put these
hazes, these sativas in a light depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only re the only way I thought
it could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now doing it indoors growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's got hazes that have gone 22
weeks inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's growing these pearls inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something different, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Grinspoon, the Grinspoon used to
stretch out so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, I've, they have seen it stapled to
the wall where they've, they've actually
[SPEAKER_02]: stapled it to the wall because it
stretches so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about growing it like a,
like a vine on a vine, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just two branches going opposite
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've got 20 in a greenhouse right
now and they hit the 10 foot mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a month ago, they just,
they're weird cause they, they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: weep down at a certain point, almost like
a weeping willow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go up and then they start to go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's the biggest mess ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they just kind of grow into each
other, harvesting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you saw like just pulling out this
bag is just messy, not a big yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stoked that I got onto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love unique things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as the Big Sur Holy,
my friend Mojave Richmond used to gift me
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Sur Holy flower, along with sage
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe the Big Sur Holy was one of
the parents of the sage that he created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my thoughts were always that it was
either a sister to like the original haze
[SPEAKER_02]: or something very, very close because I
feel like the effect, the structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the things, the boxes that it checked
were the same boxes as the original haze
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the funny thing about you know,
I'm teaching cultivar selection at Oakster
[SPEAKER_02]: Dam actually in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that class is like,
just cause you were given something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: called this does not mean that it's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deal with that in my court cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you know, cause they're
trying to discredit me in every single way
[SPEAKER_00]: they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you ever grown this strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, do you have a genetic stamp
for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, then it's not, you can't prove to me
that it's that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't discredit me from saying that
I haven't grown the strain and therefore I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know anything about these genetics
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, I shouldn't be able to say,
so it's like, that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find myself a lot of times explaining
to these lawyers, like stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any proof of what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's like, it's hard to
tell, but as cultivators, we are our noses
[SPEAKER_00]: as growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's something with us growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that like memory that it's just
like, boom, you could smell something one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and smell it 20 years later,
like the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, boom, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unmistakably it like,
yeah, I mean, no doubt in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've smelled like cat piss,
if you showed me the real cat piss and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was able to actually smoke it,
I could tell you a hundred percent with
[SPEAKER_02]: the first hit if it's cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my desert island.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could smoke anything the rest of my
life, it would be the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because I've shown
the pearls to a few people and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, this, you know, it's some of
it's got a turpentine dominant kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like nose to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it smells like a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it smells like seven up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten OG Kush notes out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time and my father-in-law also got
that out of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, some of this is a little
bit older.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the great thing about hazes is they
store really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got some like year old indoor
Bubba Kush original haze that still looks
[SPEAKER_00]: and smokes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like limonene and turpentine
are the two dominant turpenes in haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you look at Jack Herrera,
which is super high in limonene and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera I've seen, it has the least
amount of shelf life of all the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've basically tried to age and cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some stuff and a lot of these new
varieties, they just don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf life to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like they harvest,
they peak and unless you're keeping them
[SPEAKER_02]: in optimal conditions, it just starts
declining within probably two weeks of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time where it's perfectly cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these other, some varieties
I've been able to keep perfect for four
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's just so, so strain
dependent as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to me too,
cause we talk about the soured,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it can be finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I first started growing
it, I was growing it inside and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a quarter pound of every harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every two months I had a new quarter
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had four jars in my closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a two, a four, a six month and an
eight month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just referred to them as the four
month, the six month.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the eight month hit the eighth month,
it was better than the two, four and the
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was as good or better than it was
when I first harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've heard some people talk
recently about like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf life, maybe it has something to
do with the inputs that it was grown with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there's absolute truth to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think maybe, you know,
a lot of people weren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the sour cause they wanted that
dank sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew guys that grew hundreds of pounds
of sour cause they wanted to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their sour was money sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like love sour, you know,
it wasn't grown by someone that like
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted some dank sour to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted some sour to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always the best when you got the
guy who, well, I feel like there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that just, they don't smoke and they
grow and that's, it's a money thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's guys, my friend Josh
Freeman used to grow the sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_02]: his sour diesel was that kind where it
just stayed on your palate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the perfect, he was up in Casadero
and it was outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know, there's a banana
belt up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you grow the sour in Cas,
I feel like the sour from Cas is the best
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like sticky in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd open it and it'd punch you in the
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time he used to grow it,
it was like just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but he was a sour smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a sour smoker now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I was telling him about the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, man, I need to get some sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just split some.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's, he's one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just loves the sour and every batch he
used to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all, all passion, you know,
and people, you put your energy into that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that plant gives you back what
you put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys that aren't smokers,
a lot of times it's like, maybe these guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are good at growing at scale and they can
produce good stuff, but there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: special about the passionate guys that
just love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're smoking their own product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these guys, they weren't even
smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would, you know, they use grow more,
you know, I mean, I think we all at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point have used things that have mono
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphate in them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, I will definitely not
pretend like I'll be the first to admit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have, but that was like all that
they grew with, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of organic guys, you know,
maybe some synth, you know, kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that do the blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you do like a booster mid round and
then, you know, you finish up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're doing just hard cams,
you know, it seems to like my buddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was growing hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were both growing sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using botanic air.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was using advanced nutrients and the
soil beds came out better, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what he used to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would just say that when we were out at
shows smoking, you know, I grew 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably 10 pounds of sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I grew it outdoors and my
friends that saw that harvest and would
[SPEAKER_00]: like, if they smoked this sour in that
bag, they always, always say that first
[SPEAKER_00]: one was the one I was up on summit in
Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived like 50 feet into Santa Cruz
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I went onto the other side of my
street, I was in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Santa Clara County and I was half
of a mile from highway 17 and that sour
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the herb I grew up there was some
of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my father-in-law was growing in
Lusgatus about, you know, probably two
[SPEAKER_00]: miles as the crow flies, I think even at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of his friends, a lot of the
people I've met that know him are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that weed that you were growing
in Lusgatus was like super, super dank,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that area, that pocket,
not even like Corralitos because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: drier, but that like summit pocket,
the southern end of summit road,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it gets just enough moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: My landlord, when I moved in, he's like,
oh, you're growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all upset at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh, he's like, this is such
a great spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fog comes in, it kisses it,
and then it disappears by nine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't deal with as much mold,
but that little bit of humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that sour was just like,
I made a name for myself with that sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like that first batch I
kept growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kept coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was relatively similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like just having that
consistency, you know, so then I started
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting other guys that were a part of
that crew that I got my sour from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started seeing other sour from
the guys in that crew and kind of going
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, okay, this is what, you know,
the subtleties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd be like, yo, this guy's sour
is like the dank, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started taking notes of like how
long they flowered it for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people are like, oh, the sour is
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes this many days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my most recent sour harvest was 56
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last one, two months ago was 70
something days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This most recent batch is going to be
better than the one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say that like, you know,
what something is, how long it flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: for, what the flower structure should be
like, is maybe a little bit more limited
[SPEAKER_00]: than somebody that has a lot of experience
growing that variety and maybe has tried
[SPEAKER_00]: different things to manipulate it,
to do different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to get like that area sour
because it can be a little stinkier than
[SPEAKER_00]: like the super dense sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, indoor, I think there's a lot of
reliability and a lot of consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start moving towards like
green greenhouse, whether it's mixed light
[SPEAKER_02]: or whether it's straight greenhouse or
outdoor, each step has a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: variables and things that can change
conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: With indoor, I feel like there's a lot of
repetition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing the same thing over and over
and getting a very similar result at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end, whereas greenhouse, you can try,
but like even with greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're relying on the sun, you're
getting different amounts of light
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your PPFD is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one variable alone, also just the
natural humidity, which you can control
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity to a degree in a greenhouse,
but there's so many little things that
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go outdoor and it's
completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So outdoor is more like wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got one rip a year and from one year
to the next, you see it different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love waiting to see what's new.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's this year is going to turn out?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much rain did we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much did the environment affect it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what did it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as growers, not necessarily as
much for the consumers, but as growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go, oh, you remember 2005 or whatever
that year was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year is going to go down as a great
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a hundred degree temperatures
in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have never had a hundred
degree October.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see a different outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to remember, I mean,
I remember it was like 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like a stretch of like 95 days
temperatures in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, like, I don't
remember this happening, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: since I've been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have these markers in
weather that produce different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think this year, I'm seeing a lot
of, a lot of the different genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different cultivars out there
finished earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that's attributed to the hot
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I think that's one of the,
the attributes I'm seeing stuff that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't expect to be early finishers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got guys when we were at Canifest
showing me buds of finished products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, wow, from, from my seeds,
I was like, that's frigging cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never expected that to be an early
finisher and it finished in mid September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting how weather, weather
affects all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why outdoor growing is so
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was doing indoor,
it was like, we were doing the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same day every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, that's really good by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm like, I'm like, I took like two
hits and I'm really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took two hits cause I want to see where
I go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I feel really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm definitely lifted,
but I feel very communicative,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess is the right word.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like I'm sometimes if I get too
high, like I have to think about stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it just flows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and there's a handful of
things that I like to smoke that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of this stuff, man, it would get
me so high on a show where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I start talking about just random stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of staying focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the cool thing about the pearls
is it does get you high, but it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: focused high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, it's like a,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it's like in the front of my face,
in the front of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find myself going like, damn,
I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in this really like not a racy
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think sometimes like with the
African haze, that's more of that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like racy side of the high where you're
like feeling that intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where sometimes for me,
the kind of like I can kind of like just
[SPEAKER_00]: go somewhere else with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: The African haze you gave me was really
special too, but it was pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I find myself, I mean,
what we both took a couple hits and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about how high we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, to me, that's the
marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like joints like this and I'm like,
you know, I feel like I could smoke this
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing and I probably would be about
the same level of high, but different,
[SPEAKER_00]: different effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to really be like humble in my
judging of the weed that I get because I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like I'm super lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super blessed to have been kind of
married into a family that like has a such
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been turned onto something that I
normally wouldn't have ever found highs
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would have never experienced that I
find myself enjoying so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I just don't really smoke the
other end of the spectrum anymore because
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it so much that I don't ever want
to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to be objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to check things out so I can check
myself, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So people give me weed sometimes,
you know, one of my homies, like he grows
[SPEAKER_00]: killer, killer outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best outdoor, you know,
I picked like three or four of his best
[SPEAKER_00]: that he did one year, rolled up a whole
entire joint of it, smoked the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: entire thing to my dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, I don't know how long
ago, a couple months back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I was just waiting to get
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really good weed, but it didn't
get me high, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's partially due now to
smoking things like the Pearls or the
[SPEAKER_00]: African Haze where it's like, I'm
expecting to get high for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and in an intense way that people are
like, yo, what did you just smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're like buzzing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the weed I smoke now,
I'm just kind of sitting there waiting for
[SPEAKER_00]: something to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something happens, it's like this
lethargic feeling that comes over me for a
[SPEAKER_00]: short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then afterwards I'm kind of like,
eh.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's going to laugh at me for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't pick Skittles out of a bag of
20 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing the Sour heavy up until
2015, left California, started growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: another, for a company in Washington,
right as the Skittles hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back, I was working for other
people that weren't growing the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started doing my own thing,
the Sour was the first thing I got back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe like I've grown the Dosey
Doe, which I think has Skittles in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always hear people talk about- No,
Dosey Doe times Skittles is Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Dosey Doe is its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like Dosey Doe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything that I've smelled fits
into 1.5 categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say 1.5 because it all fits in the
same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some stuff that I've
smelled that's like just barely outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the category for me, but I'm just like,
it's not far enough away to get me into
[SPEAKER_00]: the zone of like the African haze has a
really distinct smell, even for hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell like a traditional haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I try to be humble and I try
to be objective and bias and still know
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's other great weed out there
that can get me super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not what I prefer to smoke these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother, he was a really good grower
out the gate and I was really not a great
[SPEAKER_02]: grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so slowly over time, I didn't even
know that I wasn't a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people don't even
know because they haven't grown long
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the 90s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the early 90s to the 2000s,
I learned what good flour was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even, I still feel like I'm learning
what good flour is and it's constantly the
[SPEAKER_02]: needles changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm having to reevaluate and look
back at stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like smoking this for the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can smoke a whole joint of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just sit back and smoke a big joint
and it might take me 45 minutes to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: one of these joints like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I enjoy that meditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost like a meditation for me
where I'm sitting and smoking and just
[SPEAKER_02]: contemplating, maybe contemplating my day,
maybe contemplating how much I'm enjoying
[SPEAKER_02]: life right now or how lucky I am to be
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like some of those things,
where some of this stuff you can smoke and
[SPEAKER_02]: you could just sit there and do it,
I do enjoy the smoke side of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the whole enchilada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it up, smoke it, sit there,
get high, think about it, think about some
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that kind of the final part of
the process from growing it, cracking the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, whatever, planting the clone,
to breaking it up and really getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: what do your fingers feel like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it roll?
[SPEAKER_00]: My father-in-law has this crazy criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the weed falls out of the paper when
he's rolling it, it's not good weed.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll like the Skittles then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Skittles reminds me of the Mango
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sunday Driver reminds me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to rattle them all off
because it's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA has a Sour Banana Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the Sunday Driver, the Sour
Banana Sherbert all remind me of the Mango
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush that I used to get from these dudes
that had the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to the tea, but that's what I go back
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That fruitiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a little bit of gas,
but this is a special one because they
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest on day 53.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to day 61 or 62 or 63,
it ends up being much gassier,
[SPEAKER_02]: much less, it's not fruit forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, when you break it up, when I'm
rolling, I smell fresh cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love stuff that's unique like that
where I'm like, oh, it smells like this or
[SPEAKER_02]: it smells like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love complexity and I feel like this has
the right amount of complexity for
[SPEAKER_02]: something unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it's not the strongest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not the stuff where you're
like, wow, the effect was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, it can get you high, but it's a
different kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a relaxed kind of like White
Thorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, White Thorn is its own thing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has, I feel like White Thorn will get
you high, but it's more like Johnny said
[SPEAKER_02]: it best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like getting a hug from your
ancestors when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I smoke it, I think that,
you know, like it's funny when somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: says something like that and it triggers
this feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or this thought, like when I smoke it and
I don't know if it's because he said it or
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's how it makes you feel,
but it's probably a combination of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of White Thorn Rose,
Johnny and Jason, they were in the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: together, Jason from Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another one where terroir is so
specific in light and elevation because
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny gave Jason the cut of the White
Thorn, but it doesn't grow the same on his
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was selected and grown, you know,
and Johnny's been working for over 30
[SPEAKER_02]: years on that property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he gives the cut to Jason and it
doesn't grow nearly as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so terroir and, you know, climate and
environment is so important to different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what performs the best, you have to
really try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few different ways, you've got to
kind of like put it through the,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it through the test to see,
you know, is it good indoor strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good outdoor strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause some strains can be the
all in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are just like,
like the perps back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not want to grow that outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I never saw perps that really
never met anybody that was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love outdoor perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was, it was a really good
indoor strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never even thought about that,
but you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, all the pretty, I mean, I saw some
other purple stuff that was good outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not, not the GDP or the perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackberry Kush was another one where it
looked beautiful, but it didn't get me
[SPEAKER_02]: high at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had some tests a while back and
it tested at 8% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was going to like take
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really, white and frosty,
but had these like purple and like maroon
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hues to it on the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked crazy as a plant too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would bush out and it would get tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some big Blackberry Kush plants and
they would get really purple and really
[SPEAKER_02]: frosty, but then it was never,
the stuff we had was never strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always like borderline pretendica.
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of CBD on the market
right now that people are passing off as,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that they're intentionally
growing CBD flower, but I feel like some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this flower is reminiscent of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you should be able to
take a few hits of something and feel an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't then, you know,
maybe like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's creeper, then you feel an
effect 15 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the stuff you've given me has
done that, where you get that creeper
[SPEAKER_02]: effect where, you know, we always used to
call it creeper bud, where you smoke it
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you're not really high for about
10 to 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, it's harder to control the effect
as much, but that's good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like those kind of, I feel like
those are like weekend strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: just weekend varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even like a creeper pheno of like,
like my father-in-law sent me a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: the other day and it was like a creeper
pheno where it like grows wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so out of all the varieties that he's
grown, you know, he really likes to tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he thinks that like a lot of the
more psychedelic type stuff comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's always like beyond the
lookout for the ones that grow sideways,
[SPEAKER_00]: like real long, narrow branches,
the creeper ones that grow sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's like, it's kind of how the
pearls are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just like go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They vine out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, and it's, it's a
pretty good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about the statement
that the high, the length of the high is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is in comparison to the length of the
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to have your father in law's
opinion on that, because I, I believe that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that like some of the longer,
like 16, 18 weeks stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you, some of those varieties
that finish in 16 to 18 weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you smoke them, the high is super
low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can get a three hour high out of
some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been my experience with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've grown 100, 120 day
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's grown 22 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many days that is,
but it's way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I kind of mentioned that
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I get a lot of, I get a lot
of this from him, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's validated by like the stuff that I
see also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those pearls, you know, is definitely
one of the longest flowering varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that we continually grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like the longer the flowering
time, the longer the high lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The African Hayes 11, the pearls,
there are things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can last an hour long effect just off of a
few hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think that, you know,
there, there's something to that
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation with how long it takes to
flower versus how long you stay high for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just starting to see that he's,
you know, he's been grown for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think really had anybody
that's like done the back and forth that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have with him about these long flying
varieties, because nobody's grown them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, my younger self,
even five years ago, I was in having the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with him, them that I am
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's always been like, you just got to
grow it, just grow it, just grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met someone recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, yeah, you know, we're trying
to like figure out a way to like
[SPEAKER_00]: reincorporate these like long flowering
varieties back into the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, who's we?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, just everybody in the
community now was like, well, you just got
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, and that's what he's been
telling me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to plant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, but it takes longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this like, it's more daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there's not as many rewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you pop some seeds and he got
the one out of the 10 out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyer, but that one was definitely
worth the 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like he said, like not all pearl
Finos are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like some of them just aren't
worth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the amount of people that are
going to be able to speak to that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he would be a very good starting
point for people to start to look at like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is a dude that's been smoking
for 60, 56 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing for that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: He still smoking and he's still finding
things that get him high in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't meet too many other 70 year
olds that are like, yo, I just pulled on a
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a joint, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ever since I met him 12 years,
he has not slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we got to get him on the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get him on the show to,
to lay a good framework for what I feel is
[SPEAKER_00]: about to happen with this whole long
flounder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a very inspiring thing
because once people have access to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: once they can feel how me and you are
feeling right now, they're going to want
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to want it to a point
where it's going to be like, that's all I
[SPEAKER_00]: want, you know, because I've had a few
people that I've like given enough herb
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to smoke for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yo, like, you know,
I can name a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once there's the access to it,
that's when it's going to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Bay, there's no access,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, I see it way more up in Humboldt
and Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you get to the Bay, it's all this
one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is a company in the Bay and I
don't know their names and I'd love to
[SPEAKER_02]: have them on the show too, but they're
exclusively growing Sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've heard about them from a couple
of people, but I don't remember the brand
[SPEAKER_02]: name and I would love to have,
you know, it's like, obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: accessibility is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky to have the access that we
have, but like it's really shifted away in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bay from anything Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might find a dispensary that has
one or two options or a few options,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're in my opinion, I haven't seen
a lot of good options, but why Spark has
[SPEAKER_02]: some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always apt to like look at a menu,
look at their Sativas and then kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, and then I asked what
makes it a Sativa, you know, cause I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand because I have a
company that specializes in growing these
[SPEAKER_00]: long flowering or these Sativa varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get somebody else's opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get somebody else's gauge of
what they think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody replied to me and said the
turpentine is what makes it a Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's an interesting thought on
it, which I could maybe say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of varieties that most
people have experienced that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: called Sativas do have a turpentine
dominant profile in the U S for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those aren't what I would consider you
would consider or my father-in-law would
[SPEAKER_00]: consider a Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to respectfully distinguish
between a Jack, a blue dream, a sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of these things, those are
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are hybrids that might lean a little
bit towards Sativa, but those aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily really on the Sativa spectrum,
especially, you know, like blue dream is
[SPEAKER_02]: great, but that's not a really turpentine
dominant variety either.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it just, it has the, the traits of the
shorter flowering indica in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, but it's got that vigor and bud
size and just girth of that original haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, even the leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a thinner leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the thinnest leaf in the world,
but it does have a thinner leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I've seen some NL
five haze crosses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people call, so you've got the NL five
haze and then you cross that with
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love NL five haze by the way,
for a Collins cough, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see like you cross that with
something that's, let's obviously indica
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now how much haze do we have left in
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with genetic recombination,
it's depending on the traits you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take a 50% indica and a,
and a, and a 50, and a 50, 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does that 50% of the other two go
down to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to call that a Sativa to me,
to me is misleading because now of my what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to navigate those terms,
I think that's why we've landed on long
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering varieties because it lends
itself to like, Oh, I do like that term a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it's more descriptive of the,
the growth patterns of, of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then looking at what people call a
Sativa and I go and I asked, I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's a Sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they point me to something that has a
lot of characteristics of something that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like a short or flowering variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go, okay, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I see OG Kush labeled as a Sativa
sometimes in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I mean, there's a lot of
stuff that I feel like is mislabeled and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so complicated because using Indica
Sativa hybrid is just so general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then even if we just started talking
about a terpene profiles, that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: even better in my opinion, but I love the
long flowering aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really distinguishes it and makes it
very specific to stuff that flowers long
[SPEAKER_02]: because I have some gelato times Mexican
haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a, you know, less than 60
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you can get the effect of a
haze and that short of flowering time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's like the golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like the African haze 11 is in
flavor and smell is nothing like the
[SPEAKER_00]: band-aid haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: The band-aid haze is more of that like
traditional haze smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think terp profiles are really
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a better conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though is a, you know, especially if
you're trying to sell flower and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to describe effect, a lot of times
flavor and effect can go similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about like the citrusy
varieties, as opposed to the gassy funky
[SPEAKER_02]: or GMO even, I feel like those can kind of
describe effect a little bit, but even,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, terpenes, we talk about
flavorants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if, you know, abstract tech
and their abstracts tech and their white
[SPEAKER_02]: papers that they wrote, but they go into
talking about flavorants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And flavorants are like files,
sulfur compounds, all these things that
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't traditionally discussed in the
conversation with terpenes that actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot more to do with the aroma and
the taste than the actual terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in about 2013, 2014, I was,
I was like, what is, what nutrient is most
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for flavor and smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked it up magnesium or sorry,
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an easy form of sulfur is magnesium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sulfur is most responsible for flavor
terping and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started going hard on magnesium
sulfate on sulfur because that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant wants to like produce those terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now, and I think we recently saw a
paper that came out and said these things
[SPEAKER_00]: about sulfur being that compound that's
responsible for the skunky aroma in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my homie sent me a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, yo, he's like, you were right
all along, you know, cause I just started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it out of like, nobody had really
like talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I, I went to work for a company and
my buddy had the respect of the owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was like, yo, like let's try to
incorporate some sulfur into the feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think it's a little more common
that people are using sulfur as something
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and enhance that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even botanic care started their sweet,
which is just magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do like that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used to use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use it anymore, but I,
I used it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, all that stuff, you know,
goes into, and I mean, even the sour or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I grew some bandaid outdoor a couple
of years ago and it looked like crap and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was crap, but it still got me higher
than everything else that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a low oil content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have a lot of crystal on it,
but it was getting me higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still trying to figure out how is
that possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's, it's such a
complex plant and we're still learning
[SPEAKER_00]: about it that there's gotta be something
else besides everything else that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered that would allow an everyday
smoker to smoke that at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: and take one hit and get so high that like
sometimes, you know, like even recently I
[SPEAKER_00]: was out somewhere and I smoked a half a
joint of that and I almost got too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when I say too high where I'm
like, I'm about to trip out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the only variety out there that makes
me feel like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have a way that we can sneak it
into the world where they don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: see what the flower looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-rolls, I know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-rolls right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pre-rolls, I've always believed in
pre-rolls because I feel like we're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: world of convenience where people want
something convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can take away the way that it
looks and you can just provide them with a
[SPEAKER_02]: description of the effect and how it's
going to make them feel good and they
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it and they get that, they're going
to want to, they're going to gravitate
[SPEAKER_02]: towards that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want to revisit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think pre-rolls are the best in a
lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as long as you can get them fresh
and they don't sit on the shelf for six
[SPEAKER_02]: months, I think pre-rolls are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a great way to showcase sativa
type flowers that may not look super
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing from a visual standpoint,
but we got to get people past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls are a great way to get people
past that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have the experience, the effect,
and then they're going to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: receptive to looking at the flower and
thinking, damn, that's what's getting me
[SPEAKER_00]: so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we get to a point as a culture
where we look at stuff like this and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, damn, I can't wait to see how that's
going to make me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this prejudgment of, it looks like
we're breaking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think a lot of people,
the first thing that would come to mind is
[SPEAKER_02]: that that doesn't look like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do you feel right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel uplifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I could go exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I smoked just the right amount
to where we're having an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation and time just, I feel like
there's this thing and I get it from
[SPEAKER_02]: microdosing mushrooms and also from
smoking the right amount of weed of the
[SPEAKER_02]: right cultivar where I don't have the,
like there's this connection between when
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk and when I have to think about
stuff and it just sometimes flows and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll like, when I exercise, I'm not
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a handful of things that can
get me into that, that mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I feel like I could pretty much
do anything on this and have a great time
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to tell you, it just makes you feel
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really one of the best ways
to describe it, because it's making you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel all these different ways,
all of which are just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheno is 16 weeks, unfortunately,
because it's the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recently got into a new greenhouse
and we were doing some planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father-in-law was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he got to come in and water the first
set of transplants on a greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_00]: was like kind of, you know, first try with
all these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked some of the A and I was just
like, I was like running through the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, like flapping my arms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's like going on a
magic carpet ride, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it takes you somewhere,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think part of what,
what I'm trying to do is bring people back
[SPEAKER_00]: to like, when your uncles, your aunts,
your mom and dad, you sit and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking weed back in the sixties and
seventies and how good it made them feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever hear them talk about like,
oh, I used to smoke all this weed and like
[SPEAKER_00]: fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always like, we used to giggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to go out and do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I want people to have that
experience, you know, and to like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: take it back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of old school people that
don't smoke anymore because the weed is
[SPEAKER_02]: too strong and it's strong and they
probably think it's too strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe it's just strong in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they liked the stuff that was more
uplifting and not the stuff that was so
[SPEAKER_02]: narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's probably a lot of truth to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even, even for younger people,
you know, it's like, you may say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, like my grandpa used to smoke that
shit back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, for good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's also going to be
appealing to young professionals,
[SPEAKER_00]: young entrepreneurs, athletic kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a, the family member,
they're engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke some pearls and they're just
like instantly like, yo, we want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: start solving these problems that we had
at work, you know, and they're in their
[SPEAKER_00]: late twenties, early thirties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's going to go past like,
Oh, this is like, you know, this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: father-in-law on the shirt, Tony Budglero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an old school looking image,
but it's classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's timeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: These varieties, it's timeless weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you feel so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to be talking about this
into the next couple of generations and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, dude, my great grandparents were
smoking on that shit that made them feel
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden this like weird
like divergence came and people kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like took this sidestep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know who Tom Hill is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good friend of my father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me a message one day and he
was just like, yo, he's like Tony,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony got off track with those OG ladies,
you know, and now he's kind of like back
[SPEAKER_00]: on track and like for the record,
Tony never fell off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just maybe went a little bit more of a
direction than Tom did in like sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: with these crazy 20-weekers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like it's going to be come
something that's appealing to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: because the effect, the way it makes you
feel, the creativity, the problem solving
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects, the performance enhancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Band-Aid Haze is a great
antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just heard somebody talking
recently about like there's no medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Band-Aid Haze is an antidepressant,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to get that- Yeah,
and you get memory recall is what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the memory recall aspect of it
because then you don't have to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just flow and that flow,
you know, it makes you feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're in conversations a lot and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's so many benefits to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody said that the other day,
one of my buddies, I think Danny was
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just like, you know, I don't forget
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, a light went off because
I've been on this sativa kick for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years now, like really only smoking
long flowering varieties, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, a light went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, when I smoke even the sour,
I'm forgetting all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my homie Danny from GW, he,
every time he's just like, I feel focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, he's like, I'm dangerous with
this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I feel like I could do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a laser sharp clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me realize that my memory
recall has gotten better with smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: these types of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really believe people will find that
there's a lot of benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the, how long the high gets,
you know, last floor, how high it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but there's all these psychological
factors that go into it that when
[SPEAKER_00]: harnessed the tech world is going to be
like, yo, we want you to microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to smoke this hay shit
from Budu Laro because it's like the two
[SPEAKER_00]: ends of the like focus spectrum,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keep you focused, cleave you clear,
but so creative that peep like some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even Steve jobs is reported to have
kind of gotten a lot of these ideas for
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple after tripping on L a few times,
you know, and I could totally see it for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, visionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that can open up parts of your
brain that you didn't have open before,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And give you perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, life is all about perspective
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we have these lenses that go
over our eyes every time we experience
[SPEAKER_02]: anything and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to pull some of those
lenses off and to see the world from a
[SPEAKER_02]: different perspective really puts the
grander scheme and all these other things
[SPEAKER_02]: into perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like it's, it's always
great to see something from a different
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people just do it naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other people, they need, they need
that assistance, whether it's L or whether
[SPEAKER_02]: it's smoking a little bit of really good
stuff or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get that with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, I'm real heavy on the long
flowering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, it's like Tony says,
you know, it's all good, just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I believe that even like the
worst grown weed you could ever imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sprayed with, with the worst
chemicals, the most dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful chemicals can still save and
change somebody's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not promoting to grow anything like
that, but I believe the plant is so
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful that even if you try and make it
into this toxic thing, it has this innate
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to bring out the good in itself
and reveal to you something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing out of something that somebody
else didn't give a shit about and was
[SPEAKER_00]: treating as a dollar sign to the extent
that they were willing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we used to smoke Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a lot of that Mexican brick weed,
you know, and that still had its,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would give you a headache if
you smoked too much, but it still had its
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was really good weed,
just not cured in process really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Mexican weed is some of the,
like the strongest weed out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a good batch of Mexican in
Mexico, right off the vine, like we do
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere else in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, like the pearls,
we put the pearls in somewhat of a loose
[SPEAKER_00]: brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like high grade brick weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, somebody could really say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when I look at it first time,
I'm just like, what the fuck, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is what we're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you showed me all this other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen all this other stuff and this is
what is driving conversations now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really stoked to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that I can, you know,
just continue to, you know, get these
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on some of these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you got some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: One breeding projects and potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I feel like I'm in it for the long
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized how much is actually ahead
of me with the rest of my life to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to do some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really is a, a commitment to the
plant, a commitment to yourself and a
[SPEAKER_02]: commitment to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that takes a lifetime,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this stuff, we talk about what we
can do in five years and that's great,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like to really make a difference,
it could take a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lifetime's worth of searching
for Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's made a difference in my life
and it's made difference in other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't breed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just stumbled upon it from the seeds
that he popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, but we're all on the
shoulders of giants at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: including him, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody else did some work.
[SPEAKER_02]: He found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have the opportunity to really be
able to pass this on to somebody else
[SPEAKER_02]: someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's the beauty of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know, and I feel like for me,
I always like to share, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I had my first, my first plant I
harvested cause I couldn't afford to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, Hey, got some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shared it with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I kind of continued to
grow and I found that that was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I really enjoyed was sharing
herb because I knew how profound of an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect it could have on somebody's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew that if I could give enough weed
to one person, that weed would end up in
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could affect a few people with one
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we get the person that I
shared it with is having an experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with the next person down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talk about like five, six,
maybe 10 people having hopefully a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive experience off of the few nugs
that I shared with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that is like, if you're going
to be growing a lot of herb and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it as a living, please give them
some away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share it with other people that don't have
a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share it with your friends that maybe have
a tighter budget, you know, share it with
[SPEAKER_00]: people that need it and, and get into
their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that has been something
that I've really enjoyed out of all of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is being able to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like when like, like for me,
from a breeding perspective, like where
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken and crossed two things,
whether I created the parents or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: but where I've crossed two things,
I've grown that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the finished product and I'm able
to share it with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you're sharing part of
yourself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you know, and they're
getting to experience a part of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I get other people that grow
out my seeds, there's just another amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling where you're like, I get to smoke
some of my flower that somebody else
[SPEAKER_02]: imparted part of them into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's why the plant is so
beautiful because it all, it brings us
[SPEAKER_02]: together in such a unique way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, food can bring us together in a
great way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a chef, you cook some stuff or
if you grew vegetables, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: similar, but it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the full circle that goes on with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of amazing, totally
different things that stem from the one
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like with the Sauer, you know,
um, the chem, you know, that one
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction or maybe whatever,
however many few interactions it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about the butterfly effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, like that one interaction,
had it not happened, like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: who knows where it'd be with you,
you know, and all these, these amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: coincidences potentially, I guess we can
call them, but like, it depends on how you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at life too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like when we met, you know,
I'd recognize you and, uh, I had no
[SPEAKER_00]: intentions when I approached you other
than like, I know you like weed and we had
[SPEAKER_00]: a conversation and it kind of led us to
this, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I, I think there's that type of
opportunity with every conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing that a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I set out on this journey to
bring these long flowering varieties to
[SPEAKER_00]: the market 12 years ago, when I first met
my father-in-law and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, this is the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it indoor, even though we
both now have now it's been, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really recent that I've kind of like
really put it out there that this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's because I've been
preparing for so many years, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like on a, I mean, I worked on the name of
the company for two and a half years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I got a trademark lawyer and he
was just like, he said yes to this one and
[SPEAKER_00]: no to the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, other people might say,
Oh, that's a waste of money X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, and Z, but I'm not going to let anybody
tell me that I can't use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably, I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody tries to use my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody's going to know who the
real budgerer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my father-in-law, Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who this is all about, but this is
the brand that we've started together,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nobody else is going to tell me I
don't have the right to use this word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a powerful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about protecting our
genetics, you know, because the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the loss of ability to operate could
put a business out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have genetics that you are
holding that are special to you or need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be saved, your loss of ability to operate
can now make all that disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all spent a lifetime building up
whatever we've built up and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to let anybody or anything jeopardize
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my wife's a weed attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, here's your box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go outside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go outside of that box,
we're liable to ask for trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great having a lawyer in the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny though, cause in the two 15
days, like when we got together,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, everybody's like,
Oh, you got a weed lawyer for your
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That must be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I was going to be able to do
whatever I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was just like, well, if you do it like
this, then when you go to court,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I can cover your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't, then here's going to be
our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is kind of a common sense
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to be doing it, I might as
well do it in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has an amazing track record for
getting people out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even people that hadn't kind of followed
the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she's gotten pretty much every
time she's had a case, like it's gone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the client's favor, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I better just take,
if there's one thing I've learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen to your lawyer, take your lawyer's
advice, like whatever they tell you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're a good one, they're just trying
to look after and you protect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was like, Oh, I can't do all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do all this crazy stuff that kind
of sucks, but it kept me in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably prohibited me from doing a lot
of stupid stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gave you guidelines to operate by
that made sense for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm an expert court witness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of like comes full circle of
like understanding these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: being like, you know, knowing laws,
being able to interpret them and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of being a little bit in
that world also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's, it's definitely been a
crazy journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think really from a breeding
standpoint, you know, the after or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Kush original Hayes, it's a great
hybrid, you know, it's a real solid 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to take those things and
match them up with something new,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where there's going to be some
really awesome magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see some really good
traditional looking weed that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And baby, we can get out of this
predominant Terp, this dominant gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps on infiltrating all the different
crosses and get some other stuff in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of start a new chapter in like,
okay, well, we, we got it to tweak a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it looks like when the cookies
hit, they hit a profile that nobody had
[SPEAKER_00]: really ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it like, it changed a lot of stuff
and it, and it took everything in a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we're going to see that
happen time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when, you know, how many times
it's going to repeat itself in every 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're on thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this cannabis stuff, you know,
and in the last 30 years, we've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: handful of those OG sour cookies,
train wreck, you know, those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that have left a long lasting
impression with all of the generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the generations know cookie sour and
train wreck, you know, so it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like you, like my father-in-law
that have been, you know, going this
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, that direction, when we kind of
come together and we've fused those two
[SPEAKER_00]: together, that's what the magic's at,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's potential for some really cool
things to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the, the more,
the more people you have that are skilled
[SPEAKER_02]: and are really strong with their skillset
that's different from the other partner
[SPEAKER_02]: skillset or the other people, it always
compliments the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, especially two people go
in two directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can put two people go in two
different directions that are on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: path and you have those collide,
then you have this amazing opportunity for
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool things to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of like when I was growing
the sour, you know, my buddy was doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: more, you know, synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it more organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were growing other stuff at the
same time, but he had a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a spot together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had five spots and we were just
like, and we saw, we were at each other's
[SPEAKER_00]: house all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at each other's spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were helping each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't even get a chance to
include the ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was just like, we see what's
going on at each spa and really we both
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted good weed, but it allowed us
to really like see the differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that the way that he was
growing the sour was different in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was growing the sour and we both
liked the way that I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew the sour for long enough over
and over and over to learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's would be my advice to anybody
that's just starting out and just take one
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic and grow it 10 times because
you're going to be able to identify a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiency after those multiple
times of growing it as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, maybe what you're seeing in another
plant isn't a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's its signal for over or under
watering or X, Y, or Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really want to be good at
growing and grow the same plant for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years and try and harvest it as
many times as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the sour still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been growing it since 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on 23 years that I've been trying
to like play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty amazing that long
with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've lost the sour six times and
had to go back up to Washington to my
[SPEAKER_02]: family up there and get it back six
different times because we had a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping stuff alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to great lengths to keep it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really put trust in a few people to
keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would call my buddy every six
months and be like, do you still have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would for a couple of days,
I would start to stress really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard when it was out of my
possession because they're out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just stopped growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's what happened in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually they stopped growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I don't have that exact sour
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would get really stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd call my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was like, as soon it was like
the day that I could get it back in my
[SPEAKER_00]: possession and I could do it without
having a landlord messing anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I need that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started growing it under LEDs
and it was not the sour that I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: from the HPS that all my homies had grown,
the outdoor I had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gave up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like literally, and that was honestly
was interesting time either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about the time I started growing
the hazes and the long flowering stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of like filled that void for me
because I would have been jazzed for like
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, I finally get my
chance to grow the sour again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come out that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, I was bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is something that like,
you know, people used to call me diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave when I would like take into this one
dispensary, you know, and I had this like
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong connection with the plant
and I was really let down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I gave it to a buddy and he grew
it out last year outdoors out in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yes, it still has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, cause you, what you
smelled, what I, what I knew you were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to smell was very particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you smell that you're just like,
okay, it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's not there, you just kind of
like, it's like, I was a serious bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw last year and I was like,
cause I hadn't grown it for like five
[SPEAKER_00]: years myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd given it to a few people that had
tried it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of my friends that had seen
it grown when I was growing down in Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, right, I'm going to try
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, thankfully it came out good
enough to run a second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm definitely going to be running
quite a bit more of it as I kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the swing of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because with sour before I saw
your sour, I was kind of second guessing
[SPEAKER_02]: my own memory and thinking, did I really
remember it right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because so many people have been giving me
sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some from some really reputable
people that have been on the show that
[SPEAKER_02]: gave me, you know, nice flower,
but not the sour that I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my, the back of my mind for the
last, at least the last year I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: like, was my mind playing tricks on me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And turns out obviously it wasn't,
but it's great having that reinforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's things like cat piss that
I haven't seen in so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's probably still out
there with the right person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't found the cat piss that I
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people with cat piss,
but it's not necessarily the cat piss that
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's named something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it was never cat piss,
but it has that same turf profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's been a few varieties like,
um, that Skittles you showed me the mango
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and the sour banana Sherbert all have
that similar kind of dominant turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's another,
some other genetics out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that, uh, it's the root beer for mean
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, oddly enough, within a few months
timeframe, saw two other genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: totally unrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them from out of the state that
had that same profile, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from people that didn't even know each
other or didn't even know that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple varieties of herb out there that
had that same turf profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the black lime reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number three and the number five from
a Jackson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mean gene, freeborn gotta love the
freeborn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's smoke some of this sour before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you brought a little present right here
in this paper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, um, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little different structure than
the last stuff, but this is real sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is even better of a nose than last
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that is, and it's a little dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not really this other buds are
different, but it's not Fox quite as Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: tailed as the last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be honest in an attempt to
hope that someone else doesn't make a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar mistake that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into a lot of the
details, but the last batch had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I learned about potassium too
late is that it can have some negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on bud formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that last round, it really didn't
like fill out or do what it normally does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like totally weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one is a little bit more
representative of the typical bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, those ones got bigger,
you know, they kind of get that those like
[SPEAKER_00]: big, wide classic sour buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but this location has a lot of sun,
you know, it's up on top of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets sun up to sun down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like, you know, the sun's
doing sideways shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you're going to see it lean a
little bit more towards the dense size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not, not as dense as like the Bubba
Kush original haze, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's those variations of
most sour, isn't getting a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: unobstructed light at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've drawn in spots where it got
less light and more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw fluffier versus dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Southern facing hill size.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get real good, good light,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, that was Casadero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it was so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Southern facing and it did get a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it didn't get a lot of fog,
but it definitely would get a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more humidity and it wasn't nearly as hot
as more inland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the sour, it always had the
best nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing up, that was where we used to get
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but the flavor of this, you know,
I'm sure the flavor, we'll have to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's, that's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, with all these land, I have 70
land raised varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have more from Dave Mesford
that I want to, you know, hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has some, uh, Nigerian black
crossed with, uh, blue 13, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the, the blueberry Hayes times Kevin
Jodry's, uh, Louie the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's some really special
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to go through all this stuff
and figure out what you're, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just so much then it's like,
okay, well we got to pick and choose the
[SPEAKER_02]: starting point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, it's time and space
that really, as you know, that depicts
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, but I think there's,
there's a very good reason to dedicate
[SPEAKER_00]: time and space towards pulling out some of
these longer flowering varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping them separated and then remix them
into new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then being able to say like,
I got two new things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a, a big advantage in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then yeah, doing that work,
you know, cause it's like, you talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: normal breeding projects, how it can take,
you know, you flower plan out two months
[SPEAKER_00]: later, you make your selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, four months goes by and
you get maybe two breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a year because of the amount of time it
takes to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that can really, really slow the
amount of progress you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also be, um, discouraging when
you wait 20 weeks and you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: something worth keeping, you know,
a lot of the guys that are still growing
[SPEAKER_00]: these long flowering varieties seem to be
like older retired dudes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're doing it cause they love the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how do you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you take something that takes 16 to
20 weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like so good that you have to share
it with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you bring that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you put that out into market?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like my bandaid Hayes has
seven more weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be done until the end of
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started flowering in the beginning
of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to breed with something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a whole nother level of passion
and dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why a lot of people
aren't doing it, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, uh, we're here to deal with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm here to, to, to do this
long flowering thing and try and bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, the, the older generations,
the younger generations to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I love innovation within
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's going backwards in a sense,
I feel like sometimes we have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: backwards to go forwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's so many things that are
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people think they
know what they like until they've
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced something that's outside the
box that they really enjoy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be open-minded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the ego just has to go away for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can try something that's different
that maybe, you know, and I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of ego out there too,
especially with growers and people who
[SPEAKER_02]: they believe they're connoisseurs and they
know everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would look at this and,
you know, probably give, give it a thumbs
[SPEAKER_02]: down before even trying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the pre-rolls are so perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I knew a lot about weed until I
smoked this, you know, I've been smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, since 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing since 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had, you know, had a lot of
harvest too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a sometimes I like in my
own ego, I guess, makes a distinction
[SPEAKER_00]: between like growing for 20 years versus
how many harvest you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you're cranking out,
you know, like nowadays, like some
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are, they're harvesting a
hundred pounds every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you learn a lot quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could take a five year grower,
could actually be way, way, way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more skilled than a 20 year grower,
just cause they've been harvesting every
[SPEAKER_00]: three days for five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of insightful knowledge in a
very short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn a lot of knowledge,
but a lot of stuff is super automated too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you might miss the nuances
of, of growing boutique flower where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it becomes a commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're growing at such scale that I
think when you're growing at scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to grow, you have to look at it
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you're growing boutique flower,
you can really get to know a cultivar
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it over and over and over on a
small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that with a large scale too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's still like trial and
error at a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but when you're hand watering and
you're looking at a plan every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something special about that too,
that you get a different experience of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the difference between having to
make sure that a 500 life facility is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing enough weed so that the facility
can stay open is different than growing
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that like, you want to show to
someone you really expect that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: likes good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that was always the challenge
for me was, you know, cause I had an
[SPEAKER_00]: instance where I was growing gorilla glue
for a company in a 400 life facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that had a four lighter brought
their gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to take it to work and be
like, guys, like this is what we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be going for, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were things that that company
was doing that we kind of switched up that
[SPEAKER_00]: improved, you know, the quality a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we grew good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good herb, but was it the kind of
stuff that I grew at home?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could have gotten a little bit
better had we not done certain things that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really worried about failing
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were spraying, um, oxidate at the
end of like the day of harvest and then
[SPEAKER_00]: kill off any mold basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we stopped spraying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, we had this one variety
that just didn't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the harvest, after we
stopped spraying, I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff has some flavor to it,
you know, and we're not failing tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer not spraying at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Grandmaster, I mean, that's
obviously the best, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you can not spray it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, even my outdoor at home,
I'd rather deal with picking out,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, caterpillars by hand than spraying
them with anything, even though it's for
[SPEAKER_02]: seed, I'm going to get a little bit of
hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do this little seed crop at
home every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of years back, I did huge seed
crop, but Grandmaster lighting has these,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, new, UVC lights, bug lights,
and I'm super excited about testing them
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, so you don't have to spray,
uh, we're running into a couple of my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends' facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have bugs here cause we're a
closed circuit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But still as a redundancy and in between
rounds and just to be safe, they have
[SPEAKER_02]: these UVC bug lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really curious as to how they work
with all my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's, they're new on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're available and they're very
affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, to be able to not spray
anything makes, makes the most sense to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, if, if I could grow and I was
a cultivator and I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing a lot of lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want a product that could prevent
me or at least assist me in the IPM,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, model to where you're not spraying
stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not the rotation because a lot
of guys, they rotate through stuff so that
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're being preventative and I like
preventative, but if you were able to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it without spraying, that'd be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten on this, uh, this new,
uh, bug identification system that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like cause it speeds up the amount
of time that you can find a bug in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I've got a smaller
greenhouse, so I still walk every aisle at
[SPEAKER_00]: least three times a week, you know,
and I do a pretty hard stare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I've had a couple of things
pop up that were like small little issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, nutrient wise, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can detect also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it'll basically notify you
through this camera that has AI,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey, you got a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the company that I'm working with is
called Fermata.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of, I think they're based
out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, like I said, I mean,
it'll, you know, if you've got spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, it'll identify the spider mite,
send you a notification and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: like make a change accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show you a graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can look at my greenhouse and
it'll pinpoint the plant that the issue is
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and I think they've been using
this technology for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I remember back in the day,
I heard like you could, there's a company
[SPEAKER_00]: that could find a one specific plant in
the Amazon with this like detection
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what they do is they
get like the, the, the footprint,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of a spider mite, the footprint
of an aphid or whatever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the damage it makes and they can
just like hone in on it and identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's down to like,
it'll be able to show you everywhere it's
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you have one plant that is
starting a nitrogen deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to ping for that one plant and
it'll show you exactly where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have a large cultivation
site and maybe you can't have people
[SPEAKER_00]: walking up and down the rows or whatever,
this is something that you just boom it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's, you know, it's pretty quick to
identify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I can't wait till they can identify,
uh, I think using ethylene, they'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to identify herms very easily if they
haven't done it already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about trials being done with
infrared and some other tech technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked this company, I was like,
can you detect male flowers from
[SPEAKER_00]: aphrodites with this software?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can, that'll be a game
changer for breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said it's a different camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, they, the, the camera they
have is they chose for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for a lot of applications and
it's scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other things that you could do
maybe with other cameras that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the scope of their focus
infrared drones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so yeah, you can put these
cameras on a field mount in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: spot and just put it on a post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do it indoors, outdoors,
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good sour, good sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like super fresh, still has the sour
taste, but it's super, super fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I, and I still like the
Skittles when I got it the other day,
[SPEAKER_02]: I still smoked it super fresh just cause I
love the flavor, but this one,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, I really want to cure that out
for another week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put them in some turblocks and let them
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I give you turblocks last time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you try those out at all for curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I haven't cause it's kind of
been in between, but I have them now and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got some freshie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to do side by sides too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put some in a jar, put some in a Mason
jar, put some in a Turkey bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: put some in the turblock and then really
do side by sides and take a little butt
[SPEAKER_02]: out and smoke it like once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll really be able to see the
difference of, I feel like the Turkey bag
[SPEAKER_02]: goes first, then it's the Mason jar and
then it's the turblock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got a fresh batch of sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that stuff, um, you know,
it wasn't even really snapping on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably let it go, you know,
another five or six days before I even
[SPEAKER_00]: like take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, one of my measures of
good sour is itch when it burns,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should taste like good sour,
even if it's two days after it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it should have that dank sour
smell the whole entire way through drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can smoke it at day five,
when it's obviously not ready to be smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: and it still tastes bomb.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sour is a real greasy one anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it's sometimes when it's grown
perfectly, it doesn't feel like it's dry
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, you know, you can still
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I like to say, uh, squishy,
squishy bud, snappy stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's like, that's what you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can just crack that stem
and it's like, just bounces back to where
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so if people are trying to find out
more about you or they want to buy some of
[SPEAKER_02]: your flower, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can check me out on Instagram,
Headgrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can check out Budularo Humble on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's where we have a lot of the
flowers showcased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're about to launch the brand
Budularo into California stores in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of months, uh, just ironing
out the last couple of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody is interested in this type
of herb, if you're a buyer or you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, um, just have, you know,
just reach out to me at Headgrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the coolest Instagram names ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must've got in on Instagram really
early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very hesitant at doing it because I
was working for a company at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, I don't know how
they're going to view this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I was really hesitant about just
like even having an Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never been somebody to like show my
face anywhere, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is definitely, um, I'm embracing
the changes necessary to kind of like move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always like a super behind the
scenes guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on the show
today, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, we have to do this again
sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
