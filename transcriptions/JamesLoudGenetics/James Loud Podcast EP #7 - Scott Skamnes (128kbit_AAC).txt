[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to this week's episode of the
James Loud Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my friend Scott from Crescent Soil
Solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm doing fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be on your show when
we're down in the single digit episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, man, it's just great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Scott Scamness.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I run a business called
Crescent Soil Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do agricultural consulting of all
types, but we primarily spend time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's how we met James.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's why we're here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met originally at the Black Sheep Boot
Camp, I think, five years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some events where you were talking
about soil and I was talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a good group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had some of the top people in
the industry talking about a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely been fortunate to
participate in some really cool talks and
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been invited on stage next to
extremely qualified people, of which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just to be on a show with
you, with somebody with as much time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry is definitely an
honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously right now, being on the
James Loud Show is pretty damn cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk to everybody about how you
got on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me a call last week and we had an
opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, you had seen one of the
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, I've been keeping in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you and I talk periodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I've got a large client that
needs seeds, you're pretty much the only
[SPEAKER_00]: person that I go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we talk here and there and keep up
on the industry stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been watching some of your
episodes and trying to keep track of them
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just had Chris Castle on who was a
living soil grower in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of remember exactly what you
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the first few minutes, you were
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: About how you've seen some significant
obstacles with living soil at scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even haven't seen a real solid
example of successful living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I would agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, well, obstacles,
I guess you could say, to doing living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, most people haven't
figured it out, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people haven't seen really solid
examples of successful living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I like to pride myself on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consulting that my wife and I do is
directing some of those very successful
[SPEAKER_00]: examples that you might know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting about living
soil, and I guess really any market,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that those that are working in
extremely competitive environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't exactly produce a manifesto and
a how-to of what they're doing to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially now in these early years of
regulated cannabis, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are actually just telling you
exactly what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's leading to a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's the added complexity
of, if you're having a conversation with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic farm, they just say,
I'm doing rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expect a tray table with rockwool
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing undercurrent, you say
you're doing undercurrent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if somebody's in soil using bags of
grow more and spraying Eagle 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're calling it living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's people that are taking a lot of
liberties with the word living soil right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's part of the problem,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So living soil is becoming a popular
buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are trying to jump on that
train, which I think leads to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100% agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of stuff out there
that I will tell you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it is, I don't know what to tell
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely a believer in living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come from a really qualified
hydroponic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my main mentors was a guy named
Randall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he built a facility called Candescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of how you feel about
Candescent or what they did, they were the
[SPEAKER_00]: first to have the most flower on the shelf
in the entire state of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is most people's goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to dominate those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I came up in what I
would assume is a similar type and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of hydroponic culture and success of what
you were doing in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just most of my connections were in
SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I didn't read any, I didn't meet any
real NorCal organic people till like 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the organic people that I
met growing up, there's only like two
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes the entire time that I met the dude
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was for the passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they definitely were not paying the
bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my inner circle and culture of
hydroponics that I came up in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were making fun of those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I found Dr. Elaine,
and started getting into living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started becoming one of those guys they
made fun of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was successful organics going on in
other regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was not in those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I didn't get into my first
Northern California organic farm until
[SPEAKER_00]: like 2014, 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time I ever saw
like truly, really legit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: organics doing well and paying the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of those hobby guys still grow
some of the best stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's in such small batches,
you know, and it's like so much easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: control your inputs and everything else if
you're growing in a small environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: a small batch.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what most people learn when they
go to scale in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where a lot of our services come in
handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started guiding commercial farms
back in 2014, started getting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado markets in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I come from an agricultural
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those earlier years of cannabis
growers getting the first opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to do large scales or even
outdoor open acreages, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparatively, I had a lot of scale
experience because I grew up in a produce
[SPEAKER_00]: brokerage office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up around farmers that were doing
hundreds or thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you could say that that was a
lot of experience for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combining that with my cannabis
experience and what we knew from other
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic techniques, I was able to
provide analytics and assistance to those
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what my mindset was is,
you know, if I saw a guy take a Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: variety or OG or whatever it was,
and he put it in an undercurrent system
[SPEAKER_00]: and he got a certain result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he put it into a Rockwell system
and got a certain result, if we weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: getting those same results in organics,
I personally believe that it was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were doing as a cultivator that
was limiting the genetic potential of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because clearly that plant had a certain
genetic potential to do something in
[SPEAKER_00]: different systems like current culture or
excuse me, undercurrent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to name anybody by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I basically became obsessed with why
is this organic system growing slower,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing less when the same exact variety
could go into another system and
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly out-produce those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just became basically obsessed with
what were the conditions that led to a
[SPEAKER_00]: fast-growing plant as translated to
soil-based organic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and there's so many other things
like pathogens, like hoplite and Veroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think hoplite and Veroid is
the big topic right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have living soil beds and you get
hoplite and Veroid in your soil bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're pretty fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I would not actually
disagree because that's where living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: gives its greatest advantage in the
regulated market because you bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: these functions of nature that humans
can't just do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the main advantages of living
soil is that these biological creatures do
[SPEAKER_00]: all these magical things for us when we
put them into the right situation and
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we learned from Dr. Lane Ingham is
that when the plant has proper nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: balance and high biological activity,
all these other different biological
[SPEAKER_00]: functions are able to be performed and
problems are able to be dealt with that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get in a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the interesting things about
living soil is if you get to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point of biological activity and ratios
between bacteria and things that eat
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and beneficial fungi is that the
plant has the ability to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine off the virus material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes what it does is it'll make
like a callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the branch is coming up or whatever,
that virus material will get calloused off
[SPEAKER_00]: and make like a weird knuckle halfway up
the branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then typically everything above that
tends to be clean of the different virus
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it will then coordinate off
to an entire branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you'll see a plant that
looks pretty healthy, but then one branch
[SPEAKER_00]: will just look all dutted and shiny or,
you know, variegated or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I personally believe based
on my observation of working with
[SPEAKER_00]: literally millions of square feet of
regulated and unregulated cannabis is that
[SPEAKER_00]: as our IPM choices went up in frequency,
so did the virus material as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the older days,
we'd make one light application of Eagle
[SPEAKER_00]: 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it was kosher or healthy or
tasty or even past testing now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people were doing like one single
application for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are absolutely bombarding the
plants with citric acids, oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: and rubbing alcohol based pesticides over
and over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as somebody that creates,
monitors, and provides analytics to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space, I can tell you very
clearly the overlapping of trends are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dead on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think most of this virus material is
because of our choices in this repetitive
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over applications of IPM,
which in living soil, you can't really do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get these high biological
populations in order to have the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: clean out its own virus material,
you also can't be spraying IPM products,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, I think all this virus boogeyman
is mostly due to our current set of
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors and cultural practices within
the cannabis space, which weren't going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in prior times when this virus is not
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so with hop late night, I mean,
what I've seen is there's, there's guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that have it and they, they deal with it
and it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll pull out like the, the dotted
branches and not just hop late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about, like Pythium and
you know, there, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some, so many different pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and there's, there's some that,
you know, they don't do a lot and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some that definitely a cop latent that is
definitely affecting people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see some grows where guys have it
and it doesn't really affect them or it
[SPEAKER_01]: affects branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they give clones to another guy
and then it just decimates the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I would argue again that,
that there's still an underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the cultivator that only has a
branch here and there that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: affected, I would say that's the
hydroponic nutritional manifestation of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was just describing from a
biological standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, if your mineral chemistry is
on with your feeding strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can through mineral nutrition allow
the plant to do the same type of virus
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning of its, of its plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the guy that has just
one branch kind of go dirty and you cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: off and they're not that affected by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got somebody that their
entire crop gets decimated by the viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you paychecks that if you analyze
their reservoir, it's all out of whack,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably way too high in nitrogen,
not near the amount of calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably way too much potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of what's happened just through
experiential evidence or observational
[SPEAKER_00]: science, which I think legacy cannabis
growers are experts in making a way
[SPEAKER_00]: without data and analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just started tweaking the
recipes until it worked right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think what kind of ended up is
long story short, you end up with low
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of calcium, high levels of
potassium and phosphorus, which leads to a
[SPEAKER_00]: more stable stuff substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that as you're not managing water
content of that root zone, you still get
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of the nutrients and you don't
get an uneven stacking as they would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, which creates maybe short spindly
plants, low yields, or can be buggy
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why crop steering is so
influential right now because yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield increases significant when you
start to actually manage the water content
[SPEAKER_00]: and that substrate properly to be able to
stack those nutrients in a way that's
[SPEAKER_00]: productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under that type of water chemistry,
when you're running significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient calcium, high levels of
phosphorus and potassium and always
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, usually you will get the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get the potency and the quality,
but there's typically going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of susceptibility depending on the
variety and context, I guess, if your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment's good or not good,
you tend to get either powdery mildew or
[SPEAKER_00]: might issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how we start to control those
might and mildew issues, I believe is
[SPEAKER_00]: where this virus material started to come
in because, um, most of the consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do splits into two basic groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that just had catastrophic crop loss
in the regulated market, they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a way around it or those that are
doing quite well and are trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: peak performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really work with a lot of like
middle ground we're working with after
[SPEAKER_00]: everything went to hell or those that are
respected doing quite well and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get an extra edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that journey, we've done a
tremendous amount of analytics of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we say problems that arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we then the first thing that I do
is start taking the data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So analyze the reservoir, check out the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these very consistent patterns reveal
themselves when virus material is more
[SPEAKER_00]: common, I guess we could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, but the reason why I'm such a fan
of living soil is that nature has a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, kind of hard to wrap
your mind around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see experientially is if you
take a plant with high levels of virus
[SPEAKER_00]: material in it and you put it into a
properly balanced soil from a chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, and then you get the
biological activity up to and above the
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum thresholds defined by Dr. Lane's
work, the plant now has other abilities to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is virus material in that
plant, it either shuttles it to one
[SPEAKER_00]: branch, and then that branch looks like
shit, or it'll form like a callus around a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain point and everything above it
grows clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would, I would assume that those
people in your network that you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: the viruses aren't a problem are likely
running more ideally balanced nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also do this from a
nutritional management standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be dialed in on your
nutritional management.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not dialed in on your
nutritional management, and you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient in calcium, or what I would
define as deficient in calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: high in nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium, those plants from a from a
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of nutrition are going to be
more susceptible to that virus material
[SPEAKER_00]: decimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would say the data we've observed
shows that's really why it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that you absolutely can clean
up virus material through hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just industry wide, by and large,
most people aren't, we'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically analyzing what they're
feeding, you know, to know what these
[SPEAKER_00]: targets and ratios are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people just get really
good at running a brand, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: like within reasonable ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then from harvest to harvest,
sometimes there's fluctuation and those
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuation and results I would say is
coming from a fluctuation in the products
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people aren't doing, you know,
most people aren't analyzing their
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Crescent Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you guys do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and Sarah are, you know, pretty booked
up and you have a group as well of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that you work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with quite an interesting mix
of people along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I come from a hydroponic
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still periodically pick up hydroponic
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very often anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really selective at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, I just want to see anybody
that's been doing it stay in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so along the way, I've been able to
help some pretty well respected hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: names, mostly from like procedural
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take somebody that was world
famous in the legacy markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still new to the regulated
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the main ways I help some of the
salt based farmers is just managing the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated aspect and, you know,
keeping from test fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also help people with the analytics of
what they're feeding or fertilizing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd like to think that we were a
major influential part in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons why it's popular, because my wife
and I were the first people to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics to the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is, like I said,
I come from a very data driven,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of almost militant
hydroponic culture, you know, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: very strict in their behavior and dealings
and how they did things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got into organics,
everybody wants to be like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's just saying good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in the hydroponic world,
there are data and analytics that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can measure your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can manage VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, if you have the tools available,
measure the water content of your
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in organics, when I started to follow
Dr. Lane and take her courses and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I met nobody really for years
that was doing any level of analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd meet the random person here or there
that would do the occasional soil
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, basically I'm an
obsessor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay up all night thinking about
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by taking data points, it allowed me
to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was basically what we offered
to the organic cultivators in the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated space was we would come into a
legal facility that either recently had a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem or was afraid of having a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd take a bunch of soil chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd do a lot of biological assessment,
organize that into some sort of digestible
[SPEAKER_00]: format, and then present it to the farmers
so that they could act on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of living soil,
if you start doing a biological assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: of your facility, either from corner to
corner or rows or whatever, it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: reveal a picture of where the problems are
starting from basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from our viewpoint, we've done so many
of these analysis of farms of all size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very clear patterns from my
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we do is try to direct
the farm through data to change their
[SPEAKER_00]: procedural, what we would call cultural
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how they water, how they dispense
nutrients, how they do teas or don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: teas or what have you, and try to
streamline that into a process or package
[SPEAKER_00]: that leads to desirable numbers on these
various tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you do that in living soil,
most of, if not all the problems go away,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I realize is a pretty bold
statement, but that's really the truth of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a microscope assessment of
your soil and managing behavior based on
[SPEAKER_00]: those results, powdery mildew is the
easiest thing to remove from your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty clear percentage and the
ratio between what we call omicids and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we would categorize as beneficial
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you manage your watering,
manage your techniques to reduce those
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, then powdery mildew is not really
a thing, which I know is a pretty bold
[SPEAKER_00]: statement, but that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going from the legacy market as a
legacy grower, and then all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're approached with these VPD numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for a lot of us that have been
growing for 30 years, you always had your
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity below 50%, which is almost the
exact opposite of what you want to do if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're cultivating correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a scary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrifying to most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having high humidity, because we associate
powdery mildew with high humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a reasonable concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time I ever saw the VPD as a
concept, was one of the guys that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: define as my mentors was a pretty solid
grower and he had some equipment fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, you know, Bubba Kush,
60 degree room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were subcooling the shit out
of their buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of his equipment broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden he was like mid 80s
and high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And towards the end of harvest,
he like brought us into this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you guys check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the biggest nugs any of us
have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, what are you doing in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment broke and I just went with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of like through the hand of God,
put him into like the VP dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the green on the chart or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was mind blowing to me because
that entire group there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, they were growing Bubba
Kush's and, you know, trying to get it to
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 or whatever they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to walk into a room that was like 83
degrees, 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just mind blown that it was still
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can attribute some of the
increases in yields to actual VPD
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say that that's one of the
biggest changes over the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 15 years where we were excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we went from getting two
pounds of light on a four by four to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting three or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy how these like little
incremental changes of being able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: data to guide your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't like to make data or analytics
like the only holy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to, I still believe that
the farmer is the best calibrated tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's happening with VPD is so they
call it the vapor pressure deficit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically is there's a differential
between the osmotic pressure on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the leaf and on the inside of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hydroponic systems, that's essential
for drawing water nutrients through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out through the leaves on
transpiration, which is how you fill up
[SPEAKER_00]: fat flowers, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were keeping it below 50%
humidity, we might have been mitigating
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, but in a rockwool or cocoa
or other hydroponic techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're limiting the plant's ability to
transpire, which is basically sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they move nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are literally moving nutrients
through, I guess, a change in osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure between, I guess you could say
all the way from the root zone up and out
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how all that humidity gets into
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because the water movement is
bringing the nutrients to the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: growth tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why sometimes in a hot
corner, you got some spider mites because
[SPEAKER_00]: that difference in temperature that's
maybe slightly hot is affecting this vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to impact calcium the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you get, as you start to have a
calcium deficiency, you run into mite
[SPEAKER_00]: issues often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically too much nitrogen will produce
powdery mildew issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough calcium will start to be more
of like a mite pest issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're making seeds, you want to
run high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So- Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because seeds are made of nitrogen,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you said that in our little group,
that kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never even thought about that,
but we use seed in our composting because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty interesting little
tidbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had some, you had some diagrams
that you want to share with the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm really big on slideshows
and keynote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to show visual examples of what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some good ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely have some good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me try and give a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the answer to the question as
to why your living soil may not be working
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the main concepts that I
think is actually the biggest barrier to
[SPEAKER_00]: success in living soil biologically driven
systems is something called ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ecological succession is the scientific
term for what nature is doing on an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts at bare rock or what they
would call primary ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lava flow, flood, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it starts to what they call early
successional grasses, shrubs and small
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other type of trees and then
eventually an old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this progression, I guess this
progression would be called ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people completely are missing,
I believe, in all areas of cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's carrots, tomatoes or
cannabis, is that as this ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: succession takes, takes its process on and
plants get more diverse as you go,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biological system that supports these
various systems becomes more complex and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually starts to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here in a primary ecosystem,
you have mostly or if not all bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to get a little bit of fungi,
which are these orange dots as you move
[SPEAKER_00]: higher in succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get finally to an old growth
forest, you start to actually have more
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi than bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is one of the reasons why
there was such success had when people
[SPEAKER_00]: went into the forests of Humboldt and
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Northern California and plopped their
plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were plopping it into this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as cannabis got more and more legal,
we cleared these trees out and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: system kind of fell apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the work of Dr. Lane and the
stuff that I've seen, you could generally
[SPEAKER_00]: put cannabis into this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're relying on packaged bacteria
products, you're over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using any sort of compost
that legitimately has the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities and ratios of biological
organisms, which we would turn
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically complete compost or Dr.
Lane's trademark term of bio-complete
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, bio-complete and biologically
complete just means that your compost is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking into consideration these other
organisms that need to be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what happens is if cannabis
evolved on the planet in this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem and from a biological
standpoint, your system is only providing
[SPEAKER_00]: this bacteria but you're not supporting
this system with any of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that basically is the cascade of
events that leads to pest, slow growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common pest in living soil people
call thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan Wade Wright would argue that it's
not always thrips, but whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity of it, the bug that leaves
little shiny holes in the leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: drive living soil growers nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of the time, I've analyzed the
biological assessment of a soil that is
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming to have thrips is way over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would assert that to is without
this level of biological activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are not being delivered to that
plant at a rate that's fast enough that
[SPEAKER_00]: equals the demand on growth we're putting
on this plant with high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, short life cycles, fast flips
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for living soil to have the
growth rates proper, you need to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got to at least get into this
first realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start to get basically what
we would define as nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is happening over here, most of your
problems start to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty heroic things start to happen over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would be the situations that
most people don't talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we would define as fish stories,
because when you do try to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: them, people just interrupt you with your
line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but if you get into this range,
pretty magical things start to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a soil chemistry standpoint,
that's actually one of the bigger issues
[SPEAKER_00]: because most people aren't looking at
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that design your soil don't
seem to care as much as they should,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so chemistry in the soils we're
working with is wacky as can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a general standpoint, a healthy
soil, so an actual soil, whether that's
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil or potting soil that you've
manufactured should have somewhere roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: around 68 to 72% of that mineral being
calcium, somewhere between 10 and 14% of
[SPEAKER_00]: that mineral nutrition as magnesium,
and somewhere between four and 7% as
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go and look at a, maybe say like Fox
Farms or something, it's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like 50, 40, and 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at any of the dry mineral top
dress products that we like, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are great products, but the problem
is if they put this much calcium into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, the three numbers on the bag would be
zero, zero, zero, because you diluted the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at best you get 10% calcium and like
five to 7% potassium because nobody is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go into the store and buy a zero,
zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what happens is if you buy
any of the prepackaged mineral dry top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress products, and rely on those for your
mineral nutrition in a soil-based system,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you add them to your soil,
you are maintaining this same
[SPEAKER_00]: dysfunctional mineral chemistry balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't really take any sort of
scientists to realize that if this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant needs to see in your soil-based
system, and this is what you're getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consequence of this mineral
chemistry over here is you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional deficiency in calcium,
some advisors would argue that 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's biomass requires calcium,
and magnesium in cannabis is a yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get above, let's say 20%
magnesium, you start to significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: impact bag appeal, yield, frost,
potency, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to get a significant
quantity of potassium, you're creating
[SPEAKER_00]: weak and watery cells because the way that
the plant wants to build a cell is it
[SPEAKER_00]: brings calcium up into that plant,
and it builds the main structure of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cell with calcium, starts to fill it with
all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're filling it with potassium,
or rather, if there's a deficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, the plant can substitute it with
potassium to keep its life cycle moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're now creating a cell filled with
an electrolyte, which potassium is an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrolyte, which creates a weak,
watery cell, which is kind of what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about earlier about how under this
condition of high potassium and low
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, in a way, you're making your
plants more susceptible to really any
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, and especially some of the virus
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my wife here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like 5'1", I think, 5'2",
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a project we did in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I met my wife, she was living in
Utah, was not around any cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we started consulting together
in 2014, I had all the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she would do the microscope assessment,
and I would basically handle all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-related functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by 2018, she had done so much
consulting with me that she was becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: her own little cannabis official,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a project in 2018 with two
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had worked two years prior to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy named Sean, used to go by
Push Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sarah led this entire project without
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just kind of took pictures and hung
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was kind of like Sarah's senior
project of cannabis, and she led all the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization, all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of hung out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what you're looking at is
this is our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to try and maintain a control
any time we were trying to do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is seed plants dug into a hole
and just planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no soil prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no biological treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants did receive the same
fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did receive the same foliar feeding,
but they didn't receive any biological
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just dug a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's native soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there's some like weird
gaps here, because like we said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were trying to keep this as a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at the top of one of the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't get like a full planting
density, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were mostly looking at plant growth
response, yield potential and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to take this size plant
and do proper planting density,
[SPEAKER_00]: do proper row count per acre, you'd end up
somewhere around 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get maybe 1,200 pounds per acre
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this time in 2017-2018,
most of the farmers that were hiring us
[SPEAKER_00]: for broad acre scale work, their main goal
was like if they've got 1,200 to 1,500
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds per acre, they would feel pretty
good about themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had 2,000 pounds per acre,
they would be stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of as a visual size,
this might get you about 1,000 pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: acre at a proper planting density and row
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here on this side, these are the same
genetics, same seed, same growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: same cultivator, same property.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this row got what's called a yeoman
plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plow does a deep rip that goes
about 30 inches deep and it breaks up the
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hooked up a compost extract tank
that would inject compost extract deep
[SPEAKER_00]: down into that hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we were doing is we were
breaking up the agricultural compaction
[SPEAKER_00]: and we made sure that the top 30 inches of
soil were properly inoculated with
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we transplanted,
we did another compost extract treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: and I believe they received two more in
the course of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both are coming from the same seed
stock, same breeders, same crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: same cultivator, same fertilization,
same foliar feeding, same canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was just plopped into a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one got up to what we would call,
let me see here, go back up to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a biological standpoint,
they got into this range, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants on the left, it's this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants on the right are kind of maybe this
range, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was kind of a bit of obstacles at
this type of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really hard to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some significant budget
constraints on this property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't able to do everything that
we wanted, but nonetheless, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant change in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this side, they ended up with 4,000
pounds per acre of jarrable flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some COA somewhere on my computer,
but they were all 26 to 28% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly desirable outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, when you said living
soil kind of struggles, this is the image
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you had in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I heard it, this is the
image I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my head, I was like, well, when you're
truly doing living soil, it looks a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what most people are kind of
unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the biggest
issues with just kind of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to be really careful when I say
this, because I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory or I'm not trying to say
this, trying to be a jerk, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some significant cultural differences
between the hydroponic world and the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic living soil world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the living soil world, results are
less important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to like Jungle Boys on
Instagram, they're not like writing you
[SPEAKER_00]: poetry and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put a picture of their grow and
says, you know, I forget, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: double diamond cookies, June, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, this is what I did today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're not, they're not even
necessarily talking about what they did,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're not giving you recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, yo, this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if you go to the organic world
and especially the living soil world,
[SPEAKER_00]: the community is the most valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being non-threatening is the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supporting the gurus is the most important
thing, I guess we could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hydroponics, nobody cares about that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I came from, like, you weren't
even allowed to say, I read on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, you would get slapped like a,
like a meme or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, get out of here,
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, if you started a sentence
with, I read on the internet, they'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Nope, not here player.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd be like, go apply it to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's worth the shit, we'll talk
about what you read on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was so disallowed almost
violently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the organic world, we just have
this echo chamber of things that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: work, have not worked, have never worked,
are probably never going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody wants to be part of the
community talking about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so especially if you're just,
like a normal grower trying to decipher
[SPEAKER_00]: how to take a pathway into living soil,
and your only outlet for information is
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or some of the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is extremely difficult to truly be
successful, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, especially because the
predominant narrative in living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ironic part about it is there's a lot
of really loud voices that try to silence
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody talking about quantifying biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, part of that is by
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other major difference is,
you know, I worked for a hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, very massive, very well
known, you definitely know who they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you definitely know their investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hired me for the value I could
provide to their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, they had a lobbyist
on the organic regulation board for
[SPEAKER_00]: California called OCAL to make it more
difficult for organic cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2018, and I would say so we're
working with the first indoor farm to be
[SPEAKER_00]: OCAL certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with literally hundreds of
organic farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them know anything about they
don't even know it's called OCAL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you go to the hydroponic world or the
chemical world, they have lobbyists making
[SPEAKER_00]: it more difficult for the organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to go too much more down
that rabbit hole sounded like a kook.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another major issue is there's
people from different areas of chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture that infiltrate
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to make it difficult for you to
be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're if you don't have any
commercial connections, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know you, you know, like if there's
something going on, popular trend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, hey, James, what do you think
about this thing's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, yeah, no, that's that's a pay to
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're really doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a sponsor deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, but in the organic world,
there's a tremendous amount of effort on
[SPEAKER_00]: these pay to plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked for some of these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of take a major stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a chance to not do any of those
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, well, if I'm working with a farm
that's just doing something to promote a
[SPEAKER_00]: product, I usually don't mess with those
kind of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to be about what you're doing
and not just taking a sponsorship deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people don't realize,
you know, in NASCAR, the stickers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: car and cannabis, the stickers not on the
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still sponsor deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine these guys, though, with jackets
and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be kind of goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be funny is to see the
organic gurus with a Syngenta sticker on
[SPEAKER_00]: their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's definitely a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, you know, for the commercial
cultivators that have commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: connections, it's a little bit easier
because you're in a certain community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to a certain point,
if you get to a certain scale and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: made it this far, you're able to discern
on your own if a new trend is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if somebody popped up some new
hydroponic trend, you have enough personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experience to go, yeah, I don't think
that's going to shake out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but most of your average living soil
people don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a large majority of the people getting
into living soil are coming from other
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's most of my clientele.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of flack for that from people
in the living soil community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm here because I came from a
qualified crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not the facility owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the guy that did data and analytics
and help people be in business way back
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was calculating kilowatt hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was helping people manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just was the nerdy math guy in
the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as legalization continued forward,
that's still my role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm here because I'm trying to keep
people with cannabis experience in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you previously did cocoa core,
drain to waste or hydroponic, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to now do living soil,
I'm probably going to help you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and again, like if you're
just trying to succeed with your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: system and rockwool, sometimes I'll still
help you, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I think for the new entrance to
the market, so to speak, good luck
[SPEAKER_00]: deciphering what's shared on Instagram or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real good way to go out of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, there's some really popular
trends that are the swiftest way to end
[SPEAKER_00]: your career in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, by following what they're
talking about on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I used to kind of try to be
a little more vocal to try and stop some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gotten out of the way of that
train.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of work privately behind the
doors almost exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I just don't even bother
anymore, which, again, that's why I was
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be an educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do presentations and workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really do those anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think one of the last ones I
did was probably with you and Blacksheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I may be done one since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we do classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have what we call master classes
where I mean, we work with four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: tent growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got a couple of other
commercial farms that go through our our
[SPEAKER_00]: master classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we've distilled down the
full complexity of our consulting work
[SPEAKER_00]: into five and eight week modules where we
meet through Zoom like this and we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: private forum and we meet once a month
with all members, which is what you came
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you came to Zoom was really our first
guest speaker to our monthly meetings,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was pretty badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are just raving about that show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a great group, too, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of passionate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's the four light
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing four lights,
you're passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about money anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a beautiful thing seeing people
really growing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: four lights or even one light,
you know, in a four by four.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that's where the greatest
innovation comes from, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, at the same time,
we were working with some of the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: farms on the planet, literally by
definition, and at the same time still
[SPEAKER_00]: doing one on one consulting calls for four
light growers, single tank growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times some of the most
interesting things of innovation are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from those little two by fours and
just, you know, nobody from the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that just comes up with a different angle
or some random product from their hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: store or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes a lot of the most
interesting things come from those smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in years past, our business was not
set up to help those smaller growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of some of the flak we
got from the living soil industry is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they thought we were just
helping some of the biggest farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which that is just what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I came from, you know,
some legitimate company back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, two of my cousins that are
like my brothers went on to be NASCAR crew
[SPEAKER_00]: chiefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not trying to be third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I want to be in the biggest
stadiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have the biggest impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do the coolest shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that took us to just some big
that's just what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but what I like now, we're still doing
those jobs, but now we've got a functional
[SPEAKER_00]: format for the smaller growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even now, hell, everybody's pinched on
money right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're helping some commercial farms
in our master classes because it's a minor
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of what our personal consulting
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we just had our first
student win a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been working with cup winners
since day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now just had our first student and he
won the Emerald Cup and he won a high
[SPEAKER_00]: times cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not which not sure which one,
but he just won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's for hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got I think about six thousand
square feet of greenhouse in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: His brand is called Stony Branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would have thought Illinois's,
you know, you know, it's not the last
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they grow good cannabis,
but it's not the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I have my friend Rick Mosca
for Mosca Negre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's there's people
crushing in Illinois and all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the trippy part about this last
couple of years, like they're popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the place, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'd never think, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, especially us from California,
you from the Bay, me from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically San Fernando Valley,
Orange County, San Diego, like some real
[SPEAKER_00]: players came from that zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to think, oh, someday someone
from Illinois is going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the highest THC tested autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some of my that have tested above
30 percent for auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is grown at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this is not an average,
but this is individual players testing
[SPEAKER_01]: above 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in Utah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would have thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought I'd end up in Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't been involved with any of
the farms around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a client from California that
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Utah is kind of it's like one of the
most good old boy places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of New York or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they assigned like nine or 12
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our client got like 15th out of I
think they only signed nine or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they're all hydroponic farms,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they awarded any organic
farms at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of interesting how that works
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like living here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the weed sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do so we do so much zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so high profile, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I'm terrified to light my house up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will never not have a plant in my
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never, never.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always you know, it's like I made
some seeds in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I just like having plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've scalped all kinds of bedrooms
to keep going in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we lived in northern California,
I was able to do the first full term
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor, which was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only done three outdoor runs because
I only lived there for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is the snitch state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be real careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't even talk about smoking weed
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I'm doing chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a chicken coop and I'm going to do
some selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm applying the principles of cannabis
to my chicken coop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, hopefully someday I'll be able
to sneak a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so I've only been here one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little nervous, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to go some CBG or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just out of the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go 12 footer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live up against the mountain and we get
legitimate like 70 mile an hour winds come
[SPEAKER_00]: off the mountain into the back of our
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we set up a garden that blows down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ordered I ordered a little two by two
light for Sarah and we're going to set up
[SPEAKER_00]: a little tomato inside the kitchen by the
front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to grow a tomato plant for
inside because that poor Sarah that
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor garden just keeps blowing down the
street like we can't even hardly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see the industry in the next
five years and in the next 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: From what aspect?
[SPEAKER_01]: From where we're at now, from where we
were before to where we're at now,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as companies quality, where do you
see the genetics going?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think more people will be going to
scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to have less indoor and more
greenhouse supplemental lighting,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I kind of think is the perfect
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love I love light greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with a lot of indoor growers and
it's hard to say how long economically
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to pan out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some brands that will
always be around regardless of economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked with some of those grows
that their brand will carry on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this one guy, Sam, he's the lead
cultivator of a farm in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're the largest permit holder
in northern California, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said his analytic team made the
claim that here in the next year or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only flower in the state of California
that's going to maintain an eighth price
[SPEAKER_00]: over $50 will be a living soil grown aside
from the cookies, you know, those handful
[SPEAKER_00]: of brands that will always maintain that,
which is pretty interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've done a lot of economics for
all types of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what I do for my
consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I also have a business degree
and the weed knowledge, so I'm able to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: at the table with the grower and the
business guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of spreadsheet analytics,
forecasting, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know all the economics, the cost of
production and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back in 2018, everybody was
kind of saying or even really 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, a lot of people were kind of
professing you need to be below 600,
[SPEAKER_00]: below 400 all in cost per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in like 2018, people were still like
890, 900, 720, you know, nowhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can get that with any
cultivation style, but you have to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I see shaking out is
regardless of your growing hydroponics or
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of your growing living soil,
if you're not data driven in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you still need to be an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need to be the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not measuring your process,
I don't think you're going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're legacy or legal,
because it's getting down to and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: having this conversation yesterday with
one of my classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, when pounds were four
thousand dollars, you could afford to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: a crop down if it went sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could afford to scrub a room down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could afford to shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could afford to not look at your
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, nailed it on the
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could afford to not even care about
financials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say this in the most loving way
possible, but most of us were very sloppy
[SPEAKER_00]: financial, myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I still barely manage my finances the
way I should, even though that's part of
[SPEAKER_00]: my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, helping people keep their money
straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis made me sloppy with my
profitability, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not, I think, at a basic
level, if you start with all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: you can quantify, if you're not analyzing
what you're feeding every harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to make it
because you don't know why things go
[SPEAKER_00]: sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know why things go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody comes to me, it's usually when
things aren't going well and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: start taking a data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, OK, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now have a numerical assessment of not
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things are going well, you need to
analyze that so that you can at least get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I learned what these
targets were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, things are going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's send an analysis of our
fertilization recipe to Wallace Labs,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, in El Segundo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they provide the most accurate
assessment of a fertilization recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's organics or water
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think at bare minimum, you need to be
doing regular water chemistry tests
[SPEAKER_00]: because your water changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Denver, Colorado, half the year,
your water is a six point two and comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from a certain water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part of the year, it's eight point
four and comes from another water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're pouring the same mils per gallon
of your advanced nutrients or whatever in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you're going to have one good part
of the year and one bad part of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: in a really simple fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: More important than that, no matter how
much you like your products, they vary
[SPEAKER_00]: quite wildly sometimes throughout the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of the analytics I do are for
products, helping them be more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now, Athena's really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Athena's really popular simply
because they're doing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to produce a higher
quality and I don't even necessarily care
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that's why people are jumping
on it and having a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Athena's doing a little bit more
due diligence, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other good brands too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CES I think has been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an extremely data-driven guy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other brands that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff might be a 300%
variation in what's in that bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I like Cutting Edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of Cutting Edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of United.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Emerald Harvest, as far as
organic, I think they have interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: products for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not married to any one product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sponsored by anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take endorsement money.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think that even needs to be
said with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just talk about a cost of
production standpoint, so some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger hydroponic farms that I've worked
with, they come in running Heavy 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: running Advanced, running... What was the
other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The San Fernando Valley guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can picture the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of the name right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, in 2018, that stuff was $3.50
a square foot nutrient input cost per
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things have gone up 40 to 50 to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say in 2023, if you're running
Heavy 16, Advanced,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those, you're probably three,
four, maybe $5 a square foot nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: input cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know CES is a little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you talk about general hydroponics,
you're probably $2.50 per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using Florapro, I think Florapro
is a little cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using some salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Florapro is actually a pretty good product
if we're talking something that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: two-part, that's a salt mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it for seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically will try anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for seed production,
I love trying different things and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of results I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit the mark the other day when we
harvested at over 45,000 seeds per four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four, which is... That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back when I started, if you would have
told me those are the kind of numbers we
[SPEAKER_01]: could get, I would have really strived a
lot harder to get those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the four-minute mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody strove for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know it was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best part about
legalization and it brought stuff out into
[SPEAKER_00]: the open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it gave people something to
chase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all those little pockets of
dudes crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you got to be able to put it on
Instagram, I think it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: four-minute mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not measuring these things,
you're going to struggle to stay relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're well-financed or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I do is I help
transition people from bottles to just bag
[SPEAKER_00]: salt formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go from like three,
four or five dollars a square foot down to
[SPEAKER_00]: a dollar a square foot and get the same
production or sometimes better if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing the NP&K and all that stuff,
living soil comparatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my full program pushed to the max,
pushing industry leading quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a dollar, dollar 20 square
foot all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you compare that to the absolute
lowest price bag salt, which is about a
[SPEAKER_00]: buck right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're two, three, four dollars a
square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to take very long for
living soil to get a significant advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: over that just from your reoccurring
costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it pays for itself, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like over time, absolutely pays for
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your investment is initial, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in your soil and then as you go,
it gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both can be managed though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like if you're in that two,
three, four dollars a square foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably better take a look at that
moving into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, you can't afford to
have one fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need to know why you had a 20%
loss on this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know why that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years from now, where do you see the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: My honest answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the only people still able to
cultivate, whether it's legacy or
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated, are those people that are
incorporating the available analytic tools
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tools to guide your cultivation
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying we're not going to be
artists anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying the cultivator is not the
best thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm saying if you're not analyzing
your water, if you're not analyzing your
[SPEAKER_00]: feed every time you buy nutrients,
you just will not make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think and I don't I think just that's a
broad statement that if you're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're in hydroponics and
you're not measuring volumetric water
[SPEAKER_00]: content, you're going to get smoked by the
people that are absolutely smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can buy a little handheld meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to buy some like crazy
growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy a handheld meter just like a
pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the living soil world, you're not
even you're not going to make it if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not analyzing, if you're not paying
attention to soil chemistry numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the people that are producing soil
aren't hitting the numbers for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not paying attention to the
biology, the biological numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have slow growth,
poor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with all the tools that are
available to now, you know, even
[SPEAKER_00]: Trollmaster, Growlink, Arroyo,
like things have changed in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I like with these Foslites and the
Growlinks and just all these analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, man, it's got me scratching,
trying to light up another room,
[SPEAKER_00]: just be like, I want to use these tools,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying you got to go spend a
bunch of money to be productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not starting with a 90
dollar water test or even Logan Labs can
[SPEAKER_00]: do a 40 dollar water test, if you're not
starting there, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to build a foundation to remain
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've worked with straight up
famous people, you know, like to no names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if you're famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if you're running a two by
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sixty eight dollars soil test always
comes back in profitability and yield in a
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people look at these numbers
like an obstacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the cost of doing
business as an obstacle, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to make it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to you have to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying blow money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing we're great at as
we guys are just like throwing money at
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like if you look at from a scarcity
mindset that your pie is shrinking and you
[SPEAKER_00]: say I get this every day, I can't afford a
sixty eight dollar water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you as somebody with a finance
degree that does economics for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, that return on
investment comes out of a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in any size commercial
facility and you're not doing that every
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, you're not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get blown by the people
that are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those people are new
entrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I come from these
pedigrees and there's less and less people
[SPEAKER_00]: with experience as I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bums me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is this market is going to
move on with or without you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're stuck in this position,
unwilling to move to this next requirement
[SPEAKER_00]: of you, you're going to get left behind
regardless of who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that goes for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you are where you are,
because in your world, you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the most data driven hydro
dudes I've met.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one other guy I can think of
that does similar type things to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would be considered world famous
like you, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of other people that
good get good at managing genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: managing process, managing employees,
having a good out, having a good market
[SPEAKER_00]: far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your strategy is to ship it to
Virginia, like that market is shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You maybe got one more year for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that like that's wrapping up pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just simply because I think that
goes back to the Eagle 20 talk of why that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the consumers tired of ringing ears,
tingling tongues and burning throats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the legacy growers are still
laying on the Eagle 20 avid and
[SPEAKER_00]: fluoromite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consumers over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that's the product you're
producing, not that many people want that
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to pay thirty five
dollars in taxes for an eighth or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the hell it is right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't make your ears ring,
doesn't make your tongue tingle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if if you are a legacy grower
that's trying to continue moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to find out what's wrong
nutritionally as to why you need that
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the regulated market,
we figured that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's math, it's nitrogen levels,
it's calcium quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pushing potassium so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need that stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got you got to put down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, to be fair, what I said earlier,
that information is very hard to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just Google this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sympathetic to that obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't know it before I knew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to put in the work,
you know, or reach out or reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I help I help nobody's all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people that nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you're watching this and
you don't know the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil as far as why it's a better
product, it's the it's the end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, it's the effect more than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the effect from the living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take two cultivars, grow one with
cocoa, and you're going to get good
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow skittles in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow any of these cultivars that are
popular right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get good results in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the effect hands down, I mean,
I think flavor wise, you can get good
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get great flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the effect and the effect and the
flavor, you know, and the structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's, you know,
there's something special about living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and the way it cures out,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different than stuff that's
grown in other substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the main difference for that is
and what I would, you know, what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute to as the greatest advantage
when you compare just hydroponics to any
[SPEAKER_00]: type to living soil, as the as the market
moves forward, I think the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage is while hydro is flushing,
I'm still feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't flush in living soil because
in hydroponics, you're taking a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: that takes a salt and sticks it to a
mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called chelate or chelate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard word to think of the context.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, they have they have to stick
that nutrient to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stick it to a salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you water that plant with that
salt based fertilizers, both those go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and then towards the end of the
harvest cycle, you got to take that salt
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know that just the salt
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're pulling things back out in
order to get that clean burning flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't contribute anything that
needs to be flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a good idea to flush in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create a whole nother problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in those several weeks,
while people are flushing, we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's where that added
complexity comes from and where those,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, whatever the stuff that pops up
on the test and things we haven't even
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out how to measure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the one single one of the
one of the main single advantages,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, other than stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're doing with living
soil and you're quantifying these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're not paying attention
to the microbial population, it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: a shit show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that extra buffer as far as a
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get buffer from soil as opposed to
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can do some great things in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not at all, you know, like I said,
I'm working with a 30,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell facility right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I've been in the kitchen and in the
laundry room of all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I can see what's
potential and what's problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I've doubled down so
hard on living soil is just on the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're managing these things,
it doesn't even exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in our consulting work,
we do four month packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most farms get to the point of no powdery
mildew in that first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them takes a little bit longer
into the second harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they understand what we're
teaching them and they implement it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: has that effect, even after we leave years
after the powdery mildew doesn't come back
[SPEAKER_00]: because they continue to manage for those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another tremendous advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't have a powdery mildew
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't spray nothing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't try to control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use math and microscope assessments to
stay out of the realms of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in hydroponics, you can do that as
well, but it has to do with nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and calcium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think most people aren't aren't
really doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I really enjoy the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a math nerd, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if people want to hear more about
what you're doing and follow follow your
[SPEAKER_01]: footsteps or check everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make it so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I zoom all day long, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things with COVID is I had to
become a virtual assistant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, but my website's CrestedSoil
.org.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, coming out of legacy markets,
I was stoned one day and pick a hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: spell, hard to write word, thinking that'd
make me hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had no clue by that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already had audio thumbprints of us
all logged in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but anyways, my personal email
is Scott at CrestedSoil.org if you got a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we do consulting for any size
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with foreign governments,
famous dudes, people you've never heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of, two by four hobbyist growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just like growing cannabis,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like I like to see people have that
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't care if you're a hydro
grower or living soil grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when it clicks in you and we
change one minor thing and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just like something really
cool about that where it just clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my favorite thing to hear people
say is I've been growing this many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that from my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite, favorite thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that through nutritional
management, hydroponics, measuring your
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate and hydroponics, or just living
soil in general done right does that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're getting ready to fire off
another master class today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, June 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think next Friday, our next master class
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do those a few times a year where we
take people through our consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a mineral chemistry class coming
up in July where I teach people the math
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to do their own mineral chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're a consultant or a hobbyist
grower or a farm, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have everybody in between in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mineral chemistry is one of the
biggest lacks in all of living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a handful of dudes that are
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, one of my main goals right now
is get way more people equipped to
[SPEAKER_00]: professionally and properly manage mineral
chemistry of their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's a major issue in the whole
industry, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously we do the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife teaches a microscope class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing we've been teaching
the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, 2014, I started teaching organic
growers how to use the microscope for
[SPEAKER_00]: their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife Sarah now teaches a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about five weeks long, lasts for an
entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have five in-person sessions and
monthly meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she basically sets you up through Zoom
on how to use the microscope as an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical tool, which I think if you're
any soil-based system, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating the microscope assessment in
any way, this is not likely to be fruitful
[SPEAKER_00]: for you moving into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get on that, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about that a little bit
more about what you guys do under the
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think a lot of people are
curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly as what you guys are doing under
the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we use what's called a compound
light microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two main types of microscope,
a stereo, which you look down like to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for bugs on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use one where light shines through the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put a cover slip and look for bugs
like in science class in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Lane Ingham is the person that
kind of took these scientific tools and
[SPEAKER_00]: turned it into an agricultural assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she all through the 90s, early 2000s,
I think by 1997, 2003, she had it dialed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gotten a lot of flack and a lot of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying everything that she says
right, but I would put her at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: my list of influential people in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I became qualified to guide commercial
farms because of her guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: She taught me how to be a professional
analyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: She taught me how to manage cultivators,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was good at growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically working one-on-one with her
taught me how to be a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to truly guide people to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using the microscope method to keep it
to a data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite saying is we got to move it
off of the emotion and onto a data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we take the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're counting bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're counting oxygen loving aerobic,
what I would say, beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're comparing those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the predators of
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're counting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we count nematodes, beneficial
and non beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we would call the anaerobic
indicators or decreased oxygen organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like a light switch that turns
on in biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very specific functions under
certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when oxygen drops below four parts per
million, a whole suite of organisms go to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep and go to endormin stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a whole bunch of other organisms
wake up and start functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That transition is where all disease takes
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about pythium,
fucerium, rhizoctonial, I don't even care
[SPEAKER_00]: about the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means you're on this side of decreased
oxygen and you need to address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's basic patterns inside these
different organism ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a major project in 2018 in Santa
Barbara after the major fires and floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a one acre greenhouse full of
30 gallon pots of moms where some had
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew and some did not have
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through each 2200 square foot bay
and we counted all the soil from plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that didn't have powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we counted all the soils from plants
that were showing visible signs of powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through all 16 of those bays, there was a
pattern within 4% of a certain ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ratio between what we call omicids,
which are water molds, powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: causing basically molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that are oxygen loving aerobic
organisms, there was about a 4% to 6%
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in that ratio in the plants
that showed powdery mildew and those that
[SPEAKER_00]: did not show powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pattern continues to be the most
undeniable, consistent thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if you're growing in
Zimbabwe, in the ground or in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California in a back bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between this thing we
call omicids and beneficial fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: determines most of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your threshold for powdery mildew
so that's basically how we use that
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for patterns, we're looking
for quantities and there's certain ranges
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say where good things
happen and there's certain ranges where
[SPEAKER_00]: all the problems happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're doing with a
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been growing at a smaller scale
and you now go to this any larger scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes massive scale with the most
stringent constraints ever devised for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cultivation, not even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you and I are doing in regulated
cannabis is the most stringent production
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants on the planet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand, not even close,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most stringent would be GMP weed
for the European market, which has even
[SPEAKER_00]: stricter parameters in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is one of the strictest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're entering that activity,
you need to be precise, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we do is we chop up the
facility, do a bunch of biological
[SPEAKER_00]: assessments, and instead of spraying for
powdery mildew every plant, every week,
[SPEAKER_00]: we say zone four is out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's address zone four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically help people identify where
their vulnerabilities are through
[SPEAKER_00]: biological means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually making those slight
corrections changes most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started really getting into
the commercial markets in late 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2017, the only thing that I did was
biological assessment and corrections
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was not at all about to profess
that I knew what to do in these 600 light
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had a great legacy, but I'm not
going to try and tell people what to do at
[SPEAKER_00]: that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only did microscope assessment and
made suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, obviously, we do full design and the
whole whole everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, all we were doing was
biological assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that were respected,
well-known, when you tuned up that
[SPEAKER_00]: biological thing right off the bat,
you get 30 to 40 percent more of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get 30 to 40 percent faster growth
rates, which led to a week less of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative time across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get 30 to 40 percent increase in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd also get 30 to 40 percent increase
in potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these combinations would translate to
also 30 to 40 percent reduction in costs
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not fighting problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making more yield, increasing
profit, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're never going to convince me that
biology is not worth measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main driver of what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we do, we've termed it the
corrective method for cultivation simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're doing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing is any decision we
make, if it affects that biological
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment negatively, it's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been all kinds of things along the
way that I was like, this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those biological numbers go down or in
some other ways sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a popular trend, we put it to the
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes down, it's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how popular it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and that's why I think the
microscope stuff gets so much resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot of people trying to
push stuff that's not that helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 40 minutes of a microscope
assessment, you could see if that was good
[SPEAKER_00]: or bad or, you know, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically what we're doing with
the microscope assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see every thing like my
favorite example is the very first
[SPEAKER_00]: facility that ever brought us in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was early 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had five benches in a greenhouse and
they had four greenhouses identically
[SPEAKER_00]: mirrored.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd bring plants in on a conveyor belt
going from right to left each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd bring in new plants and all four
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two outer sides were producing
significantly more than the three inner
[SPEAKER_00]: rows and they were banging their head
against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even from the same
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, just whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each of these four greenhouses
measurable yield increase on outside two
[SPEAKER_00]: rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got less as they got towards the
center in the middle row had the least
[SPEAKER_00]: production, regardless of what week it
came in or what greenhouse it was in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my wife and I went in there,
did about 30 microscope assessments of the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dice it up this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dice it up this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remarkable variation in biological
populations from corner to corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: from group to group that were identical in
each greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what was happening was they
would have a batch tank in the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: each greenhouse with a big hose reel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once a week they would get their
predatory nematodes, which are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial feeding nematodes, which produce
growth and they cycle nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the HB nematodes, Heterabditis,
nematodes that we use for thrips and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they're commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's SF, SC and HB.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HB one actually eats bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short increases growth,
even though you think you're doing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: control gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would dump those nematodes
into the tank in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nematodes are heavier than water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go straight to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump is drawing from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heaviest thing goes to the first
place they water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So us cannabis people like to do
everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would walk into greenhouse one,
they would stretch out the hose,
[SPEAKER_00]: go up and water the far left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the hose is completely stretched
out, they go to the far right over here
[SPEAKER_00]: and water that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wheel up the hose a little bit,
hit this lane, hit this lane, wheel up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more and hit the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ends up happening is you end up with
a billion nematodes over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a billion nematodes over here,
you know, a third of a billion here and
[SPEAKER_00]: none in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with track and trace data,
as much as people want to groan and moan
[SPEAKER_00]: and complain about it, that is extremely
efficient data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time ever growers were
forced to get a per plant yield is
[SPEAKER_00]: undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a mashing of an average
light yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this corner is producing more than
this corner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we did was
use that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a commercial cultivator,
you should take that track and trace data,
[SPEAKER_00]: make an overlay of your facility and place
the plant data and the yield and color
[SPEAKER_00]: code it where it's located in your
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will bring up a heat map of
dysfunction in your facility and tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly where the problems are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I because I didn't get asked for too
much stuff until a certain point of
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally someone goes,
what do you think we should do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I give my right arm for some
organization of this track and trace data
[SPEAKER_00]: that's everybody's complaining about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a computer guy and he's like,
well, what would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, put it where it belongs
and color code it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, all right, about a week
or so later, he produced two maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: One had per four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: One had per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And colored it red, yellow and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And green was basically what it shook down
of what they needed for a yield to be
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was roughly 60 pounds per thousand
square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break that down into however many four by
fours you got and then color code it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's remarkable patterns that reveal
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we start to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular facility,
we hadn't done that analytics yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did the microscope assessment and
every single greenhouse had the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did was change their method
for delivering those beneficial nematodes
[SPEAKER_00]: into a smaller container, a little squirt
bottle and put them directly into the beds
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all yields leveled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one single change, which was
basically nothing, we didn't change
[SPEAKER_00]: anything except for the way they're
distributing the nematodes leads to a 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in yield because now everything's
performing the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most cultivators are like, man,
they all say the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if you're hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're living soil, a big or small.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just get another 20%,
if I could just get another 30%,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes if I get another 40%,
that, that percentage increase that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator is desiring is always in
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if everything performed as your good
performers, you would find that 20 to 40%
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, but cultivators don't know how
to look for that variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically what we do is teach you
how to identify that variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in living soil, it's through
microscope assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hydroponics, it's water delivery rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do in hydroponics is you get
some one liter pitchers or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go diagonally across your bed,
your, you know, one in this corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: one in the middle, one in this corner,
do that on a tray, do that on the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger your irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in one single facility that had
equal distribution of liquid from corner
[SPEAKER_00]: to corner, one single facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in some guys from the San
Fernando Valley affiliated with Rappers
[SPEAKER_00]: doing big things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just, one of the dudes from the
Valley was good at plumbing and he built a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad-ass system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he got to the bigger scale,
continued building bad-ass systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us cannabis growers build
atrocious irrigation systems at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're dumping sometimes 200,
300, 400, 500% variation in fertilization
[SPEAKER_00]: to different plants, that variation is
where the bugs start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overwatered ones, sometimes they
get the bugs, the underwater ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they get the bugs, the ones that
are Goldilocks are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you need to trim your irrigation
system to get at least reasonably
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one change will get you that 30%
yield because now everything's doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to come by, check out our facility
and see what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I feel like, as I said, one of three
extremely data-driven people I've met in
[SPEAKER_00]: my journey, I'm sure your shit's dialed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little while here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, we got hit by a semi truck in
February.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really shook our world up and we're
still kind of recovering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really up for road trips for a
minute because the last, the last site
[SPEAKER_00]: visit we were doing, we got smoked by a
semi truck in a snowstorm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I still, still a little shook up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting better and everything will
be fine, but I'm still a couple months out
[SPEAKER_00]: from a road trip, but as soon as I'm
ready, yeah, I would love to come see what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I really appreciate you coming
on the show today, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I look forward to having you back
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to do one in person when you
guys can make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll bring Sarah with me next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm just thankful to be around,
you know, I'd still probably be stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain if it wasn't for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traveled to cannabis in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even, I don't watch TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't watch the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know what coronavirus was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were like, brother, you better
leave tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you're tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, you need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went home, checked my hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our tickets were canceled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got one of the last tickets out of
that country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not, I would have been one of the
people stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still eternally grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my honeymoon too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would have been stuck in a hostel in
Spain or some shit if it wasn't for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: for my honeymoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least I got to get home and make
something worth of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, dude, eternally grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I just have a lot of respect
for the way you conduct yourself in this
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not saying that you were
perfect, but there were certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they did that were non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're one of like three dudes I've
met in my journey that maintains that same
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos, creed, and code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, anything I can do to help your
journey, you let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there even is anything I
can do, but anything I can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: reciprocate you saving me from getting
stuck in Spain during a world shutdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got your back, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I just have a lot of respect
for how you move through the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a lot of people,
especially in the breeding world,
[SPEAKER_00]: that do some kooky stuff and, you know,
they're not real and transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I ever have anybody that needs a
bunch of seeds, there's one name I call is
[SPEAKER_00]: James.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, unless nobody else, you know,
and you, the few people I've sent your way
[SPEAKER_00]: have had nothing but good things to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I appreciate that because my
results a lot of times are dictated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I got bad genetics, I can only do so
much with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I got a hemp grower that gets a
bunch of hot hermy BS, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can trust that your auto
flowers are going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be some 1992
nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're real, you know, and people
can count on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still, I'm still trying to help
the push that auto flowers are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some crazy faces from people when I
recommend auto flowers, but I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that you've put in the work
and I hope that other people are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify it and recognize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you're going to be successful
just because of the way you move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason you're still around,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel the same way about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you and Sarah do amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think even with people
trying to put down living soil and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't yield, you know, there's no way
to do it at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have always been like,
no, this is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is what you, everybody
should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, if it's for you for sure,
but if not, but if not, I could still help
[SPEAKER_00]: you balance the rez.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep.
Whatever.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you coming on again and
say hi to the wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to having you guys come
on the show again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
