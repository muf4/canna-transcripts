[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, our special guest is Freddie Bigg
from Planta and SF Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Chris a couple of episodes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got me too lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got too lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical cannabis Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us how you guys started in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think an avid smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was an avid avid smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I got into the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that I am pretty passionate
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has been a large portion of my life
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I started smoking very young,
very young.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I started smoking like consistently,
like around 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started being, I feel like a real
smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I kind of fucked with it in my
younger ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the time I was 20, we were smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were into martial arts, wrestling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fought MMA, I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I fought 71 as a pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I competed in mixed martial arts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrestled in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was high school American.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I did spend a lot of time playing
sports and athletics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smoking and training.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was training, well, when I trained
for wrestling, I didn't really smoke that
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was the stigma,
but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I did know some people that
did smoke and have good success.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was fighting, I was smoking a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Diaz brothers kind of showed us all
the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoke a lot, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say Nick and Nate, those are some
certified smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I love training with Nate Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some gyms don't really care for you
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Diaz Academy, you know,
put out your joint before you get on the
[SPEAKER_02]: mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty chill about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I did dig that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I train with CJ Levique right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a super heavyweight now.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's 315.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he went to Liberty, maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we trained UFC.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does not smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knocks people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knocked a couple of decent people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hits hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding pads for that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fun to train with, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he does a lot of gyms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the fight community is a small
community, a small tight-knit community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of respect for anybody who has
the audacity to put it all on the line and
[SPEAKER_02]: get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I trained at Dragon House 20
years ago.
Dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zang?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Zong Lao.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zong is a character.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zong is a character, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon House, they've been putting on cool
events in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keys are a pavilion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been to a couple in there,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, his school back in the day was a lot
different than it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Kung Fu, but it was still a lot
different back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot different, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot different back then, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, San Francisco, smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always used to be able to smoke in San
Francisco on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Francisco, I feel like I lived in San
Francisco in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like as far as embracing
cannabis, no city embraced cannabis as
[SPEAKER_02]: early and as much as San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the first places where it
was accepted to walk down the street
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of other places,
you know, people were worried about going
[SPEAKER_02]: to jail for smoking weed in San Francisco
and walking past cops smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like San Francisco has embraced
cannabis for such a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: for such a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I remember Blowfish Sushi back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to drive out to Blowfish and smoke
on the on the stoops and then wait for our
[SPEAKER_00]: reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just smoking peas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoners are peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not killing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's no harm, no bad
intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me your earliest memory of a good
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like one of my really
good childhood friends, my brother was the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed dealer when I was younger in high
school and he was the guy who had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was around some really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, yeah, as far as like my
friends circle, my peer group,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my best friends had the best weed
and was the guy who was the weed guy for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude went to prison for six ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different world back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, you know, these new age
trappers got a little soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was it was big penalty going to
jail before when we were doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot riskier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of riskier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were scary times for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had pagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have all the access.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how funny someone was just talking
about pagers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't think I ever trapped off
a pager.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm old, but not that old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never trapped off the pager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there was codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a wild, wild time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grew up in the Bay Area then?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Fairfield, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever see Capis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the legendary Capis.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big topic on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that super dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it had like almost a yellowish tone
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely some wreaked like ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, ammonia, you know, and I think
there's multiple Capis as we talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there was anything with
ammonia was Capis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay Area Capis was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that was the East Bay thing
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Capis was very, very East
Bayish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: In San Francisco, we didn't get the piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I go to the town in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody had the piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like one of the first real zah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The champelli and the piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pelli.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was that old school zah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's the one that really made
me fall in love with the Capis because you
[SPEAKER_00]: could smoke it down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could fire it up the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sixty dollars an eighth back then was a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be like over a hundred today,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that stony indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that stare at your shoelaces type
indica strong high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could get you high if you smoked it
any time of the day, night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't matter what your tolerance was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong, strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the lineage on that was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights times Super Silver times
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's long gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remaking it, you know, that's going to
be we're doing a documentary this year on
[SPEAKER_00]: it and we're working on versions of Capis
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those versions are lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not getting those back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along the way, you might find
something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what we're trying to
explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say you might find something
better, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say something's better than
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say something's better
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a matter of opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Zetopia better than the
Skittles or Skittles better than Zetopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends who markets it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends who grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who grew it has a large portion of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some some really legendary strains
have lost their allure because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: been grown by poor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Skittles is one of those ones that
people struggle to grow good Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of people that can grow
good Skittles and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even the one percent of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's such a it's such a fickle
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Skittles market is such a fickle
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a unique such a unique oddity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I think that it still
sells in its green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the bud structure is not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have color.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not along the lines of any other
contemporary strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like I was blessed to have
Skittles 2017 I think is when I started
[SPEAKER_02]: getting Skittles from a grower from
Humboldt who had who had the real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real candy tarty Skittles cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I tried it around June 10th of I
don't remember exactly of 2014 was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time I tried it in the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously like, you know,
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I see the the grower was really
proud of the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like maybe a B plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the grower was very offended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, he's like, you got to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit the joint and it had intense flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, this is really
unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor on this is really, really
special, really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the high was intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, this might be
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bag of pill is definitely not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag of pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't have the bag of pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does not have the bag of pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of guys, you know, you guys have
Skittles that's sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't have Skittles that's
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a dry feel to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about the SF Kana group,
we do a lot of things that other people
[SPEAKER_02]: are able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say those dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SF Kana cultivation team is a really
talented team that has a lot of diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they can grow Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can grow candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can grow cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can grow in different mediums.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can grow in different lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like those dudes are really great
at their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really great at their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of things that most people
can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the yield they're getting on the
Skittles is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yield, the quality, like that's the
shit people don't believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so getting three pounds plus a
Lipe on Skittles is unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing it at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing it at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, when they grow a small scale,
they can get quality like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you scale up past 100 lights or
perhaps 500 or 1000 lights, it's really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's levels to the shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely levels to the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's why I was on a past
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about, you know,
there's small growers with big egos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's small growers who have under,
you know, smaller canopies and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: it dialed in and then they feel like
they're great at their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's other teams that are
doing it over a large scale, which makes
[SPEAKER_02]: it a totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to get quality at larger
scales is, you know, a skill not many
[SPEAKER_02]: groups are capable of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your favorite thing to smoke
right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're smoking 11 coffins right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a 400 seed hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Planted cannabis company, L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: based cannabis company that I'm partnered
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cultivator is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that he's dedicated a lot of
space to finding new flavors and new
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been popping around 200 seeds a
month.
[SPEAKER_02]: This seed, this was a 500 seed seed,
400 of which was this RS 11 cross with
[SPEAKER_02]: Coffin County.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bred by Duke of Urb, Duke of Doja,
a really close friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rusty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a large seed and you know,
it's hard to pheno hunt, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the pallet and I get to, you know,
help select.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to select that many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember what the total was,
but I know it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it might have been 70, 70 to assess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like the cultivator grows
out 400 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: X amount are going to be male.
[SPEAKER_02]: X amount of plants aren't like are going
to get crossed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get a sample of the ones that
are viable, viable, you know, keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't remember how many it was,
but it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you have to do it in a
timely fashion because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivator is devoting space to
keeping all these plants alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the 70 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to get through them in a
timely manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you can only smoke and fairly
assess so many before your pallet gets
[SPEAKER_02]: burnt out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it was a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pallet fatigue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say like I would like to say it's a
rough job, but like smoking like a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: new flavors all week long isn't the worst
job ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So but and this was actually number 178.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see a lot of strains are
like number four, number seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is this is we call it 11 coffins
and this is number 178 out of 400.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one right here, it's really dope
when you see all the phenos because you
[SPEAKER_02]: see different representations,
you see different characteristics get to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right here had the the RS 11 that
OZK gas had an even balance of the gas and
[SPEAKER_02]: the candy from the coffin candy because
coffin candy is another strain that's
[SPEAKER_02]: unique to us, but it's like a complex
candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 11 coffins yet had an even balance so
that you could taste the RS 11 type gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could taste the candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that like strains that do
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blend things people are familiar with,
you know, so and I think people want candy
[SPEAKER_02]: gas and I think this is really a true
candy gas sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's really complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some different textures and
layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like this one a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this one a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a Skittles back cross,
but it's it's Skittles back cross to
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles back cross to a strain called
Strawberry Scalato, which is a Scalato,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is Skittles by Gelato by a
strawberry diesel coffin cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're familiar with
coffin cut, but it tastes like a triple
[SPEAKER_02]: layer Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a triple Z that we've that's
probably the new strain that I'm most
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also did an afternoon pineapple,
which is a sativa dominant that had actual
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple flavor cross that to rent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a candy gas, but it's like a hazy
like it's like a hazy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say I'm more sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say it tastes like pineapple,
but it has a hazy sativa gas mixed with
[SPEAKER_02]: candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm really excited for that one as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about sativas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't be my first choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it would be my first choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that and I don't think that it's
really hard to see a true representation
[SPEAKER_02]: of any of the, you know, the sativa indica
labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to see like real true
definitions that aren't hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that there's like sativa
leaning plants that I would say probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not my favorite, probably not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't seen like a really true,
maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some Nimbus Nax is a newer
strain that's like, that's like has a hazy
[SPEAKER_02]: type vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that is definitely sativa
leaning that I really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grown by Humble Harvest in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're growing this Nimbus Nax
and it had like a hazy sativa gas,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was burning super clean,
super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think it would be my first
choice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember the super silver back in the
back in the day in San Francisco?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very familiar with super silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working with a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting a bunch of super silvers
from a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a 13 week or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's like a really, really longer
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a longer flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's shorter flowering versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the one that was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the dudes, I was working with a
group out of Pacifica a long time ago and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were growing super silver and I think
it was 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit takes forever when you're
waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like 15 weeks before batch to
batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 weeks back batch to batch out of like a
house grow that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did work with a group that had the
super silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it would like be tops as
far as what my power prefers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And customers these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess if you had good super
silver, anything will sell if it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like anything that has grown to
really good quality will sell except for
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack O'Rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like I feel like some of the
heady kids showed me the new cool shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, this is Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like some groups, I think
Lumpy's has an apple strain, but it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack vibes to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that like, yeah,
a couple of people was like, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: new hot shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is Jack, this is Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting to see because I feel
like a lot, you know, I feel like the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth of the matter that strains that are
marketed well do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, strains that are marketed really
well do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of those strains and I feel like
some really good strains that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: marketed well don't do well, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that marketing has a lot to do
with it, with the success of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: products, especially like if you're
comparing on an even playing field,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we have like, you know, 10,
10 flower compared to 10, 10 flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: whichever one is marketed better is going
to do the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the grass is greener where you
water it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think when you put the
marketing attention on top of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets a lot of presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a lot of presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just kind of is what it is
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, McDonald's and Nike, they're not
making better products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing more innovative marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big of a role do you feel social media
plays?
[SPEAKER_02]: How big of a role?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like social media plays a large
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that the social media
platforms have made it hard to market
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, but they're so normally used,
regularly used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that it's a large tool to
market on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's the very difficult tool
to market on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've been able to navigate it
relatively well, but it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_02]: nuanced space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know how to tiptoe around
Instagram without getting deleted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we've been deleted enough
times to kind of figure out what works and
[SPEAKER_02]: what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that social media does play a
large part, but I don't think that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be the future of cannabis
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the relationship with the
customer is the biggest thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: customer, you know, having their trust to
where they come back and they shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want SF Canna every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the definition of a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, that's the definition of a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brand is your promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if I have it, that's like
initially the definition of a brand is
[SPEAKER_02]: your brand is your promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like SF Canna, you know, we only,
I mean, I get the QC, we only put our name
[SPEAKER_02]: on X amount of quality so that that's our
promise that every time you smoke our
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, you're going to get something that's
beautiful potent and burning clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a bunch of SF Canna photos in my
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we went toward and we've done,
we've been done a bunch of work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the collaboration stuff and yeah,
you went through some of the cantaloupes
[SPEAKER_00]: phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like 90 some odd fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of all over the place with
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like they do an amazing job as
far as cultivation is concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as labeling the cuts and knowing
which flavor is which, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: say they mastered that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely, and I am blessed to test
all these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times I'm like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like number 647.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what are the genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I want to know all the stuff
and I feel like people want to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they want the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people want the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the story for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times I feel like the
cultivator cultivation team, that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: really on their radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're looking for how the,
how the weed grows, how the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, structure, how to make it taste
better, how to make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes they don't know the genetics
and I'm like, we got to know the genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: guys, guys, we got to know the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: James gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, but that's not the
genetics, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't market this as got this from
James.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like the, the line keeps
moving and the bar keeps moving up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the cultivation space is evolving at
such a fast pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're like the innovations
and quality and the yields and it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's evolving super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's evolving super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see people two years behind and
they just get further and further behind
[SPEAKER_02]: as, as everything starts to advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you see like some of the more
technologically advanced grows and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that focus on white ash getting,
you know, that's a whole nother animal
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't something that was really in
the conversation three or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like clean burning weed has all,
has been a lot part of the conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you didn't want your weed to burn
black and you wanted it to smoke well,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you identified that as the white
ash by ash color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the ash color was a box that
needed to be checked, but for the,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the weed to be flavorful and burning
clean was a box to be checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for it not to be a burning black has
been, has been, has been a thing for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that the science of white
ash has a totally been, been mastered.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's definitely some other
nuances that, that affect the color of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, you know, but as
baseline, typically if it's burning white,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's, it's clean, whether,
you know, it's interesting to see because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some of these more potent
strains that don't burn as clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if that has anything to do
with it, because I will say some,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of these, some of these strains that
are burning super white, aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily the most potent flavorful
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just burning white and people like
them because they're burning white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got flour that people were really
proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is burning really
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it got me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I'm not really tasting a lot of
flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overall experience, I would rate it
lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would rate it lower even
though it does have the white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the struggle to get it white all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's recipes that guys have
come up with where I feel like it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, but not everything is the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have Skittles versus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I'll say that I like to say,
maybe I'll take an unpopular stance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's guys that have master curing
curating white ash, but I still don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think that their flour is at the top of
the top of the heap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it always burns clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my opinion, it's not the best
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the end of the day, I'm all about
flavor and I'm all about effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two most important things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor and potency are really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor and potency are real important for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we used to get cat pissed back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the ugliest of ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we get shreds in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was still $60 for an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that made me realize how important
the other things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag appeal wasn't as important,
but you know, the brickweed was nasty back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't get good brickweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do a lot of brickweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: West and I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: No headaches for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking out of cans with seeds popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely hit out of a few cans here and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely smoked in some survival
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you think the future of the
industry is going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Global.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I was in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the market is going to
improve globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Germany just did some type of
decriminalization, legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, so now you got
Thailand, Germany and a host of other
[SPEAKER_02]: countries that are starting to become
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that are able to trade with
each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that global is the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that having a global footprint is
like essential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I was that's why I was in
Spain, because I would like to wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: market my brands globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been out to Thailand and seen the
scene out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not been out to Thailand,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was in Spain, everybody was in
Thailand for the full moon sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people that went out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard I've heard mixed mixed stories
of the market, but I think it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Thailand has been high on my list of
countries to visit for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as a fighter, I would like to go
there for the Muay Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, they have amazing food,
amazing fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like fruit and they have high,
you know, some of the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even call it organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how they're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food is in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Thailand is super high on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a ton of friends out there
I've been waiting to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy because, you know,
I base my travel whether we can smoke or
[SPEAKER_02]: not, since I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we smoke there or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Thailand was high on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was like, man, you can't before you
can smoke there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's more appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing the weeds are expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hearing forty five dollars a gram
for good weed out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, you know, the price for weed
in Barcelona was it was really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bring any.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dropped a bag on weed in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was buying a hundred dollar
ace every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes twice, sometimes twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they have good flour out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good extract out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got passionate people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is booming out in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, still, in my opinion,
it had amazing vibes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had amazing vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did feel very welcomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did like the culture of how they
chilled at the shops and smoked and you
[SPEAKER_02]: chilled there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll bring you, you know, smoking
accessories.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got papers and bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, you know, you can order
a latte.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can order a beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like food, snacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely like that vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's great where you can
smoke and you can hang out and chill in a
[SPEAKER_00]: public place where, you know, there's
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take cannabis over alcohol every
single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like sometimes, you know,
you get pulled into the bar because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a social norm in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I think there was there was
establishments where we could chill and
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke and have music and the same type of
vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would take that 10 times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's over alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I did like some of the
cafes in Spain are open till midnight,
[SPEAKER_02]: one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, you know, catch a vibe,
chill, smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to see the menus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hitting different shops,
seeing different menus, smoking the
[SPEAKER_02]: Spalli, the Cali Genetic Spanish Grown
Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the good stuff, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try any of the Spanish stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I tried a lot of local weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I would I feel very
blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, the power of social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I touched down, some local
growers hit me up and I was able and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: gifted a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about Spanish genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, well, that's the broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like what's broadly grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a lot of California strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they definitely want genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I love that they're
interested in popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, popping seeds is for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like the most profitable way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're like trying to make money,
popping seeds is not the way to make the
[SPEAKER_02]: most money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, but it's essential for like the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it has its own value.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inherent value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody can cash in on that value,
but it has definitely has a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and guys over there are now growing
better to where they can actually do good
[SPEAKER_00]: selections, because you have to grow a
certain level to do selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to really assess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to, yeah, to really have a good
representation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not growing well, you're going to
get a poor representation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about hasholes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hasholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a hashole all day guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I enjoy smoking really good
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't mind paying for really
good rosin, but I don't know if it's worth
[SPEAKER_02]: it to throw that hundred dollar a gram
rosin into the hashole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel I get that that pleasure out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather take a second wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'd rather roll a hashole in a
second wash than like some people are
[SPEAKER_02]: busting open these, you know, these jars
that are two hundred bucks a jar and
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing them in a hashole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's like beer bonging
champagne, you know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely people that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know if that's the way
that I want to enjoy my hundred dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: gram rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I used to have a friend that would
drink Erkinjerk, the ENJ pints of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put him in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the cat piss guy, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my Erkinjerk stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't put it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I hid it in my backpack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I was a little bit younger
when we were doing before I graduated to
[SPEAKER_02]: Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the Jack and Cokes with the
7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big, big gulps.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: All bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's better than the 40s,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mall liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mall Liquor just makes people look
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mall Liquor is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy that like St. Ides is the huge
cannabis infused drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I feel like the younger
generation isn't aware of like the St.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ides, Snoop Dogg, Mall Liquor 40
generation, because that's what I identify
[SPEAKER_02]: St. Ides as, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Crooked Eye type drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting to see that there are
St. Ides infused cannabis drinks that are
[SPEAKER_02]: really popular right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for St. Ides, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely cleaned up their image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these companies that are going to be
jumping towards cannabis, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the big companies are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's like that's just an
indication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like St. Ides, they're a large mall liquor
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're huge in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be more of that for sure,
especially as like federalization clears
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things become legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things become clearer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, yeah, the large money is definitely
going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's already coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sneaking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already dripping in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like just trickling in, not like,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, there's there's it's a big
industry and there's several sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the boutique, high end side of the
industry and then there's the large
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boutique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's so small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows a very small segment of
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not it's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not that's not there's nothing
wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people aren't going to enjoy,
you know, the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at alcohol, most people
aren't enjoying the finest wines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're getting somewhere middle
to bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what most most cannabis
consumers are consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are those people that really,
really, you know, search for the search
[SPEAKER_02]: for the best and seek that out and enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because it's always,
you know, it's funny in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily like the the
financial levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know how you say it,
but like, I feel like some people with
[SPEAKER_02]: meager means smoke the best way to smoke
the best weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sacramento, I feel like it's a
median income city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sacramento, they're smoking amazing weeds
in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like there's some people I know
with a bunch of money and they just smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst cheaters.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word rich people smoke the worst weed
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I mean, I guess it just shows
what some people are passionate about and
[SPEAKER_02]: what's important to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's great when passion drives
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think the other thing is
collecting data points over time really
[SPEAKER_00]: determines how much you like weed or don't
like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you smoke a lot, then you realize
what's good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke very rarely, then it's kind
of all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to really assess it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after 20 years or 15 years or
whatever, you really get a good if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you tried a bunch of stuff, you can really
have a more broader, broader palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A broader palette, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with cannabis, you can go in any
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's so many different
flavors out there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like whatever direction you want
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berries, strawberries, blueberries,
raspberries, acai berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely infinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of subtleties at the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about the subtleties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of nuances in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of reasons why things can't
be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like people are always like if we
can mix this strain and that strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to get and it's never like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, you know, we cross this
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost never like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's mostly never like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, you get lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: 400 phenols later, you find one that
matches what you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of recessive traits in
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trying to breed for
specific stuff, unless you're reinforcing
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits, if you're just creating F1s,
you don't know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know your lines,
you don't know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more you breed, the more you work
with the plants, you kind of know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities are.
[SPEAKER_02]: What what what characteristics are going
to come out and how heavily each one's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to come out is just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's when you see large
when you see a bunch of different phenols.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's like common characteristics
in all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are, you know, I think it's just
like kids like, you know, you have five
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all got the same eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all some are tall,
some are small.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's it's similar with
when you do large phenol hunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain base characteristics that
you can see in a large portion of the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just different how how much of
that comes out is is is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really that's really one of
the most interesting things from phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting that I found is like is that,
yes, there's base characteristics that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see in all these strains that have
like come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look for the one that were
the characteristics that you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for comes out the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the unicorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's how and there's the what
the fuck is this right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yes, all these look the same,
about the same, about the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, oh, what the fuck is
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck are this?
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the fun ones, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The funky ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, OK, you know, and I think
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're selecting keepers,
you're like, OK, I like this one because
[SPEAKER_02]: this character stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this one because these
characteristics stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to rerun this one because it
grew so well, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, but some of them are like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, it's hard to assess
whether that's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard to hard to it's hard
to forecast what people are going to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, until you smoke it, you don't really
know if it's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some people miss on that that
note when they're going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, at the end of the day,
it's all about smoking and finding out the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and the taste, because sometimes it
just doesn't translate on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most amazing, beautiful,
smelly thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you grow it out and smoke it or
you dry it out and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not a totally different
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, I think that's why
it's important to have a team or like
[SPEAKER_02]: people with diverse skill sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that like my plant, the
cultivation partner is an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator and he knows a lot of the
characteristics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, yes, he drives the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to smoke the flower and assess it
and see like from a smoker's perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what I feel is about the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we come together and find
some really special things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in Sacramento to part time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the new Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beta LA to Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should be running the triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the new triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we played a game with Chris,
we're going to do this little game where I
[SPEAKER_00]: got three joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them are SF Kana and one of them is
not SF Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to guess which one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to guess which one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go ahead and dry hit them all
and then we'll fire them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to have fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is most likely something
that we grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is a maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just from the dry hit,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to fire it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just from the dry hit.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I feel like, OK, this one's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't grow this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow a lot of shit people don't get to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel very blessed to see it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this feels this one seems like a strain
that we're not known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: This feels like a like a glitter bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: A different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has something different in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like so my vote would be this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We I feel like we SF Kana, we have access
to most of the great contemporary genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: out there and we've grown them,
whether they work out for us is is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not always not always the case,
but we have access and grown some things
[SPEAKER_02]: because this tastes like a glitter bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: SF Kana, we're not a grown from glitter
bomb, but we grew some glitter bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did grow some glitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're two phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grew some glitter bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've grown some.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I think that but I would then I
have to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if I smoked a lot,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything smokes like SF Kana weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be my vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be my vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would one be the one that I want
to smoke the least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying that it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that like, you know, it's just
just a matter of preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would smoke the sweet one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would smoke the sweet one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, because when you say that
candy is really popular, people get mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I feel like I'm just going to say a
candy is the most in demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And flavor right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people get mad when you say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I don't control the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market controls the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The demand controls the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people like dessert flavor strains
and that's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy a really good gassy, biscotti,
carbon fiber type weed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the market right now,
they want color and then they want a
[SPEAKER_00]: candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something else with it,
you put candy gas, you can put.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got to be a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just got to be a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in the age of gelatos still.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the age of gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say some people say runs,
you know, but yeah, I mean, gelatos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the influence from the gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's, you know, the elbow is
connected to the to the wrist is connected
[SPEAKER_02]: to the finger type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, like if you look at it
that way, if you look at it as
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's gelato crosses, then you
could also say everything's cookie crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: because gelatos came from cookies,
which was the biggest wave or impact in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 2010, 2000 to 2012, it was the
biggest thing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least coming from the Bay,
there was still a lot of OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA just loved their OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, like that 2010 era,
I think that cushions had a nice little
[SPEAKER_02]: wave in the Bay where people wanted to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a classic Bubba Kush that had like
the really cushy structure at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic OG Kush was really in favor a
little bit in that 2010, 2012 range.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the cookies reigned dominant for
a very long time, for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and cookies didn't catch on in other
places quite like it did the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, LA had cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's what kind of made it
the exclusivity of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people were interested in
it, but not everybody could get real
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to come to the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to come to the city for the real
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first thing I smoked that
tasted bready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that bready character that it's
also in like wedding cake and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those contemporary strains kind of
come back to some kind of cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doughiness of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of that stuff is out there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies is in a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like this tastes like,
I guess, a kind of cherry guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong, but this is something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's smoking like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smoking clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got the ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the turps on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my top three all-favorite stains
probably cherry guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a phenomenal strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy has some gas to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag of pill color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got any big projects coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we got a bunch of big breeding
projects coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got a lot of travel coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I feel like the cannabis scene is
emerging super fast right in Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fuck with Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be back out in Houston.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, it's a bunch of travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of new seed projects in
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a lot of new things coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Houston.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother lives in Houston.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents live in Texas as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to these cities on some cannabis
related stuff and I'm not really as
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with the city as I would prefer
to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I got to Houston and I was like,
and I didn't realize it was a really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It exceeded my expectations as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never been out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was going to be a little
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, it's like real modern big city.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crawfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of Houston, I think of good
crawfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have vegan crawfish too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like something I'd like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Houston was C.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Houston was known for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have really good food there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had amazing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of living is a lot less than
California for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing the cost of living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's amazing what you can get out
there relatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how much stuff costs out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now with the THCA, it's like they
have THCA all over Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they tax that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DCC and the taxes that we have to deal
with in California is way different than
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're dealing with in Texas where
they have it in a CBD shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taxes has had the largest impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about the, might as well
call it the failure of the recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: market where it hasn't been a whole lot of
winners in the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that is just due to taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard for a consumer to pay $80
for an eighth that Bobby down the street
[SPEAKER_02]: has for $40.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from the taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's overly taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not taxed similar to other things
that would be similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not taxed like alcohol would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taxed at such a high rate that it's
made it almost impossible for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational companies to succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost like that was the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting because the price
has gone down of the flour and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: price of everything else has gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's not as much profit and it's
a big struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big struggle for a lot of
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big struggle for a lot of
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the industry as a whole has
had a difficult past, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 36 months, 36 months post COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like there's a lot of nuances
as to why that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, a lot of people made a lot of
money during COVID and invested that in
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure, which made a made a larger
supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the influx in supply is going to
always defect the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people are regretting
their investments in infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021, everybody was going bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was going bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, I got 200 lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to build out to 900.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of us thought it was
never going to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was so good during COVID
for so many people, especially in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, yeah, man, the price of the
price of cannabis went up 300 percent in
[SPEAKER_02]: like three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's unheard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why people thought that was
going to last.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was such a it was such a huge
jump in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affected the market so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I mean, I think that that influx
of cash affected a lot of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see the effects that it had on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those a lot of those
ventures, sadly enough, are failing at a
[SPEAKER_02]: high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now, I mean, we're talking about
going global and then we've got all these
[SPEAKER_00]: countries opening up and eventually
there's going to be commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do not just domestic,
but it'll be international and domestic
[SPEAKER_00]: and import export.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in the first quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're definitely like in the
first quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're in the first half of the
first quarter as far as how the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to develop in the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just scratching the surface and all the
infrastructures that have to be built out
[SPEAKER_02]: in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's definitely going to be a lot
of opportunities in cannabis in the in the
[SPEAKER_02]: upcoming future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to the new genetics,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people are there's a lot of
people breeding right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more people growing than ever
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that and that's global.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's a breeder globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't touch no pollen,
you're not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the rules are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the rules are,
but that's what I saw ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's that's supposed to be the
deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a lot of people coming up
with new strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, you're not a breeder,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you come up with a new strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a name game is real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the re rock game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's 75 different lemon cherry
gelatos with different names, at least
[SPEAKER_02]: rich off re rock grunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock grunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot of every week there's
a new strain, but no breeder attached.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know how you got that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of these brands aren't
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like just marketing, just
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny because lemon cherry gelato
is really still, I would say, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: popular thing on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's there's a lot of other
popular things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like by far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lemon cherry gelato is just dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the highest demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the highest demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like what it actually is,
is up for debate, is really up for debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's probably the largest in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as far as as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a whole solid LCG, that's what the
wholesale people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It checks the boxes for most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It checks the boxes for most people,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good, smell good, tastes good,
gets you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's enough for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Skittles doesn't have a big
ceiling, but as far as the effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't get you that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get you high like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a daytime smoke, more sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a it's approachable to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's one thing with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody can ever and everybody can
appreciate that flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to get on a joint number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that one where you fire up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like it so much, you're not sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke it to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this one's got a nice ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some drip to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny is really good flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like from the time you light it up,
it changes and the flavor intensifies as
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really good down into the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that is if the last 40 percent
of your joint is enjoyable, that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: good rare flour.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you're 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 30 percent of the joint left in
this joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's top tier flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say on average stuff,
the first hit might taste good and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some stuff that looks so good,
you got to smoke it and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it smells so good and the smell
doesn't transfer into the taste of the
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple punch is one that I am not a huge
fan of straight purple punch, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it breathes well into stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just has kind of bland turps like
you might get a little flavor when you
[SPEAKER_00]: light it up and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the flavor that it does have,
though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That had a nice sweet candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a predecessor to the candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extract is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the extract on that's really good,
but I'm not a huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not most people's thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't have the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has the bag of pill though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a lot of growers have
success growing it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbidden fruit was another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like forbidden fruit had its 15
minutes of fame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so I feel like it was unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: The appeal went bad fast overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were like, I don't want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they decided that they didn't
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first bag of forbidden
fruit I smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, eh, not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny because Tangy really had
its day for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy was, you know, it was winning all
the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the most awarded
strains in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't see Tangy anymore,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't see Tangy anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You see Tangy that's grown to get washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a lot of Tangy rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some Tangy strains that are grown
just to get washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like orange turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I mean, I like every kind of turp
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a citrus turp guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that'd be like my least favorite
probably is like some citrus turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I won't go by it or go out of my
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of the, yeah, some of the high
shit is like some orangey citrusy turps
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've seen lately that people are
like, hey, this is the high shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like the orange citrus turps,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that orange server.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange server is unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, orange wouldn't be my,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that one is not super popular
in the market as far as for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen a blacked out strain that
tastes citrusly like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that orange server was like full
color, dark, dark as fuck, orangey,
[SPEAKER_02]: zirby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like sun kissed oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you have to really like that
orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like how Jack is kind of
disliked.
Orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've heard of orange
Julius.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a chain of like this orange
drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the orange server tastes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen a citrusy, orangey like
perped out super dark strain like that
[SPEAKER_02]: one, but same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I voted against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely some people that
appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spoke Super Booth?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds familiar, but I don't believe I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about Dante's Inferno?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not that one either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some more smaller batch grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mile High Dave has that Dante's Inferno.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard of that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, I haven't smoked any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't touched a lot of the smaller
batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, but I haven't been dug into a lot
of the smaller batch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about Zope?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if LCG is number one,
Zope might be the two or the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be the two or the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be one of those strains that
people still have interest in,
[SPEAKER_02]: might still have like similar value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real Zope is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real Zope is a really amazing
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: SF Kana and Planta, both of my cultivation
partners have grown it and they both came
[SPEAKER_02]: with some really amazing representations
of Zope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely, Zope is definitely a
pretty dope strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you gonna go with SF Kana on that
one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guess what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, let me see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was gonna say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this could glean either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's burning clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I could tell you which ones it's
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's Guava Gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Guava Gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have GG4 on the bag, so everyone's
like Gorilla Glue number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's Guava Gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the five better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really, I think that I think
that we found some really dope Guava Gas
[SPEAKER_02]: Finos.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's gonna be a hit though,
but I think the potency on the shit is
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potency on the shit is really crazy,
but I don't know that it's gonna be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that it's gonna be a wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
It's gonna be a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did for NorCal Nemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very unique brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very unique brand that's been
around for 18 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's been around 18 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been able to make a lot of shit
jump that most people can't make jump.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the number they're getting for their
units is astronomical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect to them, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much respect to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're definitely, I feel like there's so
many, yeah, there's so many segments of
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have their segment of the market
that's willing to pay an astronomical
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of money for their product,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of people hate on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people love them, but I'm not mad
at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've done an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that don't like them, they have
their own issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's levels to all this,
and there's price points for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what, you go in to buy a car,
there's price points that go on up forever
[SPEAKER_00]: and ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether it's worth it or not,
that's like, yeah, that's a matter of
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that are paying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it's worth that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They must.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're paying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know for an actual factual that
they're paying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, I got a friend that pays,
yeah, I got a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a friend that just got a QP at
an astronomical rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are paying that, okay, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was saying that, yes, he could get
X amount for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's absurd.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the market's there for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, not mad at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not mad at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had some really good
representations of their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I respect their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's most good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect what they've done as a brand as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've curated their audience and they've
been able to get the highest dollar for
[SPEAKER_02]: their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not mad at them by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we would have gone up as much with
inflation, that's what we all would be
[SPEAKER_00]: paying compared to like the 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the price of weed,
yes, it hasn't gone up with inflation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's because, I mean,
when it was illegal, it was being produced
[SPEAKER_02]: at a lower rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that it's legal, there's less risk,
so there's less reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's less risk, so there's definitely
less reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big part of why the price is
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 50 pounds are probably,
you're probably going home.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get pulled over with 50 pounds,
your mother in California, you're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: going home today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a smile and a handshake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when 50 grams, you're probably
not going home.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think 50 pounds now, they're not
even going to bring you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to cite you and release you
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to test the theory out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to test the theory out,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rumor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a way different age, so way less
risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got to be less reward,
even though it's still rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a misdemeanor now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it should be for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we had Luke Scarmazzo on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did 14 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luke Scarmazzo was the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when he went down,
he was the dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the flex king of his era.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was definitely the flex king of his
era.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that he has a great, a better
image now, but Luke Scarmazzo was the guy
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, I know of his legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like he has his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a living legend to a certain
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and he's young still.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's young still, but the story was he was
like skyballing off cannabis in a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time ago, and then he got busted by the
feds and did a lot of time behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I heard he was the flex king.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, he wrote a good book, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: His stories, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear his whole story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely read that whole book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he was like getting money the
generation before me, and I think it was a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was doing his thing,
getting a lot of bread, and then got hit
[SPEAKER_02]: by the feds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story that I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the story that I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I heard it was one of the people that
people were getting behind trying to help
[SPEAKER_02]: support to get out of prison, and I was
like, I definitely heard of Brogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's definitely a living legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the streets, he's a legend for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like not everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people know that he was in jail
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know the whole story.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know that he was a legend in
these streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was doing big shit in the
streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pushing boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pushing boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was pushing them over.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was pushing them over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a thing for sure, and it was a
different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a different era.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long do you think gelato is gonna
be, not even gelato, but that flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profile is gonna be on top?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think 10, 12 years, you think it's
gonna go sooner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, if I had the answer to that one,
I'd be rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like everybody wants to
know what's next, and I feel like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: been large marketing efforts to push
what's next, but I don't think anything's
[SPEAKER_02]: really caught the traction of the broader
market yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long that's gonna last,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, I mean, I think that as it
develops, there's so much infinite variety
[SPEAKER_02]: of flavors that there's gonna be savory,
gassy, sweet, different categories of
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors, and the market's gonna determine
what's gonna be the most popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, because back in the day,
it was very regional, what was popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: was OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had cookies in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had sour diesel in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in Florida, they had their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like because of accessibility
and because of social media, everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what's popular, and so it's all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're a lot more global world.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, yes, with the internet and
social media, we're a lot more global
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like slang and fashion used to be
more regional, but as far as how the
[SPEAKER_02]: access to information and access to
people, I feel like we're more global
[SPEAKER_02]: society.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the trends seem to be more
global.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, food slowly become that,
extremely global.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a global society.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk to people nationwide so easily
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much access to information now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much, too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much sometimes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I feel like there's a lot of
information and there's just as much
[SPEAKER_02]: misinformation, so it just depends who you
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could go back in time to your
younger self that had just been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for one or two years,
what would be your biggest piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: advice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust your hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust your hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel like that's a thing.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I ever looked at cannabis as
a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe if I had thought it was a career
and I had invested more time in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have could have got further.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more or less, I'm happy with how
things worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's great that you're driven by
passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the biggest blessings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and really, to start off smoking,
it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends that start off
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like an avid smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everything about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what made me fall in love with
it was the smoking, not just the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting to see because there's a
lot of growers that are really passionate
[SPEAKER_02]: about the growing aspect, not so much the
smoking aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I'm definitely the smoking
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting to see that like
people value in my palate because it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't like a skill that I set out to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're blessed by being in the right
circles of people to have exposure to the
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get the good stuff,
you can never go back, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's real tough to go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can go back financially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be the circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you smoked and enjoyed really
good flowers, it's hard to go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't smoke no meds.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard even going on vacation when you
have such good flower unless you have
[SPEAKER_00]: flower with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about global.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's places like Spain where you can
really get good flower, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, yeah, that that that
dictates some of my travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go anywhere where we can't
smoke good because how good could it be if
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the future, that would be really
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you had a brand and you could have
to ensure the same quality globally,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Papa A the plant to open in
California and get the same quality in
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain, get the same quality in the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be that'd be pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Freshness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: How fast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: How fast?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like a lot of times we take
two steps forward and one step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we're still going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the progress is slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the progress is slow, but we're heading
in the right direction, making huge
[SPEAKER_02]: strides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think any of us envisioned
legalization being like this when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think this.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd invest more time into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was going to it was going to
develop the way it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Sam, I'm happy how it worked
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just in general with technology
and the emerging technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got the virtual reality
glasses that just came as wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the evolution of cannabis
is is is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's evolved just as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the culture of cannabis
enthusiasts has evolved, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like a lot of culture and
events that are starting to develop like
[SPEAKER_02]: super fast that we'll see like on a global
scale in our lifetime probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to try that one last joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to go back to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mystery joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mystery joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that you don't think is SF10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it smokes well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I was going to say,
that like I feel like a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: brands are known for especially like
cultivation brands that are known for
[SPEAKER_02]: certain strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they all grow a bunch of
different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say, you know,
I know you're friends with the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get some of the ones that not
everybody gets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it tastes like something we could
have grown, but definitely something that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not known for be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys stay away from Lumberth.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are well grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are very well rolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who rolled these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional joint roller at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's our joint guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I roll joints too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets the band on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets it down perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I write, I roll good joints
myself, but I enjoy, I enjoy these a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the collaboration with
SFCannon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got pre-rolls coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been R&Ding them for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to R&D them for longer,
but this is the pre-roll that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be releasing in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a nice size.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good size joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that three gram to three and a half
grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, I feel like you get the best
flavor out of them, especially when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good and you can smoke it down like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that as a share size.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm smoking it by myself, I would
probably want it a little bit smaller,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for a share size, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like with the SFCannon weed,
for example, you can put it back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tube and you can pull it out of the tube
and it still tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that four or five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really, and then same thing with
pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big on giving people joints for pheno
hunting rather than giving them the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all kind of on the same,
even playing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I wish people did that for me and
just hand me pre-roll joints of all the,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the phenos and be like, Hey,
just smoke these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, nah, I want to see the flower
too though, but I want to like both
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, someone like you, I would share the
flower with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd share the flower with you and then I
want to know the feedback on the joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everybody, for the most part,
I know what the good flower looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it has bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the really the taste and the effect
that I want to know feedback from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in like, how did it taste in the
joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoked it halfway, was the flavor
gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was the flavor even better down when you
fired the road chip the next day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the weed or the flavor changes as
you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't stay consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, this is the one that gets
put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that this was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not your cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This didn't really taste right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this one might've been spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not even THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, which one do I really like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit more about your MMA
career.
[SPEAKER_02]: MMA is a tough way to make a living.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: On my MMA career, I felt like I was very
blessed to be around some of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the sport.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was blessed to be around some of the
best people in the sport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that I was blessed to see like
how people at a high level perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was, I was around some of the,
some of the best fighters in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting to see how like the
best people perform and handle things at a
[SPEAKER_02]: high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so my fighting career was dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it was, it was really dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that I enjoyed as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I was passionate about that I was
able to make some money doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's a, I really fighter pay
is the most fucked up shit in like sports.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, like the amount of revenue
that the largest MMA promotions are paying
[SPEAKER_02]: their fighters is like very small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like most professional sports,
I think the revenue sharing is like closer
[SPEAKER_02]: to 50% to where like the league makes 50%,
the players make 50% somewhere in that
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that like professional
fighting, it's like the largest company
[SPEAKER_02]: gets 85% of the profits and they pay out
their people 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that there's a lot of,
that the fighter pay is really fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we're speaking out, the fighter
pay is fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the fighter, if the fighter pay was
better, I might've fought more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't like, and I feel like the
fame and clout is high, but the pay is
[SPEAKER_02]: low.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I feel like, yeah, the opening pay
for some of these larger promotions isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like there is some people
making a really good living, but it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: very small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people that are fighting are
definitely in it for the love of the fight
[SPEAKER_02]: game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for the bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the, I think only like a
real, real sliver of the people are making
[SPEAKER_02]: a good living doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of people crushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a handful of people getting their
bag, but not that many.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not that many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Nate Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's showing everyone how it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been showing everybody how it's done
for a long time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as fighting goes, I was
definitely blessed to be around some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best fight camps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a part of your favorite team,
Alpha male.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were MMA team of the, of the world
three years in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did, I trained a lot with Diaz
brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trained a lot with Nate Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did get to train with some of the
best people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, I mean, I enjoyed the
lifestyle for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could have made better money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably still be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's their cardio?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was training with Nate,
I feel like obviously their cardio is
[SPEAKER_02]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like my cardio was on a high level
and we were smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, we were smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like cardio was on a,
on a, on a very high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my last fight for Bellator,
the dude I filed was supposed to have like
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible cardio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like he was more tired than I was and I
was smoking a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much of a negative effect smoking has
on, has on athletic performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not much with the Diaz
brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, those dudes can go forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those dudes can go forever for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then Nick's banned for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it was really unfortunate in
that he was definitely competed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong era because the bulk of his career,
he was suspended for smoking, but that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: dude who's definitely going to do what he
wants to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: An injustice to sport that we didn't get
to see that dude perform more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he's a, that's a tragedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a special athlete.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a special Nick Diaz.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a special athlete.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that he's a, he's a unique and
special martial artists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we didn't get to see him
in his prime because of he was a sideline
[SPEAKER_02]: because of, of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who's your favorite MMA fighter of all
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you say that because Nick
Diaz might be my favorite MMA fighter of
[SPEAKER_02]: all time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got good relationships with some really
amazing fighters like Gilbert Melendez,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the local ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy because as far as like
skillset that I respect of how they do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's probably my favorite fighter of all
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Nick Diaz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a tough one, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he'll do it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably, that's probably,
I mean, he might be the go to my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a really, really talented mixed
martial artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CJ used to train with him as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in CJ's corner back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Northern California,
I feel like, yeah, it's a tight knit fight
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is the same way and fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of fighting people who have
transitioned into cannabis and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of fighting people who make a living
on the side in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's, cannabis is like pretty
prevalent in fight culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the Jiu Jitsu guys smoke a lot of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Jiu Jitsu guys smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grow the shit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so people are trying to get a hold
of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they go to find you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm pretty accessible,
but I'm, you know, you can find me online
[SPEAKER_02]: at Freddie Big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm, yeah, pretty readily
accessible online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me about your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I brought some, some food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Noire so plant cannabis companies,
the Los Angeles based cultivation company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that my cultivation partner does
an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: New flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've, we, we've put some new flavors
into rotation and we're running some
[SPEAKER_02]: classics too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this Cleopatra right here is a candy
gas, 11 coffins is also a candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are both bred by Dookavyr背 and I
think there's some really different,
[SPEAKER_02]: unique terms we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bhinessa as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a really dope representation of a
really popular classic strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my cultivation partner does a
really amazing job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're available in all the
best stores in Southern California at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment, Backpack Boys, Go Global,
Atrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so that's what I brought out
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we've had a, we just did
our first rec drop less than a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're making a press into the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that my cultivation partner does
an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the quality and flavors
are pretty exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to having you on the show
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you having me.
Click, click, click.
