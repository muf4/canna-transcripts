[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm James Loud and welcome to another
episode of the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, our special guest is Dave from
Gastown.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Dave?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just taking it all in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Gastown is up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are based out in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met in Barcelona at Spannibus two years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also shared a booth with
Greenhouse Seed Company and then also did
[SPEAKER_02]: it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This recent Spannibus and it was an
amazing adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you smoke good weed,
I smoke good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both like good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're forgetting one other time that we
met is at our mutual friend's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we're going to ask or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met in Amsterdam at the apartments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were staying there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stay there pretty religiously.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was actually at another friend's
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our wizard friend who we have shared some
experiences with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were staying at the apartments though,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was staying at the apartments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was staying at the apartments and we
went to dinner with Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, okay, usually I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we even crossed paths like at
his place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when it was, I don't know,
something about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bufo adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you've had a mutual experience
like that, that is very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: life changing and monumental.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big connection for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soma is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a one in a trillion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like not one in a million,
not one in a billion, one in a trillion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nobody I've ever met quite like
him and I never will meet another person
[SPEAKER_02]: quite like Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's extremely special and I have a lot of
love for Soma and you know, spiritual
[SPEAKER_02]: guidance and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's just an all round good
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he, loves his family and friends
and I just got a lot of love for Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always done me right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like his intentions are just
always so pure and genuine and just the
[SPEAKER_01]: way he talks to people, there's no,
it's just pure and genuine and what more
[SPEAKER_01]: do you want out of any relationship?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a freaking character.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually, he's a character,
you know, and I've tripped on things and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually seen Soma and even though he
wasn't there, I've seen him and had
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences with him outside of this
existence, which is wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can't say that with a lot of,
about a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a handful of them and yeah,
spiritual guide or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soma is always there looking over us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spiritual experience I did have with
him was extremely life changing and helped
[SPEAKER_01]: me just be extra sure of my path and part
of the reason I'm sitting here right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so you're a lover of Amsterdam,
Barcelona, you're a world traveler.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen you in Thailand and on
Instagram, at least I've never been to
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I plan on going this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to check out some genetics and
stuff like that, that are growing over
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so our mutual friend Ariane was a big
motivational factor for me when I went
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also part of the reason I was in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My father passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a license in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of there trying to put
together the pieces after he suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: passed away at his facility got crushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was part of also the spiritual
guidance through Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of got into a dead end where I
didn't know where to go with the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ariane gave me the suggestion to go to
Thailand and to go check it out and that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's lots of opportunity there and this
and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kind of gave me a push to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went like a month later and I had
an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to check out their facility and got
to get super motivated by what him and
[SPEAKER_01]: Dustin are doing, watching their team just
execute on just a high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The partners who they partnered with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the whole thing is just like a dream
come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just see the spark in Ariane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've known him for, I want to say,
six to eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never in my whole time knowing
him seen any sort of spark in him like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen with this whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he really it's a really cool
passion project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got him so motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see him when he does his
presentations and everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fan of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it because when I first met him,
he was excited and he did some fun stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but then Franco passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the passing of Franco,
I think there was a lot of sadness,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just with Ariane, but within the
industry, but especially Ariane losing his
[SPEAKER_02]: best friend and somebody who was his like
the yin and yang balance to him and
[SPEAKER_02]: finding where you belong in the world
after something like that happens,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, takes some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I mean, it's pretty amazing with
Thailand, you know, from going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo and all the stuff they've done in
their career, but now reinventing
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves in Thailand on another level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing
watching from, from this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the cheap seats, watching them on
Instagram and seeing this stuff they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the new strain hunters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they're, they're so passionate
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dust is just, he's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's super passionate as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like they're just super
passionate about what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, and just the level that they do
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they showed that kind of in the Congo
with the, the, the, how many, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the amount of count of the phenol
hunts they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this industry of genetics,
as we both know, your credibility comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from big phenol hunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get any credibility
doing a three seat phenol hunt and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: a winner or bag seat or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got a hundred, you know,
20 plus is kind of like 30 plus is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and he's out here doing 10,000,
3000 minimum per, per strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think that's a little
extreme person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're really finding outliers and
stuff like that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I prefer smaller phenol hunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three is not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, three doesn't tell you anything
about your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, it really might tell you if it's worth
looking through more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me, I mean, I think like
that 20 to 50 range is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, some, some genetics,
it's worth going through a hundred and
[SPEAKER_02]: some, you know, you're going to find kind
of what you're looking for in a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, when you have the space
and you have the money, that is the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it is doing larger hunts and you can do
several genetics when you're doing them
[SPEAKER_02]: that size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think there's,
there's gold in those, uh, those hunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the team is extra important to the
team that they have established down there
[SPEAKER_01]: is really next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to keep all those still
alive while they grow through their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycle is another huge undertaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think if not the biggest
undertaking in the whole process,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going to do that big of a phenol
hunt, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just tip my hat to them and their
whole team for even attempting the process
[SPEAKER_01]: and then now executing on such high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really cool to see and just
to even witness the whole situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool to watch the last couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when, when you see your friends
success, it's always amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at the, the level they can do it
on is just, it's pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and when it's your friends being
successful, it's even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love watching my friends
succeed in my friends kick ass and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, especially taking stuff to a new
level and it requires commitment and
[SPEAKER_02]: dedication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we talk about being a
business owners, getting kicked in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nuts every day and waking up and smiling
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really, you know,
I think we were meant to do something on
[SPEAKER_02]: this plane of existence on, on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like working with cannabis is
where I belong, where you belong,
[SPEAKER_02]: where Arian and greenhouse belong and dust
and dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and Mr. X, we got Oscar, his
photography and all the guys over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have been holding back saying
this whole time, the number one word is
[SPEAKER_01]: team and what they have created,
what Arian has created as a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he really knows how to pump everybody
up and make them feel special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another huge thing I learned
from Soma and the whole experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: the UFO is like, all you have on this
world is the opportunity to make people
[SPEAKER_01]: feel special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how you make people feel is all that
matters, you know, and Arian's good at
[SPEAKER_01]: making people feel special and his team
feels special working for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why he gets what he gets out of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool to just watch and be a
part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels super special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even being there at the time I have,
it's been really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny cause so being in this
industry, you're able to observe different
[SPEAKER_02]: leadership styles and, and in different
companies and different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that I've, I've been exposed to
and then have mentored me like Arian and a
[SPEAKER_02]: handful of other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I feel like have told me the truth,
even when I didn't want to hear it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then there's the,
the ego and losing the ego is so
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that also happens when you
get a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second you start getting in your like
late thirties, early forties, you really
[SPEAKER_02]: start losing your ego and quitting quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You quit carrying what other people think
as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you become a good storyteller
along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause to become a good storyteller,
some people are great from the get,
[SPEAKER_02]: but after you've been through enough
experience, then you can really start
[SPEAKER_02]: telling your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an important part of
the cannabis history of the oral history
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis, like the show and stuff that
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the cannabis history is just
so important to the world that we live in
[SPEAKER_02]: and to the next generation and the
generation after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on and so forth down the line,
because we've got all these
[SPEAKER_02]: revolutionaries and people changing the
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great being able to tell stories
about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Arianne and Soma are a couple of great
examples of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their generation, what they've lived
through from the high times cups to the
[SPEAKER_01]: current cups now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just messaged Arianne the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yo, did you realize that you
guys won a Billy's award?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, what's a Billy's award?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, dude, this big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, it was like third place,
second place, second place sativa for
[SPEAKER_02]: super silver haze, super lemon haze,
super lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For super lemon haze, second place,
still winning awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many cups of super lemon haze won over
the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's a cross or the extra things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you it's one of the top all time
winning strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super lemon haze, super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he has a gazillion cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not winning them all now, but like,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but back in the day it was the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't many haze cups now either
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't see haze winning cups,
but I do see haze making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super silver making a comeback too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, super lemon haze and all
these different hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, PIF is really popular now here or
becoming more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you much experience with like Congo
or Malawi gold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like the Durban, the Congo and the
Malawi are all very sacred to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked some red Congo from gold leaf on
one of the future cannabis projects
[SPEAKER_02]: episodes with Marlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm never doing that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got too high on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a handful of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the red Congo and the Malawi and the
Durban all have different effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might say they taste similar,
but to me they don't, but they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're kind of, you know,
they're land racy, I guess airy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like the flavor on them is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effect is extremely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that red Congo makes me giggle and
laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I just have amazing time on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like Marlin and I, we do these things
where we get too fucked up, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: weed or mushrooms or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I looked at him,
he, he would laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time he looked back at me,
I would laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I tried not to laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can't hold it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fucking laughing bursting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the Durban just kicks your ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the Durban is super strong and
more introspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like of a OG buzz, like a gas
buzz, or is it still in that Sativa realm
[SPEAKER_01]: as the other two?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say there's more sedative
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is super strong Durban for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same thing, Malawi is really strong
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but Malawi is like borderline
hallucinogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Durban can be too in extremes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you make bang with it,
where, you know, like the, the milk where
[SPEAKER_02]: you infuse it into the milk, like fat or
whatever, then ingest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like MCT oil type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do MCT oil, but bang is actually
like a milk that's been infused with it
[SPEAKER_02]: and you drink it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's like a Indian tradition and
it's so, it's super strong and potent and
[SPEAKER_02]: it hits you pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like those psychedelic ones,
they really, you really feel the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a, and I thought when I was first
making my brand, like 2016, Congo was a
[SPEAKER_01]: popular thing going on around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finally had, that was also when
BHOs first came around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had some really nice extract
of Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it was such a low yielder and
such a long flowering plant, there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: much of the extract around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like really rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had some, I remember how excited
I was and what I did is I started my day
[SPEAKER_01]: with it for a few days in a row,
but I couldn't get anything done in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so scatterbrained.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, like my regular routine,
I could not get anything done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to sit there and realize what
the difference was that I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this extract and I just
couldn't do a dab of Congo in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do it as my morning coffee
with Sativa, but it ended up ruining my
[SPEAKER_01]: whole morning where I couldn't even do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to wait till the buzz wore off to
even like, I could have like drawn or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe done a sport or done something
where, but as soon as I had to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, I could not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could not apply myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't focus on anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, I mean, Durban,
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I can apply myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't say that Durban is like OG
necessarily, but it doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more you smoke, the higher you get,
there is no ceiling to how high you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these modern genetics that people
are creating, they have ceilings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you can smoke them and you
only get so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you smoke them throughout the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never get higher than right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like Durban and Malau,
Koi and Congo and Colombian, you smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: some real fucking Colombian dudes,
like the real Colombian genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff does not have a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just keep getting higher and higher
the more you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, there's no limit to how
high you can get from that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you lining up now?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Brandon, you guys or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridgeline Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is Ridgeline Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be on the podcast in two
episodes from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're doing big things up in
Humboldt and this is the Lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, well, I'll let you taste it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want my honest opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want my honest opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want your honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great for a commercial
pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's greenhouse grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a unique, well, it's very runcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little like in the, almost like a
sour taste in my palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know if that's like the newts or
what, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's living soil, organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't love the turps, but the buzz I'm
liking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm liking the buzz that I'm getting from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting some actual like heady buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I wouldn't like, I'm not like
enjoying the turps personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, like, so let's talk about turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're super picky, but you smoke a lot
of extract too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're all about turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've been flower guy since I was 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked a bunch of joints in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've evolved into the extract scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there was a period in the early 2000s
before hash or before bubble hash was like
[SPEAKER_01]: really super popular where we were washing
in Vancouver and making ice hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but we didn't know what the hell we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a lot of knowledge on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everybody was kind of learning
as they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What hash church was, was people sharing
their experiences learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was able to elevate it
exponentially.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was huge community.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most important communities for
the hash movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tip my hat to them for that big
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark killing it to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the profiles that I do like are
like, I love gelatos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, like, I really liked that like
clean taste so that I'm not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by like that almost like
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want it floral?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want a gassy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want a little bit floral,
a little bit gassy?
I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like personally, like my favorite
profiles, I like to smoke different stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like to start in the morning with a
nice Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll move into like something
that's a little bit more fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about the effects of Z?
[SPEAKER_01]: You like, I feel like it's a good,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's uppity, but not too uppity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't get me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still get high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like it's, I feel like it's
one of those ones with the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can still get high, but it
doesn't take you over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a clean high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep smoking it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the way down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and yeah, you can get sick as you get
sick of anything for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like smoking a different joint,
every joint I smoke throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I never really got sick of
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cat piss and the sour diesel are the
two things that we go back that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think I ever get sick of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of that would have to do
whoever grew that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I bet you, if you got that same
group who always grew that fire batch is
[SPEAKER_01]: some other strains too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you maybe have some connection to
that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like most strains,
unless you really have like a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: adverse effect to it are awesome if grown
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I also like having a lot
of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like they all send you in a
different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of apply for a different
function throughout the day, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going out for lunch, whether it's playing
a sport, whether it's watching a movie,
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a video game, I like smoking
different stuff for everything or the same
[SPEAKER_01]: few things for the same few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always trying new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I like, I like the new experience of
being able to find something that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: never seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'm always waiting for that lottery
ticket, you know, anywhere you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That new, have you tried the new toad
venom?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not tried weed toad venom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's why I like it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it's a new one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the group, but it's like the hot
new thing in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was there, everybody's on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hash from it's super far too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Z blend or a Z cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not diet Skittles by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not diet Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it probably is diet on the Z end of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's obviously diluted, but like,
no, it's not like whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't, I'm okay with stuff where
it's diluted, but it's complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like a lighter Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as terpy, which is a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the Skittles crosses,
the Skittles S1s, a lot of those end up
[SPEAKER_02]: being not as terpy as Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, why would you have
something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to grow something
that's not as good as the, maybe it has a
[SPEAKER_02]: little better structure or whatever,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour diesels like this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find sour diesel crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the original sour, the real sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're never on that level as the
original sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's only a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my partner and I back in the day
did some sour back crosses and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were doing, I think we were doing
really good work, but JJ from Top Dog is
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aficionado has sour crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Karma's got some sour crosses,
like just out the gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those three guys are all doing some good
sour work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of sour, like sour is tough to
work with as a cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour structure, the recessive traits
coming through in whatever you're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what are you shooting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's maybe a lot of what's
happening is maybe they're not searching
[SPEAKER_01]: for the real original sour OG traits or I
don't know, but I haven't found many.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably got to go through a lot more
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that that was the thing with
us back in the day was being able to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lot and you know, it's like then
selecting and finding ones that are really
[SPEAKER_02]: sour where it does justice to the sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that like there's fire crosses for
sure, but I'm just saying it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: sour, you know, like that sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of the Z crosses are
doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you see the Z name on the
jar, you see the sour name on the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a certain expectation attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's probably what's not being
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the longest time, OG was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have like some OG cross that was
just not quite great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no OG seeds for the longest
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't get real OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get like OG widow, OG critical from
the guys in Europe or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like nothing like the OG that
we liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the variant of like
region to region of the OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lemon one that I find out
there's more gassy ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's definitely more piney and
there's more citrusy ones and more earthy
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have ones that lean directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of those directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like all three of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like pine though.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the original one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, the original one was piney and SFV
had like pine and it was lemon and pine
[SPEAKER_02]: and earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what I going on a second
information when I ask questions to people
[SPEAKER_01]: who I really look up to and respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I've got from most
of the people is that the original OG was
[SPEAKER_01]: a piney, gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pine cones, chunky pine cones,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow pine cones, like not that great in
node spacing, but like amazing buds that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking you smoke those down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gassy all the way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian from Vital and John Mikey won.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got some good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's some other guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't think of the brand right now,
but they're in Salinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When US or in the world is the best OG
from and still grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, that's a multi answer
question, but like the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we go down into LA, I feel like if
you wanted the best OG, like LA was where
[SPEAKER_02]: you go to get OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then if you wanted to go get cookies,
like this is like 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you want cookies, you came up to
the Bay, cookies, sherbert, gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that stuff got pumped out of the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that it was blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: When blue dream was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was coming out of the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the original hype stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk about New York and New York had
the sour, but it came from California to
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's an interesting thing that
happened in the late nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got these Beaster strings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Canadian Beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like before your time,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was my heyday bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the Beasters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to bring it up for the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got the Beasters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they would come down to the Bay and
they were like a football.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, a pound was this big and a pound
should be this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you maybe got the later Beasters then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this stuff was pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevermind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see them at that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen them before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, this was like 97 to 2004,
2005, probably maybe a little before that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there was this period where the
Beasters, the BC bud took over.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was interesting as far as
like that there were bigger numbers of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could get a hundred of this or
whatever, but a lot of stuff, they ran oh
[SPEAKER_02]: three to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was like a hay smell to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff looked really good,
but it was also compressed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's the orange crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we had really good orange crush
and some others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a bunch of other genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the names of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause I remember the names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually jog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jamaican was like the main one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Jamaican big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just these big, huge donkey,
like lime green and their bud light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were 12 inch buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't smoke worth a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were just, they were horrible
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing bag of peel through the roof and
they smelled kind of like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they didn't really have much smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the buyers were approving the
packs without actually opening the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd bring like a 20 pack and they'd
be in the sleeves, back sleeves and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would just look and they'd see the big
long donks and the lime green,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as they were like the right trim
and they were like the right look,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just would approve them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of times you'd have to go up
to Seattle or wherever they were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd have to go into a garage and of
somebody's house typically, and you pull
[SPEAKER_02]: in and there's a bunch of packs and you're
actually going through some of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: opening them up to find the right ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you got to go on look to find the
rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going for 200, you don't have
time to open every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you do is you would basically look
for specific ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd open it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd remember what it looks like and you
try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, hopefully you picked all the ones
that look like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're good, you hit it a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're bad, you hit it a lot less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you were going for the a hundred
percent cause there could be mixed ones in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that just had no smell to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them didn't even look at,
you know, but like it, cause it was all
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting talking to someone on either
end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely was only a part of like,
like the rounding it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what they did beyond that,
but I definitely was a juicy fruit came
[SPEAKER_02]: down from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jamaican juicy fruit is the same thing,
just renamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the same strain, the same
interesting from what I, from what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: taught as a, as a young lad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was Louie, which is LUI
legends of ultimate Indica sugar shack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tasted like smell like carrots,
kind of a little bit red hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the strains were just like the
hash brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hash plant back in the day was a
little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lizard was another,
if you know that the chair, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: God bud was another really popular,
but I remember Chisca berries,
[SPEAKER_02]: another one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a Hawaiian, the Hawaiian
big buds and a couple others blueberry and
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple others were around too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's a few different blueberries
on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like someone's grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever tried someone's grapefruit,
the New York city diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that one's pretty special too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It yields like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge plant and it's super great
fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is grapefruit turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the most grapefruit of anything I've
tried over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like a lot of the grapefruit packs
we were getting were from the Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a really good chance that they
just got seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was so great fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had this and it was like orange
hair, like super orange hairs,
[SPEAKER_01]: little golf balls to like the size of an
orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the buds would stack really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get big, I mean, even indoor,
you got chunky, big colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a green, these guys used to
just, yeah, totally small plants and flip
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they used to get a room and like the,
the gorilla growing, they would do in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada was like, you have your room and
whatever the dimensions were, that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be the, your bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would just make one big bed,
the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would just put the seeds or cuts
all in the room and they would just grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were just wrecking houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why growing gave such a bad
name in BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause these guys were literally like
ruining houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it was all grown in houses back in
the day, just like it was here in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess there was maybe a handful
of people that figured out how to get
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, but most people was like,
yeah, bunkers, warehouses, early days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, grown in houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you start getting, or when did
you get into cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for when I was a kid, like not even
16, I was doing seeds in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in the Highlands, which was kind
of a rural area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never successfully flowered anything
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always died before I could,
but I was like a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was already playing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I was 18, 19, I started
working at the shipyard and my dad was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a legendary biker in the
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the guys at the shipyard knew who I
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one guy that I guess looked up to
my dad and stuff was like, took me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, yo, come, I'll show you how
to grow up my place, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got him some genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was actually the first place I
washed at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yo, I want to make hash
out of your smalls in your, in your trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first hash I ever made
was his.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was working at the shipyard and I
would just go by there and is this water
[SPEAKER_01]: before people started selling trim or
after you have before this is 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember those years too,
because people did not sell trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, you could get it for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it'd be fan leaves mixed in
until 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in a lot of it, like my friends
trimmed wet, not all of them, but for the
[SPEAKER_02]: most part we trimmed wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, I need to buy a chest
freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when we used to make bubble
hash and I'd get the free, it'd be mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: in with the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was still really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fresh frozen, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we froze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We whipped it in a frigging paint mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that when I decided I was going
commercial with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like when we started out, it was a
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Free bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start with a wooden spoon and ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were kind of heading the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then you use a red solo cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my buddy, Luke taught me this
way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use the red solo cup to scoop the ice
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then any plant material ice,
you scoop it out and then until you keep
[SPEAKER_02]: scooping it down and then you pour the
very end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hash gets poured over to a
silkscreen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to dry it on the silkscreen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 97, 98 maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pre-bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got bubble bags shortly after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get the idea from Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from New Zealand?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he got it from some hippies up in,
in Sonoma, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a spot in Occidental or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but they, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so pretty fucking amazing though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking badass hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super amazing bubble hash that
really bubbled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you weren't agitating it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're, you're being super gentle and
you're doing the paddle tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas we were like grabbing paint mixer,
drywall mud mixers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went straight to the industrial
cause I already knew I had multiple people
[SPEAKER_01]: with huge garbage bags full of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like it was going bad in the garbage
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we needed to do it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even, we didn't even think about
freezing it at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just left it in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the garbage bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until later.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, why don't we freeze this
stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it works okay with dry plan material,
but the frozen is where it's at for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, so we were doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting it free and I had a big
oak tree in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had lines that went over the oak
tree so I could do three bubble bags at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time with pulleys on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we did the pulley system where you
could tie it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he would pull it up and it would drain
where you didn't have to break your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we were doing the big 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tech you can do where you don't
have to break your back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was, we didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we bought, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we were so far ahead of our time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways we had bought a washing
machine thinking, dude, wouldn't it be
[SPEAKER_02]: great to be able to use a washing machine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's just like kind of the,
it became the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was 20 years before it became the
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ahead of your time with the paddle
and you're ahead of your time with the
[SPEAKER_01]: washing machine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy who, yeah, we tried, we actually
tried using a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought it over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fucking didn't figure out how to make
it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had we done that maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mesh bag wasn't on the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have been revolutionaries had we
done that properly and you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey man, you were, you were like this
close.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, but it's, it's all about the
passion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you, and you made some fire hash and
you were motivated forever to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff is super fun and exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you feel like you're creating
something new or inventing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some excitement that I get from an
explorer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're uncharted territories,
Christopher Columbus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's not the best example,
but like an inventor, like, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albert Einstein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Einstein's a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein,
you know, like weed light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then BHO we started doing BHO early
2000s before they had Dabrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were blasting BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the first BHO blast you ever did?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a table and we had slots in the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the first was just, uh,
tubes, PVC tubes with, with ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my buddy came over the same guy
who actually taught me how to make bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash came over and was like, dude,
we're going to, we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's open blasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did in, uh, four tubes in each
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, so after this years after,
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, there, I guess people
started doing it probably in 98 K from
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome technologies, wrote a paper on it
in 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started doing our 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know him back then, but we had a
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had four PVC tubes in it and each PVC
tube would get two cans of butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would take, it had three holes on
one side, one hole on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have a fucking coffee filter that was
cut that it would go through and we would
[SPEAKER_02]: pack it down with plant material,
buds, whatever we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but you would fucking pump it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have two at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go here, you do these, you go to
these ones, you go to these ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after you get to all four,
you go back to the beginning and you try
[SPEAKER_02]: one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it goes, you get like one little
blast out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you jump onto the second can and you
do those same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyrrex dish with a double burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a camp griddle that we used on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a flame one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a flame one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Electric griddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the electric griddle would work as
a double burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you'd have the water in it and
whatever, uh, below the pyrex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hand whip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water would be hot and it would warm
up the butane so it would bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very slowly warm up the butane and it
would burn the butane off and you'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: left with the butter that you'd whip at
the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we, yeah, I think that was like
pre-shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the original was the butter and,
uh, on like a Pyrex square dish,
[SPEAKER_01]: correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would get slabs that you would
peel off and it was super turpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny thing is, is my buddy came
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was like, man, that stuff's so
toxic and gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe we use PVC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably poisoned ourselves and all our
friends and blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he came back in 2015 had gotten
these tests run on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, he'd been, he made a batch and
then wanted to test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, PVC, bro, I can't smoke
PVC, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hella bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of talk shit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came at me with a COA where he had
every possible test run and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: things, zero butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he's like, told you so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I don't know, but like
definitely plastic PVC is not the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: blast people to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked a lot of it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I didn't smoke too much of that and
I didn't want to share the tech because
[SPEAKER_01]: those were real people blowing themselves
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my first experience was just on my
patio, on my deck, my condo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used a turkey baster at the grocery
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like a metal turkey baster,
like a high quality one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then used a hose clamp with a,
with a coffee filter on the bottom open
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just put the thing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pack the turkey baster full of the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then just put the butane on
the top end and it passed through all the
[SPEAKER_01]: butane and it would leak into the Pyrex of
the coffee filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gravity would go through it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have your liquid in there and
then you just put it in the, it seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: hella work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it was like small batch,
just like trying to make some oil for dabs
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time, you know, and then it's just
experimenting is just like, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: ingenious though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's, I mean, that's,
you know, that's the way it's way better
[SPEAKER_02]: than PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the same, in the same note,
it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it was actually really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pack the thing, put the hose clamp in
coffee filter and the hose clamp held the
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee filter and then the butane in the
top, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it usually squirts out and it would
just pass through and it would drip in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would go into the bowl and the
bowl was in the hot water just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the whipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was terpy and it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for being a 1.0 version of
something that's now turned into my heart
[SPEAKER_01]: was always racing doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't like the fact that the gases
and everything, I was definitely always on
[SPEAKER_01]: edge doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wore a mask when I was doing,
I always, there was people that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that blew themselves up shortly after we
started and I was like, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: blow myself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got given the tech, I was given it
with a lot of warning and I just didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to live with sharing it with someone
and them having something to do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just like left it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over the next years it obviously
evolved to what it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of just stuck with bubble hash
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you smoke it when you first
started doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you smoke it on coal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you heat the coal up and then use a
straw or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we either put it in,
were we dabbing then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're almost dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back then we were smoking our bubble
hash in a Ruer bong from Germany and we
[SPEAKER_01]: use these angle bowls and they would be
smoked on a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we would put like the oil on ash
and then use a hemp wick and light it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that, or we would just like mixing
it in our joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we might have a titanium nail by
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly when the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a while after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I think it was like maybe 2005 or six
that I remember dab rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was a little after that even,
but titanium nails were the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we were, I was, I don't
think I was quite using a titanium nail
[SPEAKER_01]: then, but I knew people who were,
and I wasn't, I wasn't about it with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the quality of the, just knowing the
butane and everything else wasn't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just sussed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally trust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I'm like, I knew it got me
really high though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I was definitely, I'm like,
we don't know what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what heavy metals are left
in this and I don't trust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to just.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came from the world of hot knives,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you do the hot knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably hot knifed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot knives were the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the bubble hash wooden hot
knife had burned off before you could get
[SPEAKER_02]: a real hit because it was too liquidy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always did the old school, like
Moroccan style, but like the classic hash
[SPEAKER_02]: that they made in Humboldt, we could,
we could hit the hot knives and just get
[SPEAKER_02]: wrecked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hot knifing right up until dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now obviously I was doing it way less,
but like whenever like there was that
[SPEAKER_01]: person that just wanted to get like the
extra high, we bust them out and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you know, the flowers just aren't
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do it, but like, it was like,
once a year maybe, you know, gravity bongs
[SPEAKER_02]: gravity bongs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, as I was talking to a guy today,
he's like, those gravity bongs are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aren't gravity bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the real gravity bongs have a,
have a valve and they have water in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's time to do it, you,
that water goes down and that took it
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly slammed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hold the thing up and then,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, that's the real gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, you tap people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would never want to smoke again
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they did their first time, they
probably wouldn't want to smoke again.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's interesting how like,
that was like fun for us back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really think about it,
it's not the way you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want people to.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but that goes into the explorer part
of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, you know, the guy who wants
to try or go on the adventure of different
[SPEAKER_02]: methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like some of these guys
smoke out of apples and watermelons and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever else to go to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they want to go through those
phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, for me, that was fun when I
was younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even bongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I still smoke a bong, but not all the
time, but like I have a bong ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still enjoy the bongers, but I don't
enjoy the seven footers or the four
[SPEAKER_02]: footers anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even it's like a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm more referring to like
beginner smokers who get deterred from
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking by people who kind of mess them up
with too strong of a dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I'm meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, they could be potentially
consuming a substance that could make
[SPEAKER_01]: their every day or every week life better,
but they're so scared of it that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't even, they won't even try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we know all the people like
this and that's something I think we
[SPEAKER_01]: should all try not to do it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we do it unintentionally,
like with these slurpers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these dabs now are pretty potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of potent ways to smoke now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for, if you're a real smoker,
there's ways to get there and very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the fact that there's mild
edibles that people are taking small doses
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, cause we didn't measure
anything back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, how much shit can we put
in this brownie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do edibles for time because of
how, what we did to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until there was actually
milligrams on items and I would like very
[SPEAKER_01]: cautiously tried them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I built a confidence for it that
I was scared from edibles completely,
[SPEAKER_01]: just from what we'd done to each other in
the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally where you're tripping for a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like literally what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Reggie on the river, eating a
whole dude, whole one whole brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably like a 500 or 700
milligram brownie and having like trippy
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a huge part of it is a fight or
flight response, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you try fight a buzz that's already
going to happen, you got to kind of ride
[SPEAKER_01]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once you accept it in your head and
you can just enjoy the buzz for what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, then it's dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're sitting there trying to
fight something that you can't beat,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be a long journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a struggle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of life lessons from
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They relate to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think, yeah, accepting,
accepting everything, especially when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're tripping, dude, like you definitely
have to just breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let another join up, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you having a bunch of pre rolls
here, too, my man.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The California hospitality has been next
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only been here for a few days in New
York, too, like considering it has the rep
[SPEAKER_01]: it does of people being mean and nasty in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had such a nice response out there and
met so many really great people,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially like hash makers and growers
and just like the level of passion because
[SPEAKER_01]: of like the hardships of where they came
from, because of how illegal it was is is
[SPEAKER_01]: really always cool to see in all walks of
life, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the most passionate, awesome people
come from the hardest, most illegal places
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always from humble somewhere so free,
you know, where someone's from,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of in Florida or New York or
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still got the accent, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed, it wasn't all New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's another New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most stubborn guys arise from New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting because they've had to deal
with a lot, I guess, or maybe and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge city.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's great that much flair
legalization has really happened over
[SPEAKER_02]: there and I feel like they're doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very much agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from back in the day where they
could stop and search you for no reason at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being from the West Coast of Canada,
New York has always been the top buyer for
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've always paid more than anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You knew if you were tapped into the buyer
circles, there was always one guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: knew a New York buyer and they would pay
more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way it worked when the Beaster
days were going on is LA saw or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the West Coast saw most of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And New York saw like another level of
gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Toronto would see like whatever
was left over just because of the dollar,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually as the Beasters slowed
down, a lot of that was trying to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed to New York, but I don't think they
took a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it went to Chicago from what I
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it started to just go east to
Toronto and like further east across
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the people are still growing all
this large amount of volume and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what the fuck are we going to do
with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Toronto went from like not like getting
like those juices and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_01]: not really knowing what good flour was to
being some of the most picky people around
[SPEAKER_01]: because they slowly but surely as the
border tightened, they started getting all
[SPEAKER_01]: the gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they get it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have producers growing really good
flour now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say Toronto gets like a huge
portion of like the best flour that's
[SPEAKER_01]: grown in Canada because they have the
biggest population and buying power.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make more money there than anywhere
in Canada, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about Skittles earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else are you guys getting up there
genetics wise?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not a lot of real Skittles in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can count on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of people that I would can
reach out and know that they're sending me
[SPEAKER_01]: real Z and even I'd say half those five
aren't even the original cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a Z one off Z cross or
something or a very Z leaning cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rainbow belts 2.0 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the belts that I'm finding in
Canada aren't very Z leaning at all
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of them either didn't know
what to hunt for when they hunted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they've never seen the real Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you know what to hunt for?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go for looks then, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's a grow or probably biomass.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you want the candy, but then the
candy one doesn't have a good structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anytime you breed with Skittles,
they breed towards the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that's going to be real skittly
goes hand in hand with the structure
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not quite as nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little looser.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes don't form up on it quite as
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a pheno hunter, it's a lot of the
characteristics you're not going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for except for the profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one is if you're going for the
Skittles, you have to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more than anything because it's not
about the looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about the vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But finding something in the middle or
that blends good with Moonbow from
[SPEAKER_02]: Archive, that one's fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the belts was what it was,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm fortunate enough to have that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting story how I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: During COVID, someone from New Mexico said
they're going to send it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then out of nowhere, it showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had to mail him something back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I couldn't really get to the post
office in Nanaimo because anyways,
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID stuff, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up getting him some seeds
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I have a good rainbow belts cut
from a solid dude that sent it from New
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Z, I had to get back myself in
other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have both those cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably two of my favorite
strains we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big part of that is because during
when I went to Amsterdam last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do much hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a new grower take over my facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just kind of happy with my 30 to
40 cultivars, keeping them alive versus
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cross them and log a whole fino
hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a little bit behind on a lot of my
hunting right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, this last year,
all the seeds we made, I gave a bunch away
[SPEAKER_01]: in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing a huge hunt now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're back on it this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I took a year off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I realized is I actually kind of
felt two years behind because I felt a
[SPEAKER_01]: year behind that I didn't hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it takes another year to hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually felt two years behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lesson here is don't ever stop
hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever stop hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep it going for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're going to rely on other
people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did you start breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've been making seeds for a
while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1999 we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2015, I started to go to Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw there was a void in Canada of
lack of genetics from all my growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like we had the quality of
growers seeing how long we've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we were lacking was the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took it upon myself to go to Emerald
Cup and first go to different dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: and figure out what genetics I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then figure out who bred those
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I made my list and went to
Emerald.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bought the genetics directly from
said breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ONI, Exotic, Canorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the first people I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some of them I'm forgetting too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Capilator as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get different results from
different breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I got the results I liked,
I started to go more to those breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year also I started to
realize that everybody was kind of on the
[SPEAKER_01]: master train.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching the breeders and people
with the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they would meet up with each other,
they'd all have these jars in their
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these jars were rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I was like, okay,
this is what all the owners of,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the next wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see that the rosin was the next
wave because it's just the way that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosin happened real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made that cold room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even had a partner back when I was
doing this Temple Calix thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that rosin wasn't going to become
anything because the parchment was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to leave material in the thing and just
going to wait for time until that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: found out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of believed what he said for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as I went to spandibus that year,
I met Matt and Joel from Sasquatch at
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain Hunters Club and they showed me the
whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three months later I had a new
Sasquatch in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of the first people in,
a few people that I knew that knew how to
[SPEAKER_01]: press didn't have their own presses and
they also didn't have their own materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was doing, I just had these guys
that knew how to press come over and do
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For basically for us, like I would give
them the oil for pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd give them a percentage of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had all this extra biomass to press,
flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would just come over and they
would press and they'd get some and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just extra biomass anyway,
like smalls or like stuff that I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: need or like just product that wasn't
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from there I saw the hash rosin
being the next wave and I just got into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first thing I did was enter Masters
of Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built a cold room in like November and I
entered Masters in March.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got fourth place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like the huge, that's where I
met like Frosty and Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I already met Lorenzo a year before,
but that's where like competing with them
[SPEAKER_01]: and being at the events at Masters and
being at the dinners and just being part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the whole process was where you really
build these relationships that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: like legendary, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now here we are six years later and
I'm gonna go visit Frosty this week up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, it's just so cool,
like full circle, the whole experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This community is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're exclusive in some ways,
inclusive in other ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the inclusive part where
everybody's part of a bigger community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, there are exclusive
areas of the community as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with genetics, people with really good
flower and then people without,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's very exclusive still at the very
top, that 0.1%, not even the 1%,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the 0.1% of the flower and the people
that everybody knows each other on that
[SPEAKER_02]: level too, I think pretty much,
or knows you through somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I like that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the very good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking the best flower possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like most people don't even get
to appreciate the flower that we get to
[SPEAKER_02]: see on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's always something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I feel absolutely blessed to be,
to have smoked the flower and to gain the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that I have, like even just
this past Master of Rosin in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got people from all over the East
Coast, with all their different palettes
[SPEAKER_01]: and their different stories and
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them are from Cali and some of
them are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them have been there the whole
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just really cool to see their
journey and what they hunt and why they
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the whole experience is really
cool to see all the different walks of
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why spandibus is so important
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all these different passions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a guy came second place in the
organic cup with some of our genetics he
[SPEAKER_01]: bought off us the year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to have a German guy win a cup in
Spain from genetics from Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I got from Cali, just the whole
story, the whole thing is like so cool for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like, wow, just to be a part of
that is just really special and extra
[SPEAKER_01]: motivating to just keep going and just
keep trying to elevate this as much as I
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a beautiful time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the industry is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone global.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we've lifted the curtains back
and people are showing each other who they
[SPEAKER_02]: really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to do it on a legal level
that was never possible before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like spandibus where we got guys from
Canada, United States, Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand, other Asian countries that I'm
not going to say right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got people from all over coming
over South Africa and Norway and Finland
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sweden and all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all there for the same thing,
for good weed or for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's the weed, the hash,
the friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the Brazil wave this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it was wild.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So South America, I didn't mention that,
but South America, yeah, they're from
[SPEAKER_02]: every country over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chile, Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're in the other countries so we
can mention them because they're in Spain,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like they're doing it in
Brazil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that passion that comes from
places of adversity and struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always the brightest shining
stars.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those guys in the Caribbean are
really passionate about what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got together with Marlon a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which place in the Caribbean?
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went over to St. Vincent and visited
with the Cannabis Authority and we gave a
[SPEAKER_02]: lecture on genetics and pollen mitigation
was part of my lecture to them because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're an island and it's like,
I want to explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first thing I looked at when
I got off the plane is it's such a small
[SPEAKER_02]: island that pollen can flow freely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked to the Cannabis Authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said we're going to be back to get a
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that still hasn't happened,
but it's still something we would love to
[SPEAKER_02]: do in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I made a bunch of banana crosses
actually to go specifically to St. Vincent
[SPEAKER_02]: that are regular seeds and feminized seeds
that I wanted to give out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did legally import seeds into St.
Vincent in 2019.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just hasn't really evolved into
anything much since then?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't evolved with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still there pushing forward and
I'm sure they've gone through their
[SPEAKER_02]: struggles just like Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they medically legal or where are they
at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost better when it's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as the rec comes in, you get these
corporate people and it becomes a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different ball game.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least medical, you can have it for the
right reasons for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, the Canadians keep fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do to fuck it up this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the LPs that are going into
places and taking over and doing a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting a bad name on the whole
industry for taking public money and
[SPEAKER_01]: losing people's hard earned money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's literally the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these CEOs and these executives
get a payout after for tanking these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and basically lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand corporate business
enough maybe, but that's from my vantage
[SPEAKER_01]: point, what I see time and time and time
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't care about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They obviously care about their
shareholders, but they more care about
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to raise shareholders than actually
maintain the business in which they've
[SPEAKER_01]: bought into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just pump and dump is basically
what it is in most parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that model is not good for business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely not good for small
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the race to the bottom is real in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either pump and dump or long term
race to the bottom to gain market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of those models aren't really
good for.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hurt small business more than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm all about small business because
I'm a small business person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what was so dope about Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's so dope about Spandibus is all
the, especially Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say more than Spandibus because
Emerald Cup was like back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: not now, but like in 2015, 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so cool to see all the small ma and
pa businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of them got run out in the
last five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really sad for I'm sure everybody
around here that knows it more than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's sad for me just some Canadian
come down and see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd have to live at first hand like a
lot of the people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, it's like, I can, I just
empathize as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was so awesome before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was so the Chalice and early
Emerald.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of breeders had distinctly
different seed lines too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think they weren't all breeding the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of diversity within the
different seed companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA, if you wanted some sort of like fruit
or really sweet stuff, TGA had some really
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was TGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Green Avengers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Subcool and Ms. Jill back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all the homies, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavenly Days from Canada Rowe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to shout him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was really, really close to Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was Sonny Chiba.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Ray Odey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray from Homegrown Natural Wonders and
Shane from Sonny Chiba.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Pat and there was all these
amazing guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the guys that I'm pretty good
friends with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were breeding and dude, they emerged
out of the Subcool era where they were
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing some bomb shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were releasing some cherry cola type
fucking stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pushing the boundaries on flavor,
what you could get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we go through these eras.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Tangy was popular for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the number one Tangy for like
this weird phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the judges, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream had its day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Blue Dream when it was popular was
super popular and people loved growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it looked so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: People loved smoking it and it just,
it's one of those ones that got burned
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clones got blown out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wanted to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're a bad grower, you could get
two pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other strains did Subcool and then
put out other than the cola one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember some like ones that really
stand out?
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Agent Orange that was really
orangey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Agent Orange for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the Doctor Who that's rated from
Homegrown Natural Wonders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, but that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Doctor Who and then he made a purple
Hi-Chew and it was like a Fino that was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it tasted like grape Hi-Chew candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddies in Washington actually had
the cut and they grew it out and gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's so funny when you
don't smoke something for 10 years or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, eight years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go back and you smoke it
again and it's just reminiscent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings you right back instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That real thing you know that you identify
that as exactly what you smoked without
[SPEAKER_02]: that profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, some of those things are
just so nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunks like back in the day, I still
haven't seen skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm trying to get somebody with
the skunk that claims that they have the
[SPEAKER_02]: real skunk on the show and they're going
to bring it and we're going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to tell everybody how it's
either the real skunk or it's not the real
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm super excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing is, is with these genetics
and these claims, I'm not going to doubt
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody, but show me the flower,
show me the proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the real cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what the cat piss, that's another
one because like cat piss is like a very
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubblegum's mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubblegum was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real juicy fruit, the real like
flavorful juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a juicy fruit that was going
around and it was top shelf and it tasted
[SPEAKER_02]: like juicy fruit bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did it look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like fat buds, lime green,
fat buds, lime green, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oval oblong buds, but they were chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like small.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this one was like huge buds,
like a half pound Ziploc is what we use in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: A QP would fit in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't fit a whole half pound in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just so big, juicy, so easy to
trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just like big fingers of just
like, it was very easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd save some seeds and pop seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the seeds kind of gave that juicy
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Vancouver Island thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the late, like 98 was probably the
early 2000s, the last I ever saw it was
[SPEAKER_01]: 01.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we lost a lot of stuff back in the
day that was super special and unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't save clones as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that Hop Layton existed back
then and we just didn't know what it was
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was being far between.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember like some of the genetics
where you'd buy it in the first year these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys were putting it out, it would be
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it went down in
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was the bubblegum did the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think that it's been around a
lot longer than we've thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just said it was weak moms is
what they would attest to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took weak clones or we fucked up when
they were moms and passed it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I honestly think Hop Layton
could be alive a lot longer than we had
[SPEAKER_02]: given it credit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very valid point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It decimates gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense to what happened to that
strain and probably many others that were
[SPEAKER_02]: just sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many others where it's like they
dug out and we didn't even understand
[SPEAKER_02]: dudding diseases back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just we weren't that scientific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you can test for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really good labs and there's
some not so good lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to start working with
the lab in Canada called High North.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also working with a hopefully LP
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be a lot of data
collecting on like the outdoor versus
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: LED versus HPS and different mediums,
super soil versus living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're trying all this stuff and
collecting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the hash and the hash from all
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like what I'm working towards,
hopefully with the group in the next like
[SPEAKER_01]: one to three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're talking to the right group
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's why we're going to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny because we use data to track
software.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using Phenom one and that's from
Phenom networks that are Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the perfect plug for them,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so we basically use it for
inventory system where we create genetics.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so we inventory stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We create crosses with it and then we do
variety testing where you put it out in
[SPEAKER_02]: different regions in different climates
and we collect several data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at originally like 53 and
then it was 63.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's about 72 different data
points that we'd like to collect for each
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often do you collect those data
points?
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it certain ones at different times?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the beginning, there's one that
basically you measure growth and like
[SPEAKER_02]: we're actually getting tape measure out
there doing it like you would in Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But measuring growth and then weighing the
plants whole, weighing the plants dry and
[SPEAKER_02]: wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to give that
information, also weighing the main cola,
[SPEAKER_02]: what that yields, I think that's a super
important piece of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also doing this in indoor and
two environments with the same genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that are commercial environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can compare everything with COAs at
the end as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get COAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go, OK, this genetic works best
here, here and here, or it only works best
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other things are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can really start identifying your
lines is kind of what we're really looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bunch going on all over the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably I don't know if this would
apply with what I got going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will definitely ask you some more
questions after the podcast because I got
[SPEAKER_01]: probably like two different spots in
Thailand that are hunting and then some
[SPEAKER_01]: spots in Spain and some spots all over the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a few in B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: is obviously as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and like summer greenhouse,
summer outdoor, summer indoor LED,
[SPEAKER_01]: summer HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of all over the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are rock wall, some are most are soil
and living soil.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I want to have some sort of data
tool to pull them all into one thing would
[SPEAKER_01]: be good right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a thing called OneNote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly use that with my washing,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not using much as much data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collecting as I should be after reading
your book on the just all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomes and just all the different data
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing nearly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mostly hunting on profiles personally,
because that's what I've hunted in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But moving forward as I start crossing the
profiles I like with other profiles I
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'm going to definitely want to get
more into the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes years to get to there,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, the first year you don't get a
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really that like the second year,
the third year, it compounds over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you get into it or what you put
into it, you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more data you have and the more
like, dude, you start seeing trends and
[SPEAKER_02]: you really see what is dominant as far as
traits once you're using the same thing
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over through multiple lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you pick your matches better moving
forward and you waste less time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wasting less time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the potential for this
software is that they have AI algorithms
[SPEAKER_02]: that they can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like predict type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predictive modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you can do predictive modeling if
you have a starting point in the finish
[SPEAKER_02]: where you where you want to see the plant
go or where you know what kind of traits
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for, breeding for specific
traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do predictive modeling now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mind is blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's so amazing because really
breeding for specific goals for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, regions and climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you find your traits that you want,
like your profiles and then you can go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you look at where you want the plant
to go and then testing stuff in the those
[SPEAKER_02]: regions and then being able to push the
plant in those directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for you as a hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wash ability and like how likely is when
you cross things that do wash with things
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How likely do those traits pass over and
unlikely?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on that right now,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a bunch of washers that we're
going to be testing and then crossing them
[SPEAKER_02]: to genetics to find new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we have 10 tents during the process
of figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just in the, dude, that's absolutely
one of the things that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working with Jason Hutto from house of
cultivar, and we're doing this really
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking cool washer project that we're
going to be testing this stuff and also
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding autos that wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big part of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the time is now for that all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially here in the west coast where we
got a limited, especially up north where
[SPEAKER_01]: we have limited summer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, great climates over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hash is definitely on everyone's
radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the waves coming in with devices
like the puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only going to help break the stigma
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Franco's main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're all here to help do
is push Franco's agenda moving forward is
[SPEAKER_01]: help break the stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's helpful for all of us and
especially for the people that want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a lot of people don't want to
smoke because they're afraid of the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be the light they'll be cast
under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And torches weren't good for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we break the stigma, there'll be
less of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all these new ways to smoke is
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consuming is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the rosin carts now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the rosin carts are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when you're getting the flavor and
the pull and, you know, I don't like the
[SPEAKER_02]: two gram carts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be like, I wouldn't mind if
they had half gram carts actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, they do for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my friends always give me carts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because like there's they last too
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because the flavor isn't good after
the first half gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it heats up over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oxidization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, dude, like I heard about five
gram pins now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosin vape already has to be heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike distillate, distillate doesn't have
to be heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already gone through its process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rosin has to be heated to get into
that viscous state in most cultivar cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably also a contributing
factor as to why this shelf life wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be as long as because the product's got to
be kind of heated up to even be in a vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: White Thorn Rose is a new one I had in a
rosin cart not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's purple extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's purple rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like flower petals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inosilin right in the trichrome head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw a picture today at this place I
was at and they showed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropcookies is usually the strain,
the cultivar that is the cause of the
[SPEAKER_01]: inosilin in the trichrome head.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know any others.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on that?
Tropcherry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got super sick of it because it's
like a harsh citrus flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the same type of thing that
gets people's attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you look back to Mimosa,
which was a super popular one for time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one was a popular one that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that same sort of flair to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, like I said, I was done with
Tropcookies, but like it just won ego as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's blended with the Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like the Tropcookies'
offensiveness is kind of dumbed down a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Z, it comes up and so they
kind of balance out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you that like wow factor,
but without like the super harshness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the super boof I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that trichrome tortoise has been
winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The super boof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a weird one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at first I was like, well I'll chop
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as I got into it, I was like,
okay, I see why it's getting people's
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see why it's winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purple adds another visual aspect
of it that like just gives it another
[SPEAKER_01]: mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people want to buy purple stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That super boof is the super yielder too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like four pounds per.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the flower side.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four per light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you could throw some
favins in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably get five.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the under lighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: The under canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about under canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen my friends crush it with the
under canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the percentages you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the average.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even like 15%, one of my friends,
but like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in greenhouses is where it's going
to be like really a game changer.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause dude, there's so many smalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get rid of your smalls in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're talking about better urban if
you have good color as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm trying to understand why the
greenhouses does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that cause like.
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's cause the sun's moving like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not getting consistent light all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having a breakthrough glass or
plastic or whatever too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that you're not getting the full
PPFD of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking cause the sun is better,
but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you do get sun plus the under
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're bumping your.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably your supplementary lighting in
there will also have a big factor to how
[SPEAKER_01]: much the percentage gain is I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're, they're inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The under canopy lights are inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get them for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've seen from the dad,
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be, well, I guess it
will be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of times we wash the smalls
and now the smalls are going to be too
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to want to wash them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing is, is like, and I haven't
proven this myself, but smalls going down
[SPEAKER_02]: to 5% or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you just put them at the base of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you don't have to thin your
canopy out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff grows out in a nice chunky
purple buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's purple wheat, normally it's green
with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets the light spectrum is really good
for really red or purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the red in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My LEDs do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about that red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the led company that you choose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're using science right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have the dragon alpha adjustable
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The app that you use is simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had a Canadian company called alias.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've treated us very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure they're just using the
Samsung dial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everybody else, but they're good
people and they've treated us very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love that Samsung.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the LEDs that are good have the
Samsung.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the base of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got any trips coming up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trips coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a bunch actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I got to go back to Amsterdam,
see Soma in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I got to tie up some loose
ends from some seeds, people who live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got to go back for the Berlin
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to Berlin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so busy here, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to, I'm planning on a trip
to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, maybe the Caribbean cup guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got invited to the Caribbean cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's two cups over there that are
happening and I'm super excited about both
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caribbean's a great place to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just people happy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to the Caribbean in a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to go there, part of the reason I don't
go to the Caribbean is cause usually
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not very weed friendly places
other than Jamaica, but I've been to
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica so many times I need to like go to
other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica is great though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with Thailand, the way the
legalization is bro, like it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food there is so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's beaches and it's like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the weeds getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at first it was like a lot of import
and super expensive, but now there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: good local grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can tap in and you can,
there's a rosin scene now and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all, it's all there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Thailand's definitely high on my list
as far as places I'm going to be spending
[SPEAKER_01]: time unless they like hardcore change the
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nowhere else in the world where
someone like myself can still be yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: because like I'm a broker for time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, obviously like I can
do that in Canada, but I have to do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: like the LP side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, and that means I got to work
with all these suits that I just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just like so hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just lying every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no transparency in what
they're talking about at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like when someone tells me something
that I'm actually being what they say and
[SPEAKER_01]: not some other smoke and mirror stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I guess it's possible at every
level, but, uh, just with the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: shops and the amount of grows and the
amount of like just everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for someone, there's just more
opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I don't see anywhere else in
the world where there's that much
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity unless they change the laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with the amount of people,
the amount of tourists that come through
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you draw, I think it's like a 200
mile radius around Thailand has more
[SPEAKER_01]: population from a two hour flight than
anywhere else in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why they have so many
tourists there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's like easy to fly to from
all these different countries,
[SPEAKER_02]: from Japan, from wherever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and Russia and India too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not forget about India.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big population.
Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a bunch of land race seeds just
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You met Fritz probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds really familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the strain hunter, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a, he's a, yeah, he goes around and
collecting, he collects seeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and does his thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're working on some projects
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they from Thailand?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are from Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are from India, from the Kush
mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has like some, yeah, some like chaurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: When are you going to start popping them?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're popping them as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you have to do anything crazy to
pop them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to like add that other,
what was that solution I was learning
[SPEAKER_01]: about your book?
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to use GA3 for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ones are, these aren't, these are
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the embryo rescue, you can do
the embryo rescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reading on that book of yours,
that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the support, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book's been an adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went live on Amazon yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton to learn in there for every
level of everything in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to learn in that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to make it something for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's in depth enough to
where everybody can benefit in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a collective effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it wasn't just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bunch of other people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the case studies too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The case studies are super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep it real with the case
studies, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And get the real story from the real
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wrote things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause with the case studies, some of them
I wrote a certain way and then I sent them
[SPEAKER_02]: to the people and they were like,
no, that's not what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, so this is what I had heard
and this is what the truth is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you wrote it, you did their
version rendition of each one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from the source, I got as close to
the source as I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's a lot of, it's like the
PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, and then the people, when they talk
about it, like you, they are so certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no, there's no area of
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they tell the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a version, maybe someone's got a
different version, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to as close to the source and
verified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause even with stories over times,
the stories tend to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a good PIF story from a,
from a real New Yorker, a New Yorker when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in, when I was in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the PIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PIF that I saw was like these little
pinky little like, like almost like turd
[SPEAKER_01]: looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then it was just, it was hazy for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a haze, like a typical haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing, nothing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the PIF that I've had is like a haze,
but it's more mellow of a turp and not
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the, it doesn't burn your nose
sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it wasn't more mellow haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like Congo or like, no,
no, no, it was, it was chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high is more chill for me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Cuban black haze was stronger,
but I liked the PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually liked the flavor on the PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke it down to the Roach if it's
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it, it definitely is uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the high is really clean
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it opens my eyes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't fucking tighten my eyes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a nice daytime buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see that's why New Yorkers like
it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could, you got to kind of be alert in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just be Coachella baked and walk
around that city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to know it doesn't lock,
knock you out like the Durban does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still want to, you know,
take the edge off a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see why that's popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: The show to Golden State, banana Nick for,
for taking me around and introduced me to
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy with the PIF and like,
he's been out there for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure his Golden State
bananas, banana OG, a cut of banana OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been rocking it out there,
doing it, coming back with a vengeance
[SPEAKER_01]: after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see people reinvent themselves and
crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's a bunch of fighters in
this industry, you know, who aren't going
[SPEAKER_02]: down no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's just putting one foot
in front of the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of giving up hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a lot of, I mean, there's times where
it's easy to sprint and it's easy to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other times where you're walking
up the mountain and it seems like the
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain is so far away, the top of the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just got to put one foot in front
of the other until you get over the
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking hump.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think life is all about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just getting up and showing up for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow is a new day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not a good one today,
we'll try to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you just got to show up for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, self-care is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a spiritual level and on a physical
level, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really difficult in this day and
age with the distractions we have on our
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: They even be any sort of in touch with
your spiritual level whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting outside, there's all kinds of
important shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think it's just obvious for me,
but it's like going outside, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been so busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a hard time mowing the lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, because I've been so busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I just went home at 630 and went
out and mowed my lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt so good after.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt really good after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's funny because... I'm super
blessed to not have a lawn, but also to
[SPEAKER_01]: live in super nature area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just joking because I don't have to
mow it, but I wouldn't mind a lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it kind of the way we live is not
really like lawn territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I could, but it's more like rocky
and like kind of like rugged trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the beach across the road and
that's where I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go around myself and try to take my shoes
off and walk on the freezing cold sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever do sun gazing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done sun gazing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it every morning.
Honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was in Thailand, every morning I
wake up and I watch the sun come up over
[SPEAKER_01]: the horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do that too.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do it enough because I like when
I'm traveling and like to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, when I'm at home,
I have one, but I wimp out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do like a lot of cold showers and
it's kind of like a process of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so much easier than a cold shower for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like cold showers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the dip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just boom, get it over like a band-aid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm numb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you think about it for about 30
seconds and just breathe and you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing through it and then you get numb
and you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your time that you like to do a
cold plunge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Six minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to vote five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, so I don't do as cold as I used
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do 37 degrees and now I do like
50.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 is just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go, I could do 37, but I feel like
50 is good and I get out of there and I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel super refreshed and I don't take
forever to warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I go 37 degrees for five minutes,
it takes me a lot longer to warm up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that big of a deal,
but I feel like I get the real benefit at
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 degrees, like 50 degrees for six
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get that dopamine kick for all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do in conjunction with sauna as
well, or do you do separate?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been doing the sauna as much
lately, but yeah, the sauna pronounced
[SPEAKER_02]: finish and I am finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Swedish, but sauna is the sauna we
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just learned something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally pronounced sauna,
not sauna.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can do four days a week, 30 minutes,
I like it hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it above like 180.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's like after I work out,
the sauna is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Tofino, I'm really blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of really nice saunas
that are on the beach and then you walk
[SPEAKER_01]: across the beach and just lay in the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's almost torture because the
waves will get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the bigger wave will hit you and then
it will go right over your head sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a whole different type of
like flowy cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have a floating sauna up
the inlet where it's unbelievably
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can jump in the ocean off the
floating sauna.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's funny because when we're in
Seattle, they have a hot tub boats.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's freezing cold water on Lake Union.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go around in the hot tub
boats and hop in and same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually go in the real boats,
but the hot tub boats are pretty cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see people are partying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cold plunge in just the regular boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cold plunge off the side of the
boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that water is super cold up
there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially this time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as you do, so how many days do
you do cold plunge?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how many days do you sauna a
week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably like only two of each,
realistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to do them almost every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal at our place is a bed and
breakfast in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Green Sea to Retreat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did fishing trips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I switched it into like a
cannabis thing where we teach people to
[SPEAKER_01]: make hash and rosin right on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm getting is I'm going to
build a sauna there and I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the cold plunge and sauna right on site
probably by the end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my backyard, I'll be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point I have no excuse not to
do it four or five times a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to talk about it too much on my
show, but I love it and I love heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes you feel good and you want people to
feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole team does it and we all,
everybody feels so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the morale around the house,
cause we all live and work together is
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to get my producer to
jump in the cold plunge, but he's not into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've had a couple of friends on the
show that have stayed at the house where
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got them in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle that was on the show from Kano
Organics, he jumped in the pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in about, he had drank some coffee
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you might not want to drink
coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: He drank coffee anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goes out to the cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get in and I'm like, yeah, I just sit
here, you know, five minutes and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: was 48 degrees that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 47 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got in and started shaking a little
bit, just dunked down to his neck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, fuck this jumped out,
ran in the house and took a hot shower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a big 700 gallon above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, next time I come, we'll go,
we'll do it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a good cold plunge and I haven't
done it this trip and I wanted to do it in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking for a spa, but I couldn't
find one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't find one in time, but yeah,
totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys need to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang out and get some good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much stuff to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always an adventure here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, we're close to the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're close to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're close to the close, the Emerald
triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we get a little bit of everything and
you're going all the way up one-on-one and
[SPEAKER_02]: into deep, deep territory going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty, this is the time of year too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the weather's nice right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just the start of the nice
weather.
