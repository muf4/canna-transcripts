[SPEAKER_03]: You could just throw it in the dirt and
piss on it and get five pounds off it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is my good friend Al from NorCal
Genetics, the original NorCal Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go way back 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: How have you been?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you disappeared off the face of the
earth in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just talk about that real quick
because we hadn't talked until after I did
[SPEAKER_01]: the podcast with Cesar, who has now NorCal
Genetics, which is the same name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were definitely the original,
the first NorCal Genetics to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: End of 2018 in November, we had the
campfire come to Northern California and
[SPEAKER_03]: decimate everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred people killed, tens of thousands
of buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost all my buildings, lost everything,
boats, cars, everything I had gained from
traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Traveling around the world, just
everything, clothes, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of had to restart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ended up becoming a single father like two
months later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like lose all your stuff,
then lose half your kid and your wife,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, deal with all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's been rebuilding, trying to
take my land back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: After the fire, like just trying to slowly
climb the mountain back to where I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to just take some time off.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wildlife was just too crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to kill all my social media,
phones, just everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You completely unplugged.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, I completely unplugged.
[SPEAKER_03]: For years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty impressive actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: For four years I did that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of people I love, bro,
you included.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I needed to focus and my kid was not
even barely two yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 18, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of like I needed to,
that was, well no, that was the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then 19, yeah, he would have been four
at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then, yeah, being a single father,
I homeschool my child as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point I'm in the process of
teaching him how to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: My animals, I saved all of my dogs and all
but two of my cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a big farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had ducks, chickens, geese, pigs,
all that had to stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I opened the doors, they run off
into the forest or whatever, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: none of them survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And having, I'm kind of hard headed with
my love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all these animals and I love them
like my children.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fire happens and I have this big
farm with this working infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can manage having all these animals
with this working infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got automatic feeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got automatic waterers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a cannelling system for the dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got all these systems in place to
be able to just be me on the farm and also
[SPEAKER_03]: take care of all these animals in a
righteous way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after the fire burned down all my
infrastructure, now life's much harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a working well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go down to town to get water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to pour water into, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to run generators.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to pour gas in the generator three
times a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to every gallon of water that comes
out of my sink or my bathroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to move a big travel trailer up and
everything, you know, everything I have to
[SPEAKER_03]: put in there, you know, I have to,
you know, the dogs and all the cats as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just became too much, you know,
with everything that I was doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't, I couldn't righteously look at
myself and say, okay, well you have time
[SPEAKER_03]: to maintain all of these friendships and
networks and you have time to get taken up
[SPEAKER_03]: by like nonsense on YouTube or you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I needed, I can't do it
part-time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to cut it cold turkey and like just
super focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helped me progress farther and faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was lonely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sad, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was able to kind of crawl out of
that and about six weeks ago now,
[SPEAKER_03]: two months ago, maybe I turned it back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't made any announcements or
anything yet, but I've just turned it back
[SPEAKER_03]: on and then reached out to all the
individuals I wanted to reconnect with and
[SPEAKER_03]: slowly on the kind of let them know what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I haven't been able to connect and
whatnot, but like, hopefully that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: the case anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I talked to you for the first
time in four, four years, four and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years, you were in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've done, you know, you've been
planning all these things and it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: very strategic about what you've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the last four years, also while doing
that, I've been trying to find the right
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we all know, those of us that have
been in this in a long time in the pre
[SPEAKER_03]: medical, medical, like all of that,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the, the knowledge that we have from
doing something for 20 years, the skill
[SPEAKER_03]: sets that we have, there are wanted
skillset, you know, but necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: whether you not, you have the right
funding or investment strategies or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, to get the right licensing and
whatever state, a lot of it's luck of the
[SPEAKER_03]: draw.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it's just big money, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you have enough money,
but not enough money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think you should be able to open up a
business, but because of regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: costs, blah, blah, blah, or in my case
here in California, like my County is
[SPEAKER_03]: locked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to ever let anything in
ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll continue to try to be like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I have to look outside my County
and then when you have places where
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll have like moratoriums or you have
to buy the property first and then make an
[SPEAKER_03]: application, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's non-refundable and can say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm in on this property for how
much money now land is expensive here in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So before you even get to even start
talking about real licensing and setting
[SPEAKER_03]: up the infrastructure of a business,
you're already in half a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've been a self-sufficient guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been friends for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longer than that, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been a self-sufficient guy from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've been into genetics for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We partied all over the world together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, so it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a huge barrier for entry
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how much you care about
quality and you know, there's definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: financial barrier for entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so Thailand, tell us about
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before I even get to Thailand,
I want to tell you, so I really looked,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really looked and the, but the problems
are, is that like guys like me,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the guys that ended up opening
these places, there's all, they need,
[SPEAKER_03]: they need the weed guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil to oil guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They need that, but they're dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't get that much money being
straight up good businessman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are cutthroat businessmen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know how to do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've watched friend after friend after
friend in our position, similar position,
[SPEAKER_03]: make deals with people, get fucked out of
things, have bring in entire crews and
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics lace out full farms and
greenhouses to have the doors locked with
[SPEAKER_03]: armed guards two weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that in multiple, you know,
we were talking about Django earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a great story about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've lost some good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have, but you know, there's all
these bullshit deals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I've been kind of, I've been made
some, I've had some offers made and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of been weaving my way through it,
trying to find the right situation and
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up going to Washington, not last
year, but the year before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Northwest Cannabis Rent went up there
and helped run that place for like four
[SPEAKER_03]: months, our warehouse manufacturing
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried to work out a ownership deal right
there for a percentage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't see eye to eye after the four
months, but I was commuting up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week I was going up and back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 13 hours one way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So 26 hours of my week was just driving
there and back, but it was all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I took off, I took off a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And starting to get a little bitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting to get a little sad, starting to
like, how can I have all this knowledge,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these skill sets, all this network,
all these friends that are like at the top
[SPEAKER_03]: level, at the top of the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't seem to make that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it starts to get disheartening
after a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I really wanted to try to,
to figure out the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my buddy Vinnie gave me a call.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to be one of the partners for
NorCal Genetics back when we were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: our thing over in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, dude, you know what's been
going on in Thailand, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, you need to get out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, you need to absolutely get out
there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to go out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is back in like December.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I was like, all right,
I'm going to try to get out there in
[SPEAKER_03]: January.
[SPEAKER_03]: January didn't end up working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He calls me back.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, did you go out to Thailand?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go out to Thailand,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, hang the phone up with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get on the fucking online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go order yourself a ticket and get over to
fucking Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, all right, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I fucking hung up the phone with him,
took a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, fuck, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me look at my fucking calendar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me move some things around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard for me to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to go out, I'm going to go
out for a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going out to talk to anybody that
I know or I didn't even think about
[SPEAKER_03]: reaching out to anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thought didn't even cross my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out there completely with a blank
slate.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal was I'm going to do the entire
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to every corner of the
country, all the major cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to see what the legalities are
like in those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is actually on the ground happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that to every country that's
legalized so far except Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to every single country that's
legalized or done medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I do what I call a boots on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Portugal was the first time I went out to
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, OK, you decriminalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the real face of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the mission to go out to
Thailand is to basically do three things.
[SPEAKER_03]: To see what the legalities are actually
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: To see if, as a foreigner, I could come in
and legitimately work within the framework
[SPEAKER_03]: of how they're setting up the laws and
everything, whether it's lawyers,
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to find the best place to set up
the first shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to find the best place to put a farm
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with all of that knowledge,
to come up with some kind of package,
[SPEAKER_03]: some kind of fucking thing, and come back
and find some of my boys and get together
[SPEAKER_03]: and say, let's go do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went out there and I did all of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to 700 shops in the first month
that I was out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did another 200 shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: This happened in 900 shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even scratched the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was good to see, OK, what's the
quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you actually have on the shelf?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to look.
[SPEAKER_03]: For really good top shelf, you really have
to look.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, top, top shelf, pretty much
non-existent.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about compared to Amstrad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not comparable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just different, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, I know you've smoked some
Thai strains before.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a different flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it a spice to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any genetics, if it's coming from
Thailand, it has this almost savory,
[SPEAKER_03]: spicy kind of incency kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly what you mean with the
incency with the Thai strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But are they what necessarily everybody
wants to buy, or the tourist, or what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to sell, or whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they compared to California,
to Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go out there, I could
automatically see, I can tell by smelling
[SPEAKER_03]: the weed from the nutrients, OK,
let's say 50% of the total stock in every
[SPEAKER_03]: store out there is imported.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say of that 50% that's imported,
40%, 10%, 35%, 15%, California,
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Amsterdam shit stands out
ridiculously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have their own look.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they elongate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all use mills out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It all has the same smells and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice if you like something mellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're not a proper stoner,
if you're like an old hippie that wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a cup of tea and smoke a joint and do
some shit, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, just like in Jamaica
or any of the other places with high
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity, it's high humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they allow it to ruin all of their
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of all those shops I went to,
maybe three or four of all of those shops
[SPEAKER_03]: actually kept their weed appropriately or
had high-grade hash and kept that
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw one refrigerator with hash in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with good hash in it.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then so all of their flowers,
so they'll grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've met some amazing growers in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a good friend out there and he is,
I would call him my equal in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I can do here with Outdoor and with
Greenhouse in California, he's the
[SPEAKER_03]: equivalent of in Thailand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And amazing fucking grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is after the cure and
curing, they don't do any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: mitigation or any kind of like hardcore
because you need to do hardcore procedures
[SPEAKER_03]: in maintaining that proper cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks up weed or sucks up water out of
the air and then they're putting it in
[SPEAKER_03]: jars and whatever and it's fucking getting
anaerobic bacteria in there and it's cat
[SPEAKER_03]: pissing out and just smells like straight
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the ammonia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that loses its color.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 85, 90% of any weed that you get
sold anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's on a street, on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what this, I don't know if you've
been gone on the scene for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is the Grove Turplock bag right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where you want to cure your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a firm believer.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first I was like, eh, but then we did
side by side compared to jars even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff, as far as curing and they
make these in different, they have tote
[SPEAKER_01]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a bucket guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gram sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a bucket guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to cure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have bucket sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: So literally I have a whole recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This controls the humidity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to control your
temperature down to like 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's technology in the bag for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just a fucking Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a small proof bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not just a small proof bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it is some technology that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much switched over from jars
because we've been using jars forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what there was before we,
there was, you know, do you know when it
[SPEAKER_03]: got ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it back in the day when, when prices
were, you know, 3,800 a pound for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jars were fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and Walmart's around Northern
California would always be out of fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: jars out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to fucking, you had to buy them in
like February, March, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And stock up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you try to buy them at the end
of the summer, it wasn't ever in the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got ridiculous is when one time I
went to a boy's house and I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: Kerr, maybe it's ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a, like a fucking three or five
gallon jar with like a latching top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my boy was putting packs in there and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, okay, bro, this is
getting expensive and ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_03]: but for sure 3,800 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can afford to spend dollars on a jar
or whatever the fuck it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like now it's like, we got $2 to spend on
a Home Depot bucket or back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hardcore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to use a food grade block buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let no light in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the blue ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the black ones as much as
the blue ones where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you hit the lid on the paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are paint ones and they're,
the plastic paint ones and everybody up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt that I used to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to use the special plastic wrench
to get off and it had like rubber seal on
[SPEAKER_03]: the inside and shit like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those were smellproof and you could
stack them in storage units or wherever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I developed a pretty decent curing
system with buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a hang.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do depending on what it is and you know
what I'm doing or whatever, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: certain parts of the process that I'll add
or subtract and then I'll do a hang for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll do a breakdown and then I'll
do a bucket cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I do the bucket cure with tossing
all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way my trimmers are working on all
cured, you know, either I'm going to wet
[SPEAKER_03]: trim and fucking forgo all that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to hang in bags and nets and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if I do my bucket trimming,
the thing that I liked about the bucket
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming is if you're not a poor man,
then at back in the day, you didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: to sit around and wait for everybody to
bicker and let the prices go down and all
[SPEAKER_03]: the craziness to happen in October.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could, you could cure your whole crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then slowly just let, you know,
the trimmers come through.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you could control your trim
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to have 30 fucking hippies
there in a bus going fucking mad and
[SPEAKER_03]: having drama, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to have like six solid
people or 10 solid people, if whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would strip the fan leaves off and
let the sugar leaf protect the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for, for competition shit,
I would hang hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything competition or like super high
grade that I was trying to like keep,
[SPEAKER_03]: I let hang hole to protect.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it became a thing of like,
I need to manage time and I need to manage
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it becomes, okay, I'm going to put
together, instead of having a two man
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest team, that's just basically
hanging, cutting and hanging, cutting and
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring together a four person team.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a cutter, a walker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have somebody like, you get like a,
I love trim pro and they have these nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little table fans that can clip onto
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little, I think they're half horsepower,
one horsepower fucking motor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can just cut down like,
you know, branches and then just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: run them over kind of lightly just to take
the fan leaves off in seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, back in the day when
prices were higher and people can afford
[SPEAKER_03]: to spend money on stupid shit,
then you could have hippies out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: garden, lollipop and defan leaf and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven, six, seven, eight, 10 days,
12 days before harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used to like to do it because it
would stress the plant out and fucking get
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more love on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: More turkeys, more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want a bunch of cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want spannibus cups, you want high
times, cannabis cups.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This hoodie, this is the NorCal genetics
hoodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from our 2012 or 14 spannibus cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was like the first, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 13 actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a 710 technician.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like oil was just like... So I have a
picture with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a picture of us together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other people,
but yeah, I have some good photos of us
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day when you won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, those were good years,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were really good years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that time, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We partied in Spain and Amsterdam a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed that time, but I tell you what,
it'll never happen again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll never ever happen again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was because of all of the circumstances
around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had illegality all around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a man, mostly 99.9%, a man to take
certain responsibilities and actions in
[SPEAKER_03]: this illegal realm that existed,
it took a certain type, personality type
[SPEAKER_03]: mindset, whatever, regardless of culture,
regardless of culture, regardless of how
[SPEAKER_03]: you're raised, regardless of religion,
regardless of race, regardless of age.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was commonalities in these mindsets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here this shining thing was once a
year for an entire week, 10 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a fucking cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: This celebrated cup that everybody around
the world thinks you're going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like the Superbowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the reality is you get there,
it's some fucking background warehouse
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Creeping through alleys and doing like
cannabis coffee shop crawls.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people would go because that was the
only game in town, in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would show up and it was the
most beautiful thing to see a room of
[SPEAKER_03]: bosses, of fucking bosses that run shit in
their respective areas and their towns and
[SPEAKER_03]: their countries and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All alphas and no bullshit, no fucking ego
check.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously there's a little drama and we
get to see it now a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The drama is different now than it was
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you talk shit about something,
you get your ass kicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the friends that got it definitely
kicked other people's asses at cups
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some funny shit though, but like way
different with social media and people
[SPEAKER_01]: talking trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just way different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the whole click baits and all that
bullshit today and all that goes on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was beautiful to see that,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then friendships were forged and
relationships were had and visits were
[SPEAKER_03]: made to other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey bro, why don't you come see how I do
things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you come see how I do things?
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking from the breeders,
from breeders, we knew everybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all knew each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know each other at the fucking top
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were fucking around, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had your genetics in multiple
countries or whatever, we all know who
[SPEAKER_03]: each other are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even most of them, even if you were old
school legends like
[SPEAKER_03]: Blueberry boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who went into, you know, like his shit was
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all knew it here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was often kind of kind of the
cuts for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, when all this
shit opened up, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, pow, he gets to come out and do his
thing or whatever or Shanti, you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same, same, same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good breeders are able to come out and
like, you know, I remember the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: I met DJ short, he told me you need to put
the seed under your tongue and let it
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimate to your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so that it'll respond better to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and there's some crazy stuff he
said, but he was the first person that
[SPEAKER_01]: said that I didn't need to do tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting because tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was super stoked on tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Graham and all that stuff back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, dude, you don't need tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to put your plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it veg out and then take clippings off
that veg plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is truth to what he's saying about
like regenerating the health of a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's very old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we had a whole bunch of friends
and the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was bro science back in the day,
too, and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro science, bro science.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bro science and there was
politics, politics, politics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is number 18 with there's three of
the different phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of the different cultivars that
we've selected in there, and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going through some stuff right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with SF Kana on a 72 seed
phenohunt and really kind of diving into
[SPEAKER_01]: each each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them it's the third time we've
that they've grown it out and you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in the sexual maturity of the
plant and how it's stabilizing and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to grow stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least three times to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they definitely change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're an in guy, just to your
situation and how you do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're you're your own God.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're creating your own environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as genetics, what's your
favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like working with?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like breeding with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've done a lot of breeding over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done a lot of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like cushions and citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like citrusy OGs or like citrusy like
tangies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like citrusy OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I absolutely love tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it was stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it got me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you knock on something that tastes
like frisky orange?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he luck out with that seed pack or
what, bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple tangy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OG Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OG Steve's purple tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got OG Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lucked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he held on to that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go over to a spot, talk to him and
shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our dogs, we had our dogs breed
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has one of my pups and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have like a line of shepherds that are
fucking amazing, fucking, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: royalty, cannabis royalty, shepherds and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about doing some shit for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I go there and he don't give
that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's never gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He held on to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave it to all the wrong people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he has his one partner, right,
who I think gave it to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they got fucked in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's he's had a string of bad
luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a real good person.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, is people take advantage
of good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned that over the years,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like I've been on the
line of where I've been too good of a
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to cut back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pull back in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can always be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to be extremely careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to you got to you got to always
make sure there's insurance policies and
[SPEAKER_03]: that your fucking shit's covered in a real
way when you start committing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, poor Steve, he held on to that
cut for must have been three years before
[SPEAKER_03]: he found the right situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who had land and had commercial
greenhouses, massive commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses, several of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he applied for the permit,
got the permit and but didn't know shit
[SPEAKER_03]: about growing weed and didn't have the
right genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow him and Steve got put together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Steve says, Look, I will bring in my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will bring in my workers to take care of
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did the whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's one of the guys that has that
happened to her two weeks out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They show up in the fucking gates locked
to the farm and they get through the gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the worst stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's armed guards and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you're not getting in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not fucking like, you know,
it's happened to a bunch of our friends
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years and basically cut him out
of 50 percent or whatever the deal was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows whatever the deal was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and that was his big foreign illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the third guy I saw happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another friend of ours, rest in
peace, Django, he he is one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: savvy businessmen that was in this fucking
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was fucking sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was a hustler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a hustler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hustler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a fucking hustler for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking love that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He ran into a situation with like
reservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: With the natives and where they had a
thing where they were going to be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we only have to do by fed law
and we're going to do whatever the fuck we
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we don't know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you come and do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same type of similar situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they locked him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead of fucking like proper
security or on words, they showed up a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of weeks out and there's a bunch of
gangbangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of gangbangers with rifles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking standing in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he told he tells me the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I'm not speaking out of turn,
but he told me the story like as soon as
[SPEAKER_03]: he saw that he knew what was like what
time it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he fucking made sure that he said a
little something to his his man and made
[SPEAKER_03]: sure to take care of things while he went
and talked to the chief.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, went up there and they
were like, yeah, no, you're out of here,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the six months of work and the
fucking 10 employees and the totally and
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetics and the, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people have lost their genetics
and the knowledge, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what's worth a lot of money
is the knowledge.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our knowledge and our skill sets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it in everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what science is, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Science is developing techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you get microspheres or whatever at
certain size or whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to do these set and set of
techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the same thing is in the weed world,
the hash world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know the techniques and you can
make things happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know the techniques,
you ain't going to get it to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these, this knowledge is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been trying to figure out a
way to make the knowledge work,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and not get it stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what everybody's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting their genetics and their
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you got my knowledge, what the fuck
use of my, do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need to make sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I've built your fucking kingdom for
you, you better make sure you have good
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays contracts do mean something to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still will only, you know, I try to work
with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a handshake deal with, you know,
I think that's the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you wouldn't do a handshake deal
with them, why would you do a contract
[SPEAKER_01]: deal if you don't trust them enough?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, let's jump back into Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about Thailand and then we want
to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot to talk about my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Thailand, so, uh, did the work did,
did all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to tell, I'm going to,
this will be the first public telling of
[SPEAKER_03]: this story, but I want it to be out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things, sometimes things happen over
the most ridiculous, innate object.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had meetings in Amsterdam where I've
shared a chocolate mill with somebody and
[SPEAKER_03]: it ended up being, you know, the neck of
the most lucrative thing I'm doing for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next couple of years or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Thailand on my last weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting at a street food cart,
getting, waiting for my fried shrimp to be
[SPEAKER_03]: cooked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: These two guys come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them orders some shrimp and they're
just standing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided, you know, two white guys look
like they're English.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and say some shit to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some little small talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking our time with the shrimp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a little time to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they seem pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seem like smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, when one of them says,
uh, so, uh, you know, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing out here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, you know, tell you the
truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out here looking at the weed game,
kind of see what's available and probably
[SPEAKER_03]: can come out here, open up shop out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just trying to find, uh,
you know, where to open up my shop and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, what the, you know, all the right
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of stop and they both look
at each other and then they just start
[SPEAKER_03]: laughing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, I see my brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, something, something's going
on in a negative way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is me and something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they turned back around and like,
so are we.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, so then that started leading
into a, another conversation and another
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it started leading into like,
Oh, well, who do you know in this area?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like co-signing is happening and
people are reaching out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this guy, you know, that guy,
whatever fucking, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pretty cool shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're repping, uh, turp tenders
shout out to turp tenders out there in,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, England.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, but anyway, so,
uh, you know, over the next couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: months, you know, uh, we've, uh,
wind and dine and romance each other and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, created a fucking pretty strong
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're at the point, uh,
we've got our farm, um, it's in its
[SPEAKER_03]: building phase right now, or a couple of
weeks in, um, I imagine by the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: August, we'll probably have our first
greenhouse up and running, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting, getting, uh, have, or getting
licensing for every single thing out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, we just finished the final
negotiation for our shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a, we got a really nice shop that
we're going to go out there and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, it's going to be a NorCal genetic shop
with, uh, turp tenders, uh, kind of lounge
[SPEAKER_03]: situation in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so that's what we've talked about so
far.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might change whatever, but that's what
we've talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things we want to do is I
want to be able to like represent,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, NorCal companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially like all the OGs that have been
in it for a long time and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the genetics from all of our friends
that have been doing this for decades,
[SPEAKER_03]: not the kids, uh, bless their heart to
coming up with some good shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'll keep doing, uh,
your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you, but, uh, I want to,
I want to reach out to the old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: To those of us who have been doing this
for a minute, you know, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: and help raise them up, you know,
and, uh, get their brands out there and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a space in Thailand where people
can get their shit or see their shit or
[SPEAKER_03]: buy their merch or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta get Steve out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so let's talk about Denver in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, we, we stated that we threw some
parties out of Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honeycomb hideout.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the most epic house as far as
houses that I've rented for cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got together and you've rented,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one with the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a bar that was like 40,
40 feet long.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, there was like 20 stools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was more dab rigs than I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expensive dab rigs lined up on the bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spun fire at that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had such a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the thing was we kept doing all
these shows all around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when stuff started coming out
over here, it was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is, we got to do it by that time
by, uh, by Colorado's, by the time that
[SPEAKER_03]: they opened up for recreation,
uh, we had already won a cannabis cups in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam and, uh, we were on the
specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when Colorado came up, it was like,
Hey, do you guys want to come judge and
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, I got to John got to,
there was like four or five of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I was like, all right,
fuck that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's all pick the different, you know,
good shit, different shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we had to go out there anyway,
like a week early, let's go out there 10
[SPEAKER_03]: days early.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to rent an RV and just fuck
around in Colorado, drive around and eat
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoke and drink weed all the fucking
time and do our little judge kits and the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, I, uh, very meticulously chose
every time that I've been a judge,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a secret judge, like I pick
specifically for the location extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we're in Cali.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our game was stronger than their game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: As, as good, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a period for about two years
where they got a little bit better than
[SPEAKER_03]: us, but not on the whole, we've been
fucking smashing that ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as extract or flower as far as
extract as far as I mean, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick, he's out there, he's from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, I feel like he's
doing some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were transplant from Cali,
then yeah, we're going to, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take that credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was, so that was the year I
entered Holy water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, I was working with Holy water
with Noel and Mike back when everybody was
[SPEAKER_01]: together as Holy water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the judges didn't know how to judge
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember we were pouring, dude,
we, we went through ounces of Holy water,
[SPEAKER_01]: pouring, pouring it out of Tony and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, dude, I, so like when I did Amsterdam,
when I was a secret judge in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I finally got that coveted spot,
I had to win a cup to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I was, that's what I wanted to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't give a fuck about winning a cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on the fucking gallon stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yell at some people party like a rock star
for the night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted, I wanted the ability to be a
secret judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I really wanted because
essentially you're tasting the world's
[SPEAKER_03]: best fucking shit for a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get a box given to you a fucking
absolute, like not what the normal judges
[SPEAKER_03]: for those of you that think you've been a
judge at high times before.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not that it's when you come in like
a week early to high time special,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, crew puts a together boxes and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to go to a safe house and you pick
up your fucking box of drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was all about safe houses
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like literally Amsterdam
was the safe house drop off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, they had that,
they had the house and yeah, I mean those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those were old school, you know,
where it wasn't like, it was still
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still dangerous to a degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took for that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, what does Amsterdam do
the best?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does Amsterdam offer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask you before I tell you,
what does Amsterdam offer there that as a,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a selection that you really can't get
anywhere else, including here in
[SPEAKER_03]: California lounges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as, as far as like a product,
as far as, as far as like one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: competition, so I was, dude, that's a
tough neither, but I think there is better
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and better house than there was back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me throw this out to you.
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have more cities for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right on the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a handful of people doing
sativas here, but it's really,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you know somebody, you cannot get a
sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you go there, you can get proper
sativas all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have a pricing structure that
fucking, that, that represents that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get a 12 or 15 Euro gram of
indica there, but if you want a pure
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa there, you got to pay 20 grams or
20 euros.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like now I think something like that,
maybe it's a little bit more now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, you, you, our economy was based
on illegal economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So how, as a grower, are you going to
fucking keep your lights on in a room and
[SPEAKER_03]: your risk up for an extra, you know,
30 days or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you don't need to, and you're not
going to get more of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So saturated out here that you're,
you're, you typically aren't ever going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get more for sativa than you are for an
indica because they can't sell for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I don't know the pith stuff in
New York, we were talking about pith,
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel, sour diesel is not a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say it's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sour diesel too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, it's interesting because
the structure is very sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effect is some hybrid ish fucking
amazing couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day was couch log weight at
14%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also depends on what sour diesel you
had, whether it was East coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel, which I didn't consider sour
diesel, like even what Amsterdam consider
[SPEAKER_03]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't consider sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like us here in Northern California had
maybe six or seven strains, double bubble,
[SPEAKER_03]: all these, uh, seven times.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are all these differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different little, uh, sour strains and
they were all sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all slightly different,
but like some of them had better yields
[SPEAKER_03]: than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I had one that I grew for about
five years that dude, the, the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: glands on there after, if so I hang dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would put down a Panda plastic
underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I'm moving them and starting
to go, just the tips would be a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: crispy when I'm trying to bucket them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, the hash would fall off,
you know, the resin glands will fall off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally it's like, whatever,
it's just going to be part of the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: dirt on the floor with this particular
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd scrape it up because the resin glands
were full melt out of the fucking gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I would barely have to put it through
a shitty silk screen kefir from old school
[SPEAKER_03]: before they had, Oh, you got to use
micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dude, it would just, you just touch a
lighter to it and it would just pull up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best sour diesel was, where I saw
was that, you know, Sonoma was like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern most part of Sonoma, which is a
Casadero, Josh Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew the best hour diesel back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was outdoor, but it was, I think it
was East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just call it sour diesel, but I think
it was ECSD, but everybody has a different
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion on what sour was, what cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's like, there's crazy
stories about all of them, but the real
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel was the real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only one real fucking super fire
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there was like a lemony, they called
AJ's is what we got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently that's not a true story
that AJ didn't have his own cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was just ECSD or sour D,
but that's a whole nother podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother podcast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to, if you listen to Sonoma
tell the story, no, but Sonoma,
[SPEAKER_03]: his heart is so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what his is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's not really sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's New York city diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the seeds that came from some of
those packs that Don and Aaron got that
[SPEAKER_03]: turned into some of the more citrusy type
of, apparently that's the literally the
[SPEAKER_03]: lion was some of those, I think said from,
from that would be like tangy and shit
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the lemony was straight
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his was a grapefruit fucking massive
Yielder, but nothing like the East coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were both New York, the New York
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sour diesel were so far off
from what I knew is sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the New York city diesel too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a nice fucking grapefruit like
that Ruby red grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love smoking that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I liked the high from the sour diesel
and it used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you up the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 14%, 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit used to wreck you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The steps is 30% today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, ours was a, we had in our area,
a sour bubble was like the biggest,
[SPEAKER_03]: the best one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like four or five good,
really, really good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had, when it cured out, it had,
would have peach colored fair,
[SPEAKER_03]: like very light orange, peach colored
hairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like, you know, like the New
York would be like a darker color hair,
[SPEAKER_03]: like almost like a red hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you could just throw it in the
dirt and piss on it and get five pounds
[SPEAKER_03]: off it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like let alone when you put infrastructure
behind it, that was our blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 pound outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you start to think like,
Oh, you get comfortable with these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've been working with this thing for
so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so prevalent in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be able, if I, if I let it go this
year, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we all have size restrictions on our
mother rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things make the cut, some things
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when things don't start to
perform on the other end, you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, maybe I got to cut you down a little
bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chem sour stuff yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yields fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sourdice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pictures of me from 15 years ago
behind 12 foot sourdicell plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what else, you know,
it was a massive one with the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: plants I've ever seen was a afgoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afgoo is fired.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got fucking massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think people, a lot of people
don't even know the real afgoo that we got
[SPEAKER_01]: to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that afgoo, that sweet afgoo that
was like frosty as frosty could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was as white as white could get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was like, it was like white as
indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We literally sold that shit as indoor bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: People didn't care though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing is, is like, honestly,
even today, if you had that people
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't care, they would pay you indoor
prices for that shit if you grew it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was also spongy cause it was oily
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, we weren't even fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw 15 pounders on the regular with that
and I saw an 18 pounder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I did personally, but fucking one
of my boys did a fucking goddamn orange
[SPEAKER_03]: tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they grew, they did a technique where
like they pushed them down with water
[SPEAKER_03]: every day and they grew more like a hedge
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of being like a big tall orange
tree style, they grew like a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking hedge.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where they find it out and then the
fucking, all in trellis, all in trellis
[SPEAKER_03]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was to fucking bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is, I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law enforcement, whatever from camp,
you'd run them on the ground and then
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking they'd grow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to protect for wind and shit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You fuck around and we catch windstorms
all throughout the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could take care of some shit,
baby at work, at work, at work,
[SPEAKER_03]: at work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, after all that
hard work, you catch one windstorm in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle of the night and you didn't put up
your support system or you didn't build a
[SPEAKER_03]: support system into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: New people go out there, do stupid shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Oh, I'll just go get some fucking
some two inch by two inch wooden stakes,
[SPEAKER_03]: pound those into the ground, tie my
trellis thing to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Hey, well the first time it rains and
the ground gets soft, that shit's coming
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your plants going in the fucking dirt and
welcome to mud town and all of your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's going to be pissing you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, yeah, you know, use proper
shit, get some 10 foot T posts and fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: build a build shit that can't fucking
fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I really appreciate you coming on
the show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been good catching up, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to catch up some more in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do a podcast from Thailand to
tell everybody about your experiences out
[SPEAKER_03]: there and you take you do on poolside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I'll call you from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not going out until November,
but I'll come pick you up at the airport,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's do a podcast from here to
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do it overseas and pick you up in a
limo, bro, with a fucking dab rig in the
[SPEAKER_03]: back, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, so tell us a little bit about
where everybody can find you now that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're back on the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're going to find us in Thailand
here in a couple of months because we got
[SPEAKER_03]: all the licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have the shop open and all of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, right now we're still keeping it
a little bit low key.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing our big launch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had our new logo because it's a
collaboration of teams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've all keep, we're all maintaining
our independence and keeping our,
[SPEAKER_03]: our brands that we've kind of built.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we have a collaborative brand
called cannabis continental and because
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all going to be all around the world
and we're made up of people from all
[SPEAKER_03]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah, we're going to, uh,
look forward, look for seeing that,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, you know, we've got a Instagram
cannabis continental page.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, go ahead and like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We ain't got no content on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, give me a couple of weeks and
I'll have some good shit for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk to you soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
