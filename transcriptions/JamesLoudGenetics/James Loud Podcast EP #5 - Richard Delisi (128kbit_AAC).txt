[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate what you've gone
through and other people like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess let's dive back right to the
beginning and tell me how you started
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started smoking pot when I was like 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a much bigger guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was I was a big 13 year old,
had mustache and all that stuff when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was, you know, with all the food and
generic stuff that they're feeding us
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had my my my brother in law had a 55
Chevy before he was my brother in law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were driving down Flapple Avenue in
Brooklyn, New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And his name was Buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddy said to me, hey, man, you want to
smoke some some some weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, yeah, the stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get high on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was sitting in the backseat with my
friend, Bobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was so crazy because I closed my
eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time I ever got off
smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I closed my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that they were closed for
like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I opened them, we were like
almost in the same spot, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we were going like 60 miles an hour
down Flapple Avenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the first time I smoked pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then not too not too long after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started selling pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was probably just turned 14 when I
started selling it because we were in
[SPEAKER_04]: front of the stores where I grew up,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: In a place called Breezy Point Rockaway
Point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this Jewish kid from the neighborhood
pulls up in a Pontiac Bonneville,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I see like all the kids run over to the
car.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said to my friend, my friend,
BT, Bob Torano, I said, hey, Bob,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's the deal with everybody running
over the car?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, oh, the guy's selling pot pot and
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, not in our parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not selling no hash and weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that ain't going on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took us like about a week and a
half.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the guy's connection and everything
down pat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the end of him coming in our
neighborhood anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we took it over and then.
[SPEAKER_04]: My family decided to move to Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they did, I was already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing my thing craziness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, yeah, man, I'll I'll help you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I helped the family move.
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped the family move.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wound up getting an apartment down
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized that it was like it was
like no matter what, thirteen hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: miles closer to Columbia, because that was
my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one one day, one afternoon,
me and my brother driving around,
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a little Porsche.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're driving around smoking pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulling to us to the 7-Eleven on Sample
Road in Pompano Beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're walking out of the 7-Eleven and
I see there's a car trader, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the car trader magazines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Order trader.
[SPEAKER_04]: Order trader.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see a little house and it says
Columbia House for Sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I grabbed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said to the guy, hey, man,
give me a roll of quarters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him a ten dollar bill when he gave
me a roll of quarters.
[SPEAKER_04]: I walk outside and I light up the J that
we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother says, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, we're going to call this guy up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This house is for sale in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother said, you fucking crazy or
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, we're going to buy this house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five days later.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even have passports when I said
that to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five days later, we were in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we did was we went to the we went to
the passport office with tickets already.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought the tickets without our
passports and we went to the passport
[SPEAKER_04]: office and I said, hey, listen,
one of one of my family members died in
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the tickets.
[SPEAKER_04]: My family gave me the tickets to go there,
but I don't have a passport.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, you got your birth certificate?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother handed them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said, come back in two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had our two hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had our passports.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little different these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it ever?
[SPEAKER_04]: I came home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to wait 26 days for my passport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of prices were, you know,
like if you want to put some weed or some
[SPEAKER_00]: hash on the streets back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in the 60s or 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: This in the in the 70s, the early 70s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'd bring like 30,000 once a
month, sometimes 60,000 once a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd maybe put 25,000 on a boat and send it
to New York or to send it to Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my my planes could hold 20,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would load up one of my DC,
my DC six is DC fours, DC threes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd load up a DC six with round trip gas
and I had a thousand gallon tank inside
[SPEAKER_04]: the cabin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd fly down, fill the plane up,
fly back to Florida, Polk County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Land on my friend's ranch, unload and send
it to New York and Chicago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were saying, oh, man,
you're so crazy for doing that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy for doing, you know, when I was in
the in the joint, they were saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: man, you've got some pair of balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, no, bro, you got the balls going
on 7-Eleven trying to rob him and then
[SPEAKER_04]: shoot somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got big balls, brass balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: This shit was like, you know, no big
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank God no one ever got hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought close to a million pounds of
weed into this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every pound of it was sent them out of
gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I spent a few years doing it before I
got caught up in, you know, the Florida
[SPEAKER_04]: the Florida syndrome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called, you know, like, in other
words, you hire Florida people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as something goes wrong there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking to the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what happened with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got I never actually got busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this time or the time before.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually ratted me out and they
indicted me both times.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about what
happened with that going to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you said 37 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did 32 calendars straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a little bit the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same type of deal, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think they were they were really
aggravated with me because what they did
[SPEAKER_04]: was they gave me the first time they gave
me five, five years sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seven five year sentences running
wild.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to knock a five year off every time
to get to the last five, the last five to
[SPEAKER_04]: seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like 35, 35.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so I knew it was an illegal sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said I said to my lawyer,
I said, hey, man, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, man, don't say a word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just let them process everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they processed everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sent us away to prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called my lawyer when I got there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a thing set up for you for a
rehearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave me five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to do three, three, six,
nine on a five.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had to I had done two years in the
county, so I only had to do like a year
[SPEAKER_04]: and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's when Rick came into the
picture, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what happened was that case,
that first case was I wasn't really in the
[SPEAKER_03]: picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was very young.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so you were a baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was about five.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he got out the first time,
I was about six years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my mom had kind of like kidnapped me
and brought me to Haiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were born in 1970, 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like basically the first case I
wasn't really involved in because my
[SPEAKER_03]: mother had taken me and kind of like ran
away with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when my pops got out,
I was I lived with him for I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, till till he was till he was
arrested again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back and forth with my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were so as far back as you can
remember, he was locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we met for about five years in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this this next this this two years
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about seven years until then he started
trying to get me out over 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually how I heard about you
originally, because we met in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, we hung out, went out to
dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you told me the story and you told me
your dad's going to be free one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: days sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting in I'm sitting in your your
place today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that something pretty amazing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got my own product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's the wildest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you have some really good
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of smuggling and other things like was
there anything that went wrong where you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys saved the day or you pulled out of
it, where you almost got hit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was times, you know,
when we were coming back with boats and we
[SPEAKER_04]: ran into like hurricanes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of boats you guys you guys
you guys use like speed boats?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used North Sea trolls and stuff,
you know, big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, big, big, big stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can put 30,000, 40,000
pounds inside of it and drive from
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia to New York nonstop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's how here's how nuts I was.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the beginning, I wanted to bring a
load into New York, right into where I
[SPEAKER_04]: grew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: People were saying, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hey, man, I want to bring a load
from Columbia to Brooklyn where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go right into the to the bay
where I what I used to swim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And me and my brother, my brother Ted,
he was my partner on a deal, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bought a sports fishing boat,
you know, just to track.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put all the radio equipment in there to
track the big boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a 60 footer, 65 foot,
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Maria or the.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had I had a I had a ship once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually almost 60,000 pounds just
before I got busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting ready to load 60,000 pounds
of tie stick on my tanker, which was
[SPEAKER_04]: called the Bantry Bay, which we took the
tanks that used to be fuel tanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We cleaned them all out and washed out the
tanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the weed was going.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were going to deliver that to
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had it all set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the boat never left Singapore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought it to Singapore to have some
work done to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we were going to Thailand with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it never got to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had all the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed was all sitting somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitting somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wound up, man, it was such a bad
deal not coming with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like 10,000, 15,000 pounds of booty
sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you remember them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the real the real fat ones like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: About that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other ones were regular ties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the bamboo wrapped around it
around the bamboo stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen them fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only seen them really old.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend pulled one out of a safe maybe
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business partner had one.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got them, they're back again now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Thailand's legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all that stuff's happening again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been to Thailand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I been there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not since.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only out two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no doubt in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going there with me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If his wife will let him go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If his wife will let him go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to come with.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, expanding internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're doing such and we did such
wonderful things this trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this thing is going to finally
start coming together where, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can at least move out of the hood where
I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in a wild neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other day, there was five shots at
like three o'clock in the morning in the
[SPEAKER_04]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: He found this.
[SPEAKER_04]: He found the shells that pop out of the
gun when you're shooting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is in my parking lot, where I live.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, yeah, I'm desensitized all
this shit because they got people shooting
[SPEAKER_00]: guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a little hood issue in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Oakland, you think Oakland's
the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like there's bad places.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a hood.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hood in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland's a little hood now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I got these I got these
little crazy things that happened to me in
[SPEAKER_04]: my life.

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to Jamaica to fill it up with
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, are you fucking out of your mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, man, we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the weed waiting down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, we'll bring it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, man, go shopping.
[SPEAKER_04]: Build a boat up with whatever you guys
want to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a partner to come with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I called my friend in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told my friend in New York,
I said, hey, man, I'm sending you a
[SPEAKER_04]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on the flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on the flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, we're going to go we're going to
go on a boat trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my friend came in from, you know,
he flew down, said, well, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, oh, we're going to get some weed
down in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my friend is like, for real,
you don't even so hopped up about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We wound up he wound up coming down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seen the boat, he was like, really
excited, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the way back on the way down,
I mean, like, you know what a dolphin is
[SPEAKER_04]: right in my mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I caught one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, Dorado, I'm almost six feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Its eyes were this big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They change color to catch them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was this wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Its head was that wide and it was that
tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you got to sit up on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're listening to the Grateful Dead in
the boombox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're smoking Jays, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the automatic pilot on,
which was a rope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was a rope hooked to the steering
wheel was our automatic pilot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had two hundred I had a hundred
fifty foot ski line out the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred foot and a hundred fifty foot,
a hundred and fifty foot ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dolphin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're sitting there smoking,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're like, you know,
the bread bag joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bread bag joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows little bread bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to put like four ounces in a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're sitting up there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see the ski line bouncing like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a skier on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bouncing along, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it goes, I'm looking out the side of
the boat and the thing is trying to pass
[SPEAKER_04]: the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a dolphin with a hook in its
mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a whale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hey, Bobby, check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I said that, this fucking
dolphin came out of the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell you, it danced on its tail like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For like 10, 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know about the colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all these colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ran across the steel top of the boat,
went down the steel ladder, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're pulling this fish in,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This fish ain't going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a hook in its mouth like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a hook like that in its mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what I was dragging was with a
feather with a fifteen hundred pound test
[SPEAKER_04]: wire leader hook to the ski line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ski line was twenty feet,
twenty five feet from the fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're pulling this thing in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell my I tell my partner,
Bobby, I said, Bobby, go get my bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a bat in the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pulling this thing in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bobby goes gets gloves because you've
got to pull the wire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bring this thing in and I I get the bat
and I'm beating this thing up and the
[SPEAKER_04]: blood is flying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the captain on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only like like a first mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bobby's like a first mate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're literally covered from head to
toe with blood from this fish bouncing
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beat its brains out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm covered in blood and I got the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I rinsed the bat off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I walk up the side of the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, hey, man, here's the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the captain of the boat looks at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thinks I my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thinks I beat my friend up with the
bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so he's like he's where's BT?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, BT is in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, tell him to come up here for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, he's trying to clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting ready, you know,
to clean off the deck and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he said, OK, because he thought I beat
him up with the bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the way back, we ran into this
crazy, crazy February storm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking 35.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 foot seas and we're in there with the
boat overloaded and da da da da.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a long story short, we wound up
losing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laying in the bunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're in these 30 foot seas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like the perfect storm type
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you see is up or down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm laying in the bunk and I got two
seatbelts across me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm laying in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend BT is in the top bunk and
the captain and the other guy are taking
[SPEAKER_04]: care of the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hear some kind of freaky noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I unclip my seatbelt, my seatbelt
that's holding me in the bunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my feet on the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water's up to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside the cabin, up to my knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way we're going to survive if
this boat sinks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this water coming over?
[SPEAKER_04]: It broke the two front windshields out of
the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: A wave came over the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we went down, went underneath
the wave.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it popped back up,
another wave hit it and knocked out both
[SPEAKER_04]: windows.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they were about this big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a we had to think real fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We turned the boat around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tore up the carpet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this marine plywood off the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had unbolted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is we're doing this in 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 foot siege.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then then I got to cut this stuff with
a jigsaw.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then someone's got to go outside with
a rope around them and put it up against
[SPEAKER_04]: the windows and drill holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to do all this in this terrible
storm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just said, God, get me home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get me home this one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll never do this again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make a long story short, I lied to God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't your last time.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't because I thought I was I
always thought it was a righteous thing I
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never felt that it was like an
unrighteous thing to smuggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was a few times when I was
down in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I was picking up like
30,000 pounds with the airplane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'd be some of the some of the,
you know, the the Colombians, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: goombas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd have like, I don't know,
fifteen hundred, two thousand pounds of
[SPEAKER_04]: cocaine there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they tell me, yeah, just take it to
America and and we'll give you X amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, man, I don't take that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mess that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shit kills people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, in my in my wildest dream,
you couldn't get me to do that if I was
[SPEAKER_04]: broke on my ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but he'd trade him and get a brick for
himself and go party.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I said, listen, I heard so many
stories of him partying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, listen, I'd say to him,
well, you know, I'll take one key.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, take one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, no, I want one key, you know,
for me and my guys when I get home and I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: buy a key off them and give them like two
thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I could have got it for
like eight hundred a key of coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so that was the Maria deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The windows get stowed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes us a bunch of hours to get
everything squared away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back on our on our course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got the pump going, getting the
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The boat is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, it didn't sink because they had a
sealed up engine room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get all the water pumped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go over this reef in the Bahamas and we
cut a hole through the reef to go into
[SPEAKER_04]: this little lagoon around the back of the
reef.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sat there for three days with the boat
going up and down eight, nine feet at a
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with the anchor out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost all food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inceptor had some fish in the freezer,
and that's what we survived on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the wildest part.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were leaving Jamaica, I had met
this roster guy down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was looking out for us on the heavy
duty Chinese smoke down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Chinese people down there
grow the best smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he made sure that I had the best smoke,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He had the dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for real, hanging off dead hair,
you know, like for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way down his back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I'm leaving, he's helping him
load the boat, but he comes back after we
[SPEAKER_04]: got all the weed on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says to me, he's waving to me and I
say, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, man, I just brought you some food
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He brought me pineapples, mangoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Guava?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guava.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of it was really ripe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had two holes in the back that had
propane tanks in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only had one propane tank aboard,
one of them big ones, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other hole was empty.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a tank in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I opened it up and I put that stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I closed it, the string that was
on it, you know, I tied off so it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: lay in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what fed us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in three or four days, that and the
fish that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we took the wooden windows down
and we drove right into Lighthouse Point
[SPEAKER_04]: with the boat, you know, like we were
fishing guys and we were coming home from
[SPEAKER_04]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the weed got wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed that was in the master bedroom
underneath the bed had got wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 300 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So after we're all done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what happened was during the deal,
the captain backed out of the deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted to get off the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, man, take the dinghy and go do
what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I ain't getting off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't getting in no Boston Weller.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's 30 foot seas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he said, will you take over this deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: So me and BT took over because when I got
on the boat, I said to Bobby, he's a
[SPEAKER_04]: master, a master carpenter, a master,
a master artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Bobby, you make sure before we
leave this fucking dock, if something
[SPEAKER_04]: happens to these two guys on the boat,
that you know how to get us home.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, oh, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: He fucking took out the.
[SPEAKER_04]: The maps and everything, you know,
the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looked at everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, yeah, man, I could do this in the
stars if I have to with the stars,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can come home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, you sure?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, yeah, no problem, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Tarrano is an amazing human.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get back, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We unload the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild deal coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to stop because it was low tide in
the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: The draft on the boat couldn't get into
the canal where we wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we parked on the intercoastal.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this time, my father and my brother
think that I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think the boat sunk in the ocean with
me and my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been watching the weather on the
news.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought we were lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing's on the news yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my father knows because my brother had
to tell him that what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he didn't show up on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't show on no calls, nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got to the dock.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went right up to the phone booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called my father's house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hey, Pop, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, have you heard anything from your
brother?
[SPEAKER_04]: He thinks he's talking to my brother,
Chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, no, I haven't heard from nobody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just calling you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, who is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, it's Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, where the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I'm down on the intercoastal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dad, go to Abbey Road and get me a couple
of steak dinners.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a couple of lobster dinners and bring
them down to the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, lobster dinner, steak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Dad, go get the fucking steak
dinners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't eaten in days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we fucking went and got all the stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's looking to go on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, you can go in the cabin of the
boat and you don't see nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You walk right inside the cabin and is but
the bathroom is loaded.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you don't want to take a
shit, you got to unload the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to shower, you got to unload
the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like 300 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That were wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end of the day, when I
distributed everything to where it was
[SPEAKER_04]: going, because I was in charge then,
it went from five grand that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: make a lot of money now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I got back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Ritzler,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was the guy that wanted to be in the
rat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not already.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is some super silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good small.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about some classic super silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from making me on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I rolled a smaller one than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown by flora and flame in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's good stuff, but it definitely
gets you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the yawns and it gets me to
wake back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens is I tell I tell this kid
Alan, I said, Alan, throw this shit in
[SPEAKER_04]: your van.
[SPEAKER_04]: And take it to the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up at up at Winn-Dixie and throw it in the
dumpster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the way home.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He puts it in his car and takes it to his
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, rents a warehouse the next
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this kid is going to make like a
hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is in 1970.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred grand is like two million.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I'm going to get my I'm
going to get my share.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get like me me and my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to wind up with 50 G's,
60 G's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he takes I I distributed all the weed
to people that I knew that I was dealing
[SPEAKER_04]: with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to wait like four or five days to
get the money because I fronted
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave all the weed out on the front on a
handshake.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I said in five days, I'm coming north
and as I go, I want to collect everything
[SPEAKER_04]: as I'm going to New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I collected all the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to New York when I got to New
York, I made a deal with somebody to take
[SPEAKER_04]: the remaining money that I owed the
Jamaicans down to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had to take care of all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This kid, you know, the captain and the
other guy was out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm in charge of all that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the Jamaicans like me much
more than them, because I went back there
[SPEAKER_04]: many times and they were like always with
their arms like this amazing country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's amazing country.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's really getting.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend, Steve D'Angelo, has a resort
down there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the weed is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the funny thing is there's bad,
really bad weed there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the good stuff, the Orange Hill,
Lamb's Bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get over there by the grill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Lamb's Bread who grows up in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's one dude or a group
that grow over there by the grill.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the weed went from like decent to
outrageous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Chinese people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real land raised shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't wasn't much of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like even Lamb's Bread is like
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even seen it in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never actually seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some hybrids of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely know the fucking musky turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were getting flour in Jamaica,
do you remember the strains of the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strains or was it just a good
weed or no, it was just it was either the
[SPEAKER_04]: Chinese people had it or the Jamaicans had
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you did Chinese?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grew superb weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any of the Chinese smoke that you got was
just like this stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the stuff we used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to come back to one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just the reason why you got busted the
first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I'm going to come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we like we like the American people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a lot of money to buy that in
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed was wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the weed was wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he took it to a well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, I'm doing my thing to get him
the rest of his money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what's going on with the
I didn't know he had the weed in a
[SPEAKER_04]: warehouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I start making my moves and I'm going
to New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to New York, buy a van
customized and go to California by a
[SPEAKER_04]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're making our move going and I get
to New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: I buy a Ford van, like a two year old van,
and my friend's a master carpenter.
[SPEAKER_04]: He tricks it out inside TV, you know,
the whole deal bonkers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really tricked out nice lights and
everything back there.
And.
[SPEAKER_04]: We drive with he buys a common gear while
we're in Florida off my off my family,
[SPEAKER_04]: a brand like almost a brand or common
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're going to both drive out to
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got my friend Joe in the truck with me
or my friend Bobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be four of us in two
cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We drive out to the coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of stuff happened on our
way out there like.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stopped in Vegas and I had like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think I blew like four
twenty.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Eighteen thousand, I blew in the casino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went up to get another five
thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend that was with me said,
don't touch that money, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby will fucking choke you in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: She fucking give me that money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking took the money, went back down,
went like thirty five, forty thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bobby never even found out about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get to California and we I'm going
in on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're buying a house right on the right on
the Pacific coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a stair.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's electric thing that goes down to the
beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you know about that place
in said by the San Diego.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the steps or the surface surf
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're buying a second house from the
steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I call home, my father says to me,
hey, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the front page of the Sun
Sentinel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should get a fucking life, Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: The man, you got to come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marshals were here twice today looking for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, you know, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your boy, your boy got caught with some
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, who got caught with weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: He says Ritzema.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had some weed in a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was drying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people, the carpenters that had
the warehouse next to it couldn't stand
[SPEAKER_04]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they called the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, you got to come home right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, fuck, I'm getting ready to
buy this thing with my friends,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to come home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the first bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to two trials on that federal and I
beat both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beat both trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I was found innocent of all
charges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second time they indicted me
for perjuring myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted me to wrap my friend out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put my friend into my friend,
John.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bring him into the into the
courtroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say, you see John Pegg around
anywhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the guy that was on the boat
with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, no, he ain't in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, I was sitting right there at the,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Said, he ain't in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Said, well, what do you look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had gave two different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that when I told them the
first time, you know what the guys look
[SPEAKER_04]: like on the boat when they were asking me,
I said, I don't know these guys names.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only know what they look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I was I was a prisoner on the boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get off the boat till it hit
Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ritzema said when that boat touched
the dock that I got off it and I never
[SPEAKER_04]: went back on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what he told them in court.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's what actually freed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And them two guys that ratted Ritzema and
his friend, they're the guys that did the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: After trying to burn us.
[SPEAKER_04]: After trying to burn you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how that one ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was two after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that oil, Ray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's crazy how like that's
all just a bail getting wet, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and all from the smell, because you're
trying to, you know, everybody making a
[SPEAKER_03]: group decision like, yeah, we're going to
get rid of that because it's it's trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want people smoking salt water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We and then the dude being like,
no, let me go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to drop it off and let me go
put it in a storage space and then try to
[SPEAKER_03]: dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the best part of the whole deal
was I paid him in full.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had someone when I got to
Melbourne.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend, Dick Latree, I don't know if
you ever heard of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like a very famous surfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He owned the surf shops in Cocoa,
but he was a famous, famous surfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like twenty five hundred pounds to
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had the cash for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, hey, listen, man, I can't go
back to South Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, he's in Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, man, can you bring this down to
Pompano and give it to this guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, who's the guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, he's my partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, this fucking jerk off was
getting ready to rat me out and I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: even know it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he goes down and pays him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call Britson, you know, from a phone
booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man, I got paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But meanwhile, he's got this fucking weed
in the warehouse, trying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go up, get my van, my friend
customizes the inside and we're driving
[SPEAKER_04]: out to California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it lost the money and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to California and I call my father.
[SPEAKER_04]: He tells me, yeah, man, you're on the
front page of the Sun Sentinel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you know, I thought he was fucking
kidding me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But meanwhile, I was on the in the front
page for one month straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Miami Herald and the Sun Sentinel and
Fort Lauderdale a month straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a story on me every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they arrested me, they are an odd
me to my father.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know, not a not a cash bond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when when I was in California,
I said, to my father, I ain't fucking come
[SPEAKER_04]: back to Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, fuck this house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go to Mexico and, you know,
start something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess I'm going for Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my father talked me out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that that was the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate to say it like that,
and it sounds very one part of it sounds
[SPEAKER_04]: very selfish.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but but so here's my look at my
outlook on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my opinion is that if it wasn't for
people that push the envelope like
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, there would be none of this
around today like it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be in some different form,
but it would probably still be illegal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there would be a small
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really the people that push the
envelope that made the difference for
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because it made it want the demand to
understand it also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a product and people start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there had to be a supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was it was so wild for me
when I was a kid because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: believe I'd buy a pound and I'd nickel it
up into nickel bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, a shot glass was a nickel bag back
when I was growing up and the brown
[SPEAKER_04]: envelopes, you know, you fold them in
half, you know, the stuffed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was thing was this fat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So five hundred of them in one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: For five dollars each.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're a kid then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was a kid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's late 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's before I even started smuggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I buy a pound, nickel it up,
maybe make a couple ounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had one of my special guys that I had
wanted a quarter of a pound, I'd get a
[SPEAKER_04]: pound and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what they cost back then for a
pound a pound?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like twenty four bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty four bucks a pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which had to buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to buy like 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know where I bought them from?
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought them from Mitch's the Goomba.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to in the hospital the other
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stevie Gallo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the Gallo brothers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: From New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stevie Gallo, the gangsters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they love me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd go in and I'd say, hey, give me give
me 30 pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cash them right out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking young little motherfucker
driving a brand new Corvette.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a brand new Corvette, a Palkalong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was 1966.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1967.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did the vet go for then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both years I had brand new Corvettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nine thousand dollars, something like
that for anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven thousand, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty eight hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty eight hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forty eight hundred for like a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now at two hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a nice four twenty seven,
sixty seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a spotless one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going for two hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two hundred grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matter of fact, his buddy, which is a
sheik, is trying to get one right now
[SPEAKER_04]: because of what I told him about the cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're only going to appreciate
those cars are just going to keep going up
[SPEAKER_00]: in value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only I I me and my brother were
tripping one day in my car and we went
[SPEAKER_04]: into Manhattan and we went to we went to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what the name of the club was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was in the East Village.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, we got trashed on acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're tripping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my brother says, are you going to be OK
to drive?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, yeah, man, what are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go through the Brooklyn Battery
Tunnel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going one hundred and thirty
miles an hour from the Brooklyn Battery
[SPEAKER_04]: Tunnel on acid with side pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what side pipes are?
[SPEAKER_00]: The side pipes on the vet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what it sounds like when you're
going that fast in the tunnel?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not my acid wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get through the tunnel and I go through
the tollbooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go through the tollbooth like 80 miles
an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, because I knew it was they
were going to be they were going to come
[SPEAKER_04]: after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did was instead of staying on
the parkway, I made the left and went on
[SPEAKER_04]: our ocean parkway off the belt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got away from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we get halfway home.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother says, where's my jacket?
[SPEAKER_04]: My wallet's in my jacket.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to go back to Manhattan,
but we couldn't go.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't go in the same path.
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't go through the battery.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to go to Brooklyn Bridge,
go over the Brooklyn Bridge and go far
[SPEAKER_04]: downtown, you know, to the village and
make and get everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of acid, so you have you used
to be our probably are still a big fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you knew Mickey Hart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mickey Hart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, me and Mickey were tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to I'm trying to get with him
while I'm out here right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one he made me what?
[SPEAKER_04]: A thousand T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the T-shirts ever got made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they got made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was I know there was like
five hundred of them in boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He made these special T-shirts for my
release.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was part of a yeah, part of a but he
was part of a deal with someone else and
[SPEAKER_04]: they did something and he said he couldn't

[SPEAKER_00]: Let him know I'm out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did you listen to music wise
back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those were some of the best years
for music, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so it was so it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that everything went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From when I started when I when I started
hanging with the dead, I met so many rock
[SPEAKER_04]: people, you know, Gracie Slick,
Janis Joplin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm Jimi Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to smoke joints with Jimi Hendrix
in Steve Paul scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to go downstairs and see Paul
scene and man and smoke joints together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about smoking a joint with
Jimi Hendrix, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wherever the dude went, I was welcome
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I met Sam Santana there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I met so many people there and I used
to hang around in this place called on
[SPEAKER_04]: Dean's.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you ever hear of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was like the club on the right next
to the 59th Street Bridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like this little club.
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend, my friend was a doorman or I
could have never, ever, ever got into
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this little teeny club, but it's
really swanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the people that are in the music
business, you know, like this jockeys like
[SPEAKER_04]: Marty Kay, you know, one of them guys from
New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all go there and they have a little
teeny stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I met Jim Morrison in the
doors and I met Cher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they just my friend said,
yes, this guy, this guy's coming from
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Morrison, he's supposed to be a wild
guy, right?
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, he wound up being a wild guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've had a I've had a I've had a
pretty crazy life, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's starting to settle down,
you know, kind of settle on down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this whole thing that's going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure I'm a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go down to history part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's no, no, I don't want to be
a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're definitely I need to I need to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like the people that are
still here, you know, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: each other like, hey, we got this,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been tough in the industry,
whether you're doing cultivation or
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics or anything like that,
there's more competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of bullshit products on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's definitely a place for
high end boutique products and authentic
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you launched your brand in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it in Florida originally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I launched my brand in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kim Rivers is a wonderful woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That whatever she tells you, well,
whatever she told me, she did.
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no like little curve,
you know, OK, we said we were going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: this, but we can't do that now because
something can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever she told me she was going to do,
she did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she said it's going to take this long
to start building your deal because when
[SPEAKER_04]: when me and Richie went to pick out the
generics, genetics, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weeds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we went to pick out the stuff,
right, they only had a small amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: what we wanted, but that's what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to wait a while for them to get
it going, you know, get the mothers going
[SPEAKER_04]: and the babies and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's trucking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went up there the other day and it's a
first class, first class operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that all came about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, my cousin had gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my cousin, Kenny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he the one I met in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Ken?
[SPEAKER_03]: Darby.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's simply radio and Kenny Darby.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he basically went to go meet Redman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they went to Redman invited us to a
party in this mansion in Miami.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an event where Redman had arranged
a party and my cousin went there and met
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kim Rivers was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just basically asked my cousin to
start, you know, trying to help me out
[SPEAKER_03]: with my dad and the whole situation,
because in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just it was like almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unreal to have my father back in my life
and then to figure out how because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: based in Amsterdam, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to figure out how to like get
back around him to make something happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my cousin has been that conduit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, he he basically stepped to Kim
Rivers at that party when she walked by
[SPEAKER_03]: and kind of like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got her name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you said he goes, he goes,
Hey, Kim.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she looked over at him, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm standing right next to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says to me, Oh, I'd like you to
meet my Uncle Richard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You looked at me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said, I know who your Uncle Richard
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I reached out and shook her hand when
I shook her hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not lying to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you shake someone's hands
and you click with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was there was a click there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew she was for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I and we had said it.
But.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can it said to a.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, however, you can help us out.
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes, Oh, you know, I can't mess with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys would burn her.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, well, not with Berner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be stepping to you if I was
with Berner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, I want to do something with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said pre-rolls for starters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we got we got pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got live rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to have going to say
shortly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just truly from Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, out here on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking to hook up with people like
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you guys are doing and
how many dispensaries are you guys in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's one hundred and twenty
four shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one hundred twenty three in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's more is like I think
there's thirty in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but twenty in Maryland or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Florida is the only place for
operating twenty one and one hundred and
[SPEAKER_04]: twenty one in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to eighty five of them already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I go there and, you know,
meet the people, take pictures with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I send it to Tallahassee.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my stuff does not stay on the
shelf in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I set all new records for Trulieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it doesn't last more than two
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that it's changed, as soon as it
runs out, they fill it back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my my feeling on a wreck and one of the
problems with all this wrecked cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: is that a lot of it's not fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get fresh products, a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it moves, if the companies are moving
their product, but if you're getting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even six, eight weeks after
harvest, sometimes some of these brands,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower tastes like shit, even though
the genetics were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been grown correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think that's what the flowers
were hitting at what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty eight or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the pre rolls were twenty three,
twenty four, nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he I love the pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he gets on me because I buy them
when I go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he charged me like five bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I buy pre rolls from
dispensaries just so I could try out the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the stuff they have,
they have pretty good free rolls,
[SPEAKER_00]: free rolls, free rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got pretty good ones out there now in
Washington and California and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're doing a pretty good job
with quality of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's you know, I think the
market's a lot more stable in like
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That market's really stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, they went through their
second recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's interesting up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work up there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre rolls as well, because, you know,
you can give a person like a more,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, valuable product from their
aspect, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think of the pre rolls
that are infused with either diamonds or
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, hash holes?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it works, people, if there's a market
for it, I, you know, I support it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of the hash holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a niche market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes a lot of sense, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the some of the infused stuff can
be kind of nasty to tacky, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it to be like some sort of quality
kept to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the stuff that I see is like
weird Keefe and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I have tasted a lot of good
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just a shout out to CGO Lifestyle is
just smoking his pre rolls and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: insane, like crazy donuts, just crazy
flavors and rosin that really pairs well
[SPEAKER_03]: with the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a big market for like good
pre rolls also, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you roll good, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find pre rolls that are on
that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy that was on the show a while
back, the professional joint roller at
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy rolls amazing bombers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I learned how to roll from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I learned a new way to roll from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's this guy yesterday we met.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to his class cost a thousand
bucks to learn how to roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was joking when he said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he was joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was done yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy rolled the chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to have one of my jacket.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got one of my jacket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's wild how you can roll now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, these new tips like did you roll
on those tips or you bought that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got them from from dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so you got organic tips.com or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I roll my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's like he's got a piece of wood
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like wood, not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's got a tip in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just put the filter inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just put your filter inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's why it's like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a trick to fold in the filter to go
in and out and make it look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big on paper tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to like glass for a minute,
but I really think the weight of glass is
[SPEAKER_03]: annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the paper tastes good if you
use good tips like those OG raw tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: you use those to make a crutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using the the piece of dude,
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy, professional driver,
he does that and he takes like the sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: part and cuts it off and then uses that to
wrap around and hold the tip together.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see all the different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing we've got to not forget,
you know, I mean, you know, everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: making money out here with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know about everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a there's a there's a good
crew making money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a good group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so many people that are still
inside for nonviolent marijuana charges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I mean, there's 40,000 right
in us, right in the states without the
[SPEAKER_04]: feds, just in the states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they gave what they get the kid in
Louisiana or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three lives for a quarter of a pound or
something lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was something crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, still happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so crazy because I feel like most
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you got you got you got you got
organizations like Glass Prisoners
[SPEAKER_04]: Project, Freedom Grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are trying to get people out
of prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care about nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even care about making any
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They care about just getting people home
to their folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where they can spend time with
their children or their mother and their
[SPEAKER_04]: father.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was I got, you know,
32 years that I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost my mom, my dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost a couple of children.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's and I can't I can't go back and say
to somebody, well, you had me locked up
[SPEAKER_04]: for something that's legal now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want get back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Florida, they entrapped me into the
deal, but they don't have entrapment law
[SPEAKER_04]: in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it would happen to New York,
I would have been found innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a cop can't set you up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, you know, people being this guy,
this guy, Jim White and Shelley White.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They own this place called the Naked Lady
Ranch.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he was one of my pilots.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wound up setting me up, put me away on
his last deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last deal was with planes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last day was a plane deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to go into that and,
you know, that that whole experience
[SPEAKER_00]: before you got in trouble and kind of what
you were doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him I don't want to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, just get me the money home.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had when I when I was in prison,
he stole one of my executive aircrafts and
[SPEAKER_04]: crashed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason the guy was breathing and
talking to me on the telephone that day is
[SPEAKER_04]: because my cousin climbed back up into the
wreckage of the plane, unhooked his
[SPEAKER_04]: seatbelt and dropped this guy out of the
plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he dropped him, the guy when he
dropped him out of the plane, it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: because they were on top of banana roaches
when the plane crashed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it came apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wings, you know, it all deal with weed all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: That side of the plane got bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: This side got ripped off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my cousin got a cut on his knee.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He unhooked and dropped out of the plane
because he thought it was going to go up
[SPEAKER_04]: in flames.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He felt the guy for pulse.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy had no pulse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he dropped down and he crawled away and
threw up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was he was semi in shock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's laying up against a tree
waiting for the Jamaicans to come to get
[SPEAKER_04]: them to get him right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he sees the guy lift his head up in
the plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, holy shit, I got to go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes back and climbs up, gets him,
pulls him out, drops and the guy drops.
[SPEAKER_04]: If he was a ball on the ground like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: All his bones are broken in his body.
[SPEAKER_04]: His legs, his back, his hip.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's falling so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, from the from the plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: When my cousin pulled him out,
he was he was when he when he was holding
[SPEAKER_04]: him, he was like seven feet long.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy's only like five something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like seven feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when he dropped him, he wasn't he
was this high on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Compound fractures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this guy is the guy that set me up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My cousin saved his life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: For money, for money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you doing it, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_04]: It blows me away, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It blows me away, you know, to see a guy
fucking get caught doing something,
[SPEAKER_04]: snitching out something that from way
back, you know, it's just I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: I see so many people fall for things that
they did 10 years ago because they did it
[SPEAKER_04]: with somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, I did this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got one dollar on a weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put in like 35 keys of coke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the kingpin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just worked for him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they go get the guy years later
in Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they get away with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They put the guy away for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida had a lot of smuggling going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're so corrupt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they all want in on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now all the all the congress members up
there in Tallahassee, they're all trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to get their hands on stores and farms,
and they all want to grow weed now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the shit that they gave me 98 years
for, they want to grow now and make money
[SPEAKER_04]: off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think of the California
scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We might even get a place in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive, but it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city's nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'll keep a place in Florida
because I really like Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice when it's nice here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, we've been driving for two days
in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was nice when you guys landed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we made a beautiful landing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought beautiful sunshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we ran into good sunshine again.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather's usually always super nice
when I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always love San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we only have a week of this and it's
gonna be nice for three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we had really, really strange
year with weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had so much rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the most rain I've ever seen in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: More rain than ever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: More rain than ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was seeing it on the news every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked really kind of it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the news makes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was coming to California for two
months.
[SPEAKER_04]: He kept telling me, yeah, I'm going to
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I call him up two days later.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, what's going on with the California
trip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still raining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was flooding, you know,
so it was like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like a good time to come,
you know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we're here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're off to Hawaii after this.

[SPEAKER_04]: with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got somebody with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your favorite food in New York?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my all time favorite food in New
York is, of course, Italian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Chinese in New York, the Chinese
food.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, since I was a kid involved with the
Grateful Dead, we used to go to dead
[SPEAKER_04]: concerts in the Fillmore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I go knock on the back door.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd open up the door and say,
who's ever with Rallo?
[SPEAKER_04]: They call me Rallo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's ever with Rallo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was 20 people standing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, come on, you know, people that,
you know, hippies and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, come on in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, most of the time, the 20 people that
were there came right from my neighborhood
[SPEAKER_04]: with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, we all drove together and
Volkswagen Vans and Volkswagen Bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we all had.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had an outstanding child,
you know, when I was growing up as a child
[SPEAKER_04]: and growing up as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different world back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even us growing up, you know,
being born in 77, it was a different world
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the phone age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phone age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have cell phones when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had pagers when I was like in high
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, later, later.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't like a smartphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a belt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to wear what they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they call the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You used to tell me they used to call them
the what?
[SPEAKER_04]: The block.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brick phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: The brick phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big old brick phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can remember the first time I got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took it to California with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was drag racing professionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm standing on a stop line in Pomona
and the fucking phone rings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you got to be fucking kidding
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it rang on my side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vibrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my wife calling me from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you got to be fucking kidding
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came out now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what they give me when I come out
of the prison after 32 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you used to it yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the dopamine every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to imagine that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like dealing with sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned something else in it with this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Video calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: With people.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the movies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was in the movies in the 70s
and 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we used to get like a little phone
in there, you know, inside the joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we had a flip phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a little burner phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could send a picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could flush it down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was a little thing like this
big.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it closed, it was like that big.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could flush it right down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never catch you with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where were you incarcerated?
[SPEAKER_04]: All over Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in like 10 different prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: In bed, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in Fed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They leave you somewhere and they think
you're getting a little comfortable there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they see it when the wardens and stuff
see that you're getting along with all the
[SPEAKER_04]: officers real good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know that something's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we got the officers bringing in
whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, I didn't I didn't want
for much in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I I I was liked and I helped so
many people in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: My thing was, when I got off the bus,
do whatever it is to keep this brain
[SPEAKER_04]: occupied, because this shit here will have
me hanging inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hang myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I can't go with that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife's fucking around out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I just had her all that right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here I am talking to you.
It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's been an amazing journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the next five years, where do you
guys see your company and where do you see
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I see the cannabis industry
going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think everybody's kind of like
sitting on the edge of their seats,
[SPEAKER_03]: wondering if this is going to go federal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legal, not that that's like encompassing
how everything's going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of people are trying to
structure their next moves around that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that cannabis, because it's
it's so niche, it's a special plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a Marlboro cigarette,
it's not like a cigarette where you could
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, OK, that cigarette just tastes
like that every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like it's it has to do with like
people really loving new terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: new ways that the plant makes them feel or
makes them heal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's there's different ways
that people use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people use it recreationally and some
some people use it to heal themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Dennis Perrone said, yeah,
whether what is it, whether you believe it
[SPEAKER_00]: or not, it's it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think whether you know it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and my cousin have tripped so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much often because we always smoked so
much tree and we were always like,
[SPEAKER_03]: why do we smoke so much fucking tree?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we love it so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had a very traumatic youth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a way that I know and almost
guarantee that that's how I deal with my
[SPEAKER_03]: PTSD, you know, like not having a parent
growing up or watching the perils of how,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, his hit, what what he went
through, made our family go through not
[SPEAKER_03]: even to do as cannabis, just like family
shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the cannabis will always have its
there'll be a very commercial wave,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will just keep happening as
each state conforms to how it deals with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because each state has a
different approach to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like and I think that over time,
just like good cannabis will always hold
[SPEAKER_03]: its weight, you know, like certain people
want really good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be a demand on a
sort of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think and extracts, I think extra for
sure, because it's always breaking through
[SPEAKER_03]: to like a new level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're always coming out with
new different forms of extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really like at the end of the day,
good flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love like all the full melts,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But flour is definitely like a key.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis component, you know,
better than I kind of feel like you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: just smoke one or the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to like indulge in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like variety and I like smoking sativas
and I like smoking strong indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like I'm a mix, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have like if it is the indica
or sativa, because it's all pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like I like floral turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like floral turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, candy, gas, gas, candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Curves, gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like old chems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like old OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like them when they punch you in
the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they punch you in the nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think classical OG is like staple
cannabis for anybody's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that super silver was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely got me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first hit I took, I felt like
right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked so much of it in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your type?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any particular strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys sell some strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to talk about the strains
you guys sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got flamingo kush on the market in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is like an indica hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indica dominant hybrid, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a it's a very, very strong
cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like an OG?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a cross of it's a kush
mitzvino.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it's I think they pop something
like 25 different different seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they we chose 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, the way Florida goes,
you have to rename things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So becomes a whole like with the
Department of Health, you have to give it
[SPEAKER_03]: a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to explain that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not even familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just know that we had to choose a
name and it had to be approved by the
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the first name was not
approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it came back to us on the second
round.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were doing going with an
alligator gated thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they didn't approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably because of college and all that
stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what state has the best weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: In your opinion, I mean, me, I say
California hands down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, some there's some things
growing, I'm sure, in little I'm sure
[SPEAKER_03]: there's like little small bad shit going
in all types of states where there's just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every every state has a guy showed me
something today that he grew in his spare
[SPEAKER_04]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he showed me the whole setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, here's my bedroom showed me a
light system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I mean, that's you know,
and he's looking to give me some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like fucking bro, you're making a little
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess he's got the bedroom and he's got
his wife and kids and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the rest of the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, fuck, you only got that little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't need none.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was very pretty, pretty purple and
red with the orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember purple weed back in the
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was there a bunch of purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yeah, there was some purple around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone in and out of favor for the
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what it was?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can remember seeing some weed in the
80s, late 70s that the bottom of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the top of the leaf was green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or reddish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it would start to bud,
it'd be like the purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, embedded in it, the crystal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the little bit of red and the
orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then Columbia, was that was that
where your favorite flower came from?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite flower, Colombian
gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone, we met someone today that might
know someone that has some Colombian
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some Colombian hybrid seeds that I
would like to give you.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can pop those and hopefully
find something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and they're the biggest seeds I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like my seeds and my gold were
giant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like little peas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild how big they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like three times bigger than
some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the birds love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: The birds and my bird feeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this has been a wonderful deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really appreciate you guys coming
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I love being able to tell
stories for the world to fricking hear,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like some of these people
like yourself, you know, you guys aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to be able to tell you from
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to come back and do this
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years from now, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should get your own podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would be a great host.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with the Zoom style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could always start with just a Zoom
style from your laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think, yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got good stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a lot of people I'm
sure you can reconnect with and for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like before when you were
breaking down, how did the business come
[SPEAKER_03]: about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wanted to break down to you how
like probably the first time I ever had
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned what what I what what I thought
could be for my father was probably,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say eight or nine years ago,
maybe 10 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were on a phone call and, you know,
shit was just starting to become
[SPEAKER_03]: transparent that it was legal legalizing
everywhere and kind of normalizing in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way in people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yo, he was like,
you know, is it like he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of tripping like, are people really
making money off this shit every day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this really happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, it's really
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you're going to get out,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember saying to him at that
point, you know, we I'll carve a lane out
[SPEAKER_03]: for you and we'll make sure that,
you know, there's there's a restitution
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of put forth for you so we can make
sure you get something back for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: sacrifice you've gone through,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's probably how this all came
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people say it's this or
that or but everything starts with kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like an idea, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really remember like tripping even
like after meeting you and seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: spannabus and seeing the whole evolution
of the cannabis industry, it just blew me
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew that it was actually going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I started saying it to people
like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, I was almost confident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you were caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been knocked down again after I'd
said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To you, I was broken and he was broken
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like motions denied and all
types of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, thanks to here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
