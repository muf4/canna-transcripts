[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today my special guest is my good
friend, Nicky T.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling blessed, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go way back, but let's, let's talk
about long hair, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess when we first met, we both had
long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had long, long hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had dreadlocks down to my ankles,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you coined the term solvent list,
which I disagreed with back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like solvent list.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were one of the guys disagreeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, but you know,
I feel like the, the interesting thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with language is over time, when you have
something that makes sense, if enough
[SPEAKER_01]: people use it, you can change language.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be a specific way,
especially if there's purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's pretty much what you
did, which is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from that, from looking back now
I'm like, well, he had a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were definitely a lot of naysayers,
a lot of scientists that came at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water's the universal solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, in general, there was a
lot of hate with coining a new term and
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a product that people really
hadn't seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty cool to see where it's
come today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the evolution, you know,
you're, you're a pioneer as far as extract
[SPEAKER_01]: and you took it from, you know,
there, there was just regular bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing really good bubble hash,
but then I met you maybe around 2010,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you took it up a notch to where it
was, it was a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bubble hash, but it was like
another level of bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That in its of itself created the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the point of, or the reason I
coined the term solvent list, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: started bringing product to the shelves
that I was working with and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, here's my bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, no, bubble hash is
what we already have on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours doesn't look like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours doesn't smell like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't consuming it the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't call it bubble hash really,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were doing things a little bit
differently than what Mark or bubble man
[SPEAKER_02]: was promoting, how he was processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to kind of create initially a
term that separated us from the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it caught on and a lot of people
started using that term and real quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: after wanting to hoard that term for just
separation, I realized that I needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: teach people what we were doing in order
to really sell the product that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: selling because people didn't understand
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing so, everyone wanted to jump
on that solvent list train.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's a trip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you completely changed the
landscape for rosin and all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you paved the way for rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a step back and talk about,
cause we're both from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally from Oregon, but I grew up
in the Bay area and you grew up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California originally,
but let's talk about cannabis in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California and how you got your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being raised in Northern
California meant that cannabis was very
[SPEAKER_02]: prevalent in my upbringing and very
accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a blessed situation where my family
was very accepting of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had people in my family that used to be
drivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had people in my family used to be
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still farmers actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I grew up in a place that cannabis
was extremely accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I started selling weed,
it wasn't something that my family was
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked about by any means, but it wasn't
something that they were going to get mad
[SPEAKER_02]: at me for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was what it felt like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like what I was doing was fairly
accepted by my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really allowed me to excel in the
cannabis space from an early age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before regulation, I was definitely
selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came to a point where I was bringing in
some money and some weed into like the
[SPEAKER_02]: family house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, this doesn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually moved out kind of early on
and started going to junior college
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of high school early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also opened up more avenues to
sell more cannabis is going to a junior
[SPEAKER_02]: high school or junior college when I was
13 years old.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essential extracts started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it originally start in Colorado or was
it started in Colorado 2012?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was operating in California and I was
DJing and doing some promotion promotional
[SPEAKER_02]: work for true school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started something here in Oakland,
actually, and had some attention,
[SPEAKER_02]: some unwanted attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were told that California wasn't
ready for what I was doing, basically go
[SPEAKER_02]: back to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado was one of the first places that
really allowed us to operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt a lot safer than 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sold weed my entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had just recently had a kid and I
wanted to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came back to Colorado and we started
essential extracts actually in 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: By 2010, it was a licensed entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is in some ways is a lot I talk
about on my show about being a more mature
[SPEAKER_01]: market than California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like they trust their brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not personally, you know,
as far as cultivation, like indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it's, it's tough out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington is the polar opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got California, which is like
the perfect weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that perfect is really
according to what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stems back to historically terroir
and hash regions weren't in near the
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorial, but the flower cultivation
regions were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for me, Colorado is like
that dry, cold climate that's perfect for
[SPEAKER_02]: making hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might not be the best for,
you know, producing flour or drying and
[SPEAKER_02]: curing flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as hash production,
it's one of the best places to make hash
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you get your start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now a lot of kids they have
YouTube and they have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's tons of resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's endless, you know, and there's so
many extract artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get your start?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you work with Mila a little bit at
a certain point, but really the start came
[SPEAKER_02]: from having a family that was accepting of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my start was as a teenager,
selling weed in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, I always wanted it to be on
the up and up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wanted to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got robbed as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, had some issues with the law
as a kid and I was tired of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to be forefront about what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was actually one of the first
people to reach out to the DOR and to
[SPEAKER_02]: reach out to them and being like,
Hey, I want to pay taxes on hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to play around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's really where the
start happened for the regulated community
[SPEAKER_02]: is essential extracts was one of the very
first licensed hash making companies in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there we had one of the first
labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had companies from all over the world
from micro fluid X who was in the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: brew coffee industry to other tech
technology industries, brewing industries
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to us being like, Hey, we want to
bring our equipment into your lab because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a big, you know,
reason that we came up early is we had one
[SPEAKER_02]: of those first licensed protected
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where big, bigger brands felt comfortable
bringing a quarter million dollar piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment into that lab rather than in the
homies basement or your garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is solventless for those people that
don't know what is solventless?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, so initially the very first
term that was coined back in like 2010 and
[SPEAKER_02]: with the help of Paul token, who was one
of, I think one of the first influencers,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the first YouTube influencers,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were hanging out and I was constantly
trying to evolve the technology we were
[SPEAKER_02]: producing to mimic what we were seeing in
the hydrocarbon world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when honey oil first came to the
market, butane hash oil, um, we,
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it in reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made it when it first came to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a honey bee extractor in the back
of high times and I was making it on my
[SPEAKER_02]: back porch in Boulder, Colorado,
but there was a lot of unknowns and I
[SPEAKER_02]: loved the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved the consistency, but I didn't
know what I was giving to my friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: what I was selling my people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to Amsterdam and I looked into
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first and only cafes that was
willing to share some COAs with me was the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue bird cafe back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they were also one of the first
cafes to have a milk alternative for my
[SPEAKER_02]: lactose intolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I liked the blue bird, but they were
able to share some things with me that
[SPEAKER_02]: showed me that there was other ISO butane,
ISO pentane and other residuals left
[SPEAKER_02]: behind in that butane hash or one of the
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously there's, there were a lot of
different people making it back then,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it scared me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of came back to the United
States with this idea that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: create something that looked and tasted
and, and was consumed like that butane
[SPEAKER_02]: hash oil, but without the use of any
chemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, the product consistency
of ear wax and that term was really
[SPEAKER_02]: popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first term that, you know,
Paul and I really coined was solventless
[SPEAKER_02]: wax, but then we realized different
consistencies were coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from solvent or from,
you know, more of a batter like
[SPEAKER_02]: consistency, the shatter like
consistencies more, you know, more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: viscosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized, and then we started
recreating with more heat or less heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: those different consistencies utilizing
water hash and started calling things
[SPEAKER_02]: solventless shatter and solventless
batter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then solventless really became the
overhead umbrella term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all happened really, really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say within like a six month period,
we started talking about solventless wax,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then very quickly it became an
umbrella term for anything that we created
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanically without the use of any
chemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the answer to your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially you asked, what is solventless?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mechanically separated dry comb
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: More recently, you've even worked with
developing cultivars specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, probably for a long time,
but I've known about it from recently with
[SPEAKER_01]: my book, you actually help you with the
stuff on selecting washers, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would say I developed cultivars,
but definitely have developed a method of
[SPEAKER_02]: tactile sensation to fine washers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I'm down to talk about it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been washing and really it
wasn't until 2012 that we started keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: track of that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012 is when we started keeping track of
yield data and we started looking at all
[SPEAKER_02]: the cultivars at pink house, the facility
that I was working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started noticing that some of these
cultivars were yielding way less and some
[SPEAKER_02]: of them were yielding way more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, that's really when my eyes opened
up like, okay, maybe we shouldn't wash
[SPEAKER_02]: this blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should send that to hydrocarbon
in reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was seeing like sub 0.05% on this
blue dream cut that we are still yielding
[SPEAKER_02]: two and a half pounds per light back in
the day metric, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still selling for really high
numbers in flower form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why was I taking all these fresh frozen
or, or even dry pounds back then and
[SPEAKER_02]: processing them if I was going to see,
you know, a minimal yield and that minimal
[SPEAKER_02]: yield was never the highest quality when
it was yielding that low, when you're like
[SPEAKER_02]: sub 1%, it's never the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I shouldn't say never.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some outliers always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, looking at those numbers,
we realized that not everything is
[SPEAKER_02]: allocated or should be allocated to
solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that that's where things
changed for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started to hone in on those bigger
washers that also still had the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: representation or, you know, the volatile
compound representation that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: after.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then it's funny how far that's
come too, as far as washers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry bananas has always been known
as a good washer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all these, the banana conda and
the banana Oreos, these ones that test 6%,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6% plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the highest test you've seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, highest test on paper that I saw
personally was the gorilla princess.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was inside the field extracts lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Field extracts was a company that,
um, I collaborated with for their launch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won a few cups together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and in that time we were processing a
few different things from all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed friends and, uh, field Z brought
over some gorilla princess and it hit like
[SPEAKER_02]: over 9%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and it ended up not being something I
put my name on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause we were collaborating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were finding certain things that I
like could really stand behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it was a huge yielder,
but it didn't have a terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get like above 6%, I feel like
the terpenes get a little subdued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like same thing when you're
above 30, 40% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes those aren't like the super
terpy strains that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, you know, sometimes you find a
super tasty strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also 35 plus, but I'm not looking
for high THC in reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could go back and take all that
stuff away and be like, does it taste
[SPEAKER_01]: good?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you can answer those two
things, that's all you really need to know
[SPEAKER_01]: that the THC and it's great, but it's such
a, you know, it's, it's such a confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Piece of information that they think that,
cause it's high THC that it's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them more high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really trying to dispel that myth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you work with the Gange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys, you guys are out there full
force trying to dispel lots of myths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, the industry is still
brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just started researching the plant
not too long ago on an empirical level,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will, protected level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the, the program is constantly
evolving and that's what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the professional platform that I was
looking for as a teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, a constantly evolving
platform, you know, or constantly evolving
[SPEAKER_02]: education, just as our industry is
constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are one of the most busiest guys I
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us a little bit more about the
Gange and how that started and how you got
[SPEAKER_01]: involved with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shot a little TV series in Southern
California at the green flower media
[SPEAKER_02]: studio with Derek Gilman.
[SPEAKER_02]: The show was called high rollers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I pulled up at the studio,
they have like a makeup person and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, proper lighting and a real studio
setups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, okay, this is what I've
been looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, I've done some teaching for a
lot of the other platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to name right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've grown up teaching from swim
instruction to surf instruction to
[SPEAKER_02]: snowboard instruction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was looking for a professional
platform and after shooting high rollers
[SPEAKER_02]: with Derek, I thought that green flower
could be that professional platform very
[SPEAKER_02]: soon after it all kind of happened at the
right time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was looking for that platform and
very soon after high rollers they brought
[SPEAKER_02]: another project that they wanted to
involve me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also involved, I believe it was
16 or 20 other, maybe more other council
[SPEAKER_02]: members in this project at the very onset
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even believe it had a name very
soon after.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the onset, the term gone GA became
the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Jodri brought that name to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a name that was previously given to
Kevin, but we utilized it for the
[SPEAKER_02]: platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of council members.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another reason that I wanted to
work with the platform because it had
[SPEAKER_02]: peers and mentors of mine that I looked up
to that I agree with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in a lot of the aspects of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was excited to be among people that
I, like to be around and that I respected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, all of that kind of came together
and we started gone GA program maybe four
[SPEAKER_02]: or five years ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe, I think we're in our third
year of active, um, on or in person
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the gone GA is do a, uh, a period where
they're doing a bunch of online studies
[SPEAKER_02]: and that period could be any number of
time, depending on how long it takes you
[SPEAKER_02]: to get through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the online goes through everything
from cultivation to processing,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the law, to retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It covers a big chunk of our industry as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, then after they've finished,
or sometimes they don't have to finish the
[SPEAKER_02]: online portion, but whether when they're
confident with the online portion,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can sign up for in-person training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, of course they have to finish,
you know, the online and the in-person
[SPEAKER_02]: training to get certified, but the
in-person training consists of two days
[SPEAKER_02]: where the first day we do some
assessments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we actually assess some local Southern
Humboldt cultivated flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally it's full sun, but we also bring
in some other living soil grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, some living soil indoor grows as well
for assessment purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we assess utilizing the systematic
assessment protocol app, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: application that we've developed and are
constantly evolving as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: To, uh, assess the flower because we felt
like that was a big need in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to talk about what is quality in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of myths out there as far as
what is quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do an assessment and then we also do
a farm tour where we bring the students to
[SPEAKER_02]: a local, uh, Southern Humboldt farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they let, they, they get to
feel the magic at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once they come up to the farm,
I don't really need to do too much
[SPEAKER_02]: talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love bringing people on the farm
because especially people from out of
[SPEAKER_02]: state or people that haven't seen live
cannabis plants, it's a, it's a treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an eye-opening experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I saw a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember the first
time you saw a plant, but first time,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember growing a few in the backyard
as a little kid, but yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't believe, I mean, I,
I seen bud for a while before I saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and the first time I saw a plant,
I was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what, that's what it is that
we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's like, uh, all these
things are becoming lost arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people that are out
there that have never actually seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growing just like they've never seen
the vegetables growing that they're eating
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're buying from the grocery
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in a strange world where there's
this big disconnect from how, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: education can solve a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but also experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to provide both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm constantly learning each and every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what keeps me motivated to teach in
reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why this emerging market is so
perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm still motivated after 20
something years of doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but thank you to the plant for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're in a, we're in a really
strange time in the industry, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely, you know, we're in this,
especially in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: like this consolidation phase again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are people that are suffering
and people that are having tough times,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we are in the infancy of an industry
that'll be, you know, a hundred years from
[SPEAKER_01]: now is going to be a very stable industry
and a very different industry in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ways, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even 10 years from now, we should be a
little more stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, right now, you know, what's your
thought on all the new genetics that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a top forties list.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like every three months,
there's something new, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an OG guy though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, OG is like a classic hit that'll
be around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one, regardless of how you
feel about blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a, or anybody that's
watching, it's a staple that'll always be
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's starting to come back now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to come back now for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been, uh, it's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, geez, we're gone for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, not in your world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in my world ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, like I actually ran out of my
little living soil tent recently just in
[SPEAKER_02]: the last couple of days here and I reached
out to somebody and that's actually what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking is some, somebody else's
living soil, OG Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm super blessed to have found this
guy because normally I just smoke my weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and I haven't run out of my weed in a long
time, but, um, I've been on tour and some
[SPEAKER_02]: things got a little sidetracked in the
garden and had to do a little reset,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, now we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just was a, you know, it was a quick
couple of months reset that we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: flowered for, but I smoked up all my
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those couple of months.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's something special we said
about growing your own flower and smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: your own flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know exactly what was put into it and
what you put into it is what you get out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially effect wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you love about the living
soil the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what I love about my personal living
soil is I know all the amendments and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that goes into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know everything that is being brewed
as a tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still do hit it with some teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but all of my teas are made by my good
friend, rich and base organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where his farm is, you know,
like it's all very close to home and like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something about riches nutrients
that I just, it gives me this certain,
[SPEAKER_02]: even just getting them in raw form.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this smell when I get them all,
you know, um, his veg and his bloom,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just this homely smell about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I tasted other people's living
soil or K and F gardens, oftentimes I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: tasting like a fruit ferment or I'm
tasting something else that's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our living soil blend that we've
been, you know, constantly tweaking over
[SPEAKER_02]: the years, there's just for me anyways,
because it's, it's something I've gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no outliers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tasting really truly what that
phenotypical expression wants me to taste
[SPEAKER_02]: is how I feel about my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not getting any of that extra molasses
or any of that extra fruit juice or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in an organic sense, there are things
that can be done in a living soil garden
[SPEAKER_02]: that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then of course on the salt side,
there's things as well, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I don't want to taste the line
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to taste, you know,
that extra carb boost that you pumped it
[SPEAKER_02]: and the end to give it that bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to taste that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the full expression of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be a little bit different for
each person because now my pallets train
[SPEAKER_02]: to this, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and this is rare that I find somebody
else's living soil garden that I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: really happy with that I want to smoke
and, or actually somebody's garden in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the living soil,
somebody's salt grow or whatever it may
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every once in a while I find like
somebody's, you know, salt grow that I
[SPEAKER_02]: actually really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Whoa, what, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're running that nutrient brand,
but it tastes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's rad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's guys that really can pull it off
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, living soil, uh, how big of scale have
you seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: People successfully pull it off at the
where it's stuff that you would enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, um, one of the first people
that really built out a lot of the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil grows in Colorado was this
woman named Cassandra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and she started at this dispensary
called Eminem dispensary, Mike and Mike
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started following around from there
because we started getting product from
[SPEAKER_02]: them, dry material that was washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was something happening in this
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know at the time it was living
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what the method was of their
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew that Eminem was giving me the
fire and we ended up winning a cup with
[SPEAKER_02]: some of their material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw that that same cultivator
went over to places like Verde.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I was like, okay, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had partnered with Verde kind of
around that same time, uh, pink house and
[SPEAKER_02]: Verde created a little bond, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we shared some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and Chuck's still a really,
really good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started noticing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started noticing this trend of where,
you know, this girl went and built out
[SPEAKER_02]: these big living soil beds that I liked
that flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, big up Cassandra.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a woman that has really set the
stage for living soil cultivations in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a people, not a lot of people know
about her and know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and know that that's why that product
was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then I've also seen, um,
our buddies over at moon valley cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in the North Bay and they have,
it's still not a large facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's five to 7,500, maybe 10,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but beautiful large living soil beds
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it is scalable on in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'd say that those are some of the
bigger ones though, that I've seen our 10
[SPEAKER_02]: K 10,000 square foot living soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's bigger out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just never been to Wrigley in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil, my friend, Laura flame,
Chris castle, uh, they're in Oakland and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing double stack two tier living
soil beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hearing a lot more about flora
and flame recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to try this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys, I'm going to show you this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a strawberry banana skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this stuff that's, oh, we just pop or
maybe we're about to pop these seeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: These, uh, um, it's not strawberry banana,
but it's something banana and skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA's got some new stuff coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just on the show not too long
ago that they're doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good guys.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this is living soil indoor living
soil indoor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blown out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got nice banana chirps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's mild on the banana,
but I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super skittly, but it's candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it smokes the, it translates in
the smoke, which is what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not everything translates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff you smell purple punch,
for an example, smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of purple pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreos is something very bland to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreos, the original Oreos cut looks
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag appeal banging super easy to grow,
but I do not want to, it's got,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely got a look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you couldn't smell it, you'd think
it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: White truffles is another one I'm not
really fond of personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked that Crohn's cut of white
truffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it has this like petrichor to it
that like speaks to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this like sandalwood eucalyptus
petrichor thing that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like similar to biscotti.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely prefer the biscotti turps
cause it's like that same earthy petrichor
[SPEAKER_02]: gas eucalyptus, but the biscotti also has
the cream and the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes until you try the right cut,
you might think something sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I haven't, I'm one of those
people that I've seen that happen so many
[SPEAKER_01]: times in my life where I'm like,
Oh, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone shows me the good version
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, Oh shit, this is,
this is what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A wedding cake was the best example of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd seen so many Finos out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over 30, I think there's over 30 Finos
of wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd seen a bunch that I was just in
Thailand and they're calling stuff wedding
[SPEAKER_02]: crashers and wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so far from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I tasted some lemon tree that
was called wedding crashers in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the first time I saw a good
wedding cake, I'd probably seen like 10
[SPEAKER_01]: other Finos of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, and then it wasn't the
biggest yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the cakiest, but it had the most
flavor and smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was bready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You burn down the Roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Roach tasted good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a, that's a big test for me is
like, how does it taste of the Roach?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I refire it, how does it taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just getting all this rain right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was kind of talking to my buddy
before I popped in here that this was
[SPEAKER_02]: burning like super white in Colorado,
the same weed, but now that it's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity and I was just out in the rain,
basically burning a little darker too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these guys are flushing with
magnesium now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're adding magnesium to the flush that
burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trick they're using to burn more
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it increases the temperature at
which it combusts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it burns more fully, which creates more
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be more flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white, what's your thought on white
ash?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like even ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it doesn't have to be white.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely, there's reasons
that white ash, I want my, my weed to
[SPEAKER_02]: fully combust.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want there to be any carbon
leftover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when cannabis fully combusts,
it's generally going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: lighter in color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, it's a combination of the
water content and the combustion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that combustion is attributed to what
micronutrients are left behind and what,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what else is left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of variables to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely impressed every time I see
all white ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it looks like a cigarette or a
cigar, but a lot of that has to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect cure too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've had all white ash where it just
tastes so bland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care that it burns that clean if
it tastes like the paper I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting some stuff from grass
valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this year that like it had the
blackest of ash, but it tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to keep smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it burns, even in that darker
colored ash is actually fully combusting
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not leaving a lot of that super
hard carbon behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's leaving a lot of carbon
behind, generally, even if it tastes good,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just recently tried some, um,
some more freeze dried flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had freeze dried flour in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but this, this new batch, um,
of freeze dried flour, it looked amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I went to burn it, it wasn't like
the, the, the color of the ash was
[SPEAKER_02]: bothering me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the, it wasn't satisfying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a light feeling that I wasn't
getting the full smoke satisfaction that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The freeze dry weed trips me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal has been pushing it for
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys, I wanted to come on the
show and I want to do a side by side
[SPEAKER_01]: because they claim it's, you know,
higher terpenes, higher cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and you know, it looks weird though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like astronaut ice cream,
but with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can get some of those,
if you remove a hundred percent of the
[SPEAKER_02]: water, you know, but I think it's also
going to be a balance of not wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: remove a hundred percent of the water and
finding like a middle ground, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and somebody out there watching is
going to fine tune it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to give me some weed at
spandibus or one of these events that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to, I think cash tree masons,
freeze dried flour is some of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze dried flour I've had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had freeze dried flour that smokes
proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have yet to try some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, things that are good, but that
are, yeah, you should try some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, you should try, uh, you should
try some of the, some of cash is freeze
[SPEAKER_02]: dried flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought it was actually good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I've had, you know, some that is
not as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the concept is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, I think the
concept is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like freeze dryers and you know,
well, and to be able to control it,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can control it down to,
uh, you know, below a percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 10th of a percent and you can control
them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your moisture and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the science is there that,
you know, I, it's hard to argue with
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have yet to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I do, I'll, I'll be a big
proponent of it, but until I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be like, well, the stuff Ed
gave me at his house wasn't really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some variables to the freeze
drying process in, in all aspects in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash world for us and in freeze drying
flour, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2014, we did a dab a do with Dougie
and Mila, uh, San Francisco, We need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: another one next year, but let's talk
about Dabidu a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got involved with me and Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when did you start hanging out with
Mila?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe I first met Mila in early 2000s,
2004, probably at the latest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like I had gone previous to
that trip in 2004, but the most memorable
[SPEAKER_02]: trip for me was 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got a washing machine from Mila,
we actually put one of these big,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was like a Swedish or a press
from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like these big hand presses and
they were 100% stainless.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were tons of knockoffs in the United
States at the time, but they were all
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use one of those aluminum
knockoffs you bought at the head shop,
[SPEAKER_02]: they look really fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came in a nice velvet box and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after the first or second time,
you'd start shaving aluminum into your
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So real soon after we saw these knockoffs
come to the States, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need the real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mila was selling these real presses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put it inside of a washing machine I
bought from Mila.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up shipping it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it landed, the washing machine was
busted because the press was so heavy it
[SPEAKER_02]: busted out the plexiglass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up fixing it with some boat epoxy
and I still have that washing machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that same year is when I bought
those papaya seeds from Mila that have
[SPEAKER_02]: made a huge wave in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: That papaya has gone everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really cool to see people latch
onto that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big XJXJ for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that year is when I got those
seeds from Mila via Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I started hanging out with
Milas in those early 2000s days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I first traveled to Amsterdam and I was
told that I need to find Mila Jansen,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hash queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, okay, I was a hash guy
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people are like, you need to meet
this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to meet this woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And multiple people told me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go down the path of trying to find
these mammoth tusk crutches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used these crutches in my spliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found these mammoth tusks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big up Petey and the mammoth tusk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on in life, I found out who actually
was making these and became friends with
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a point where I was trying
to track down as many of them as I could
[SPEAKER_02]: find.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an extinct animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a rare item.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted these mammoth tusk crutches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard that Mila had a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really kind of what brought me
initially to Mila's warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where my eyes opened up to a whole
wall of hash from around the world that
[SPEAKER_02]: her fans had made her with using her
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got like this wall with like
letters and Ziploc bags and like little
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces of hash taped on the wall and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up just picking Mila's brain,
those trips, because there wasn't a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: about hashish and how to make it written
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were forums popping up and people
were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there really wasn't a lot of books
about hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had to kind of go study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mila was one of those people that I
wanted to study under.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would go to her shop, her warehouse,
where she would sell the pollinator and
[SPEAKER_02]: the bags and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just basically sit down with
her and bug her and ask her question after
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was out smoking me and still does
to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I remember her smoking like five
spliffs to every one of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, trying to keep up and like
coughing up a lung.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's this, this woman that was a
little older than me is just chiefin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's just rolling up one after
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's very patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was patient with me then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now still to this day, Mila's
traveling just as much as me, if not more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought I was like, I did a lot of
road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mila's crushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking love that woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's, uh, she's, she's super
rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't find people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, she's been so impactful to so
many of our lives, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many of us that she's touched
and, you know, really, really made a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, much love Mila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stayed at my house with, uh,
when she was here for the awards,
[SPEAKER_01]: she got the lifetime achievement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she stayed with us for a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went out on the Bay in a sailboat and
almost died.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that crazy story.
[SPEAKER_01]: She tells the story good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the captain was drunk and the
winds kicked up and you know how in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bay, when the winds kick up, it's like,
it was like being on the ocean.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to get back and we went
into a boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collided with another boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were fine, but it was pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we were all smoking weed and
then we got the guys drinking and it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been blessed to get out on the Bay on
calm days and bring in some halibut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work on a fishing boat a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go out to the Fairlawn islands
and go out in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so many different types
of fish and cool stuff to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so let's talk about you being a
DJ because that's, I mean, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got five different things you're,
you're doing right now that are all in
[SPEAKER_02]: this day and age, you've got to do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like for me anyways, to survive,
I can't just judge an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hard for the organizers to
pay me just to judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm oftentimes wanting to couple my
DJing or, you know, having a console on
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground, wherever I'm traveling,
set up or a class or hosting an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to do a lot, but yeah,
DJing 2013 Marlon Asher opening up for Big
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike and LP in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: You DJed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got really, I took dabs on stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually, I think that was the first
time I had performed with Marlon and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was no preparation and, and I was a
little nervous because like, this is an
[SPEAKER_02]: artist who I've looked up to and I played
his seven inch records for probably 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years before that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, it was a trip to get Marlon's,
you know, TV tracks or to get his tracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent to me and for me to plug them up and
just perform them without even listening
[SPEAKER_02]: to them in front of 3000 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had a good time afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still like, Hey, did I do okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, bro, we crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good event for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those old high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, there's an interesting group
of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, not interesting, but a good,
good group of people that started,
[SPEAKER_01]: they went to all the high times events.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were one of them, Alfred, you know,
and there was so many Al from Norcal
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, there's so many, there's so
many, and then there was some that would
[SPEAKER_01]: go to sign, but, but like, and then
spandibus was always a big one and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we were following high
times around for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to bring it to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out to Jamaica with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little bit of drama on the
ground there, I guess, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been back to Jamaica since.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one of the ones I missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to speak, which was a trip,
you know, being, you know, just being a
[SPEAKER_02]: white person in Jamaica, speaking on an
educational level to Jamaicans who have
[SPEAKER_02]: been farming for, you know, generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was hard for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, cause I'm like, I kind of
wanted those guys to be on the stage with
[SPEAKER_02]: me in reality, but I had Muda Baruka in
the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically Muda is the, the voice of the
people in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for him to be in the crowd,
and I remember him standing up and asking
[SPEAKER_02]: me a question and like, it was a pretty
direct, straightforward, militant style
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I answered it and I answered it,
you know, to the best of my ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember him like, you know,
saying, all right, respect and having
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, from somebody who's the
voice of the people to Jamaica was a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were definitely some highlights
to that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think on that same trip,
or maybe even a similar year, I was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hang out in Bob's house and do a
little interview with Muda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marlin's been on a couple episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Marlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's such a good, happy, positive energy
person in our life.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he's got his, his Marlin's choice
is like his California brand that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so we got some genetics
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing his thing, still playing his
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a new album coming out and it's
been coming out since earlier this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he's just a good person.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's down in, he's down by Monterey,
not by Monterey, but it's by Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his wife down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of DJing and the reggae music,
I started as a reggae music DJ and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: spinning seven inch records, 45 straight
from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I spun for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would travel around with like tackle
boxes and film cases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever I could find that would fit 45s
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would travel around doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got to a point where it was a lot
of records, even though there were smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: records, it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd say once I finally converted to
digital and started playing with Serato,
[SPEAKER_02]: I started broadening my music selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started with roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started with reggae and roots reggae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it got into dance hall, a little
slackness and some nineties, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: bashment, if you will, which is,
you know, a form of, a little bit more up
[SPEAKER_02]: pace reggae music from Jamaica,
but a little bit more rude and raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd say that things really
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was almost 10 years ago now when
it was Mila's 70th birthday party that I
[SPEAKER_02]: DJed in Amsterdam and she wanted me to
play 60s rock music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wanted, you know, she gave me a
list of artists and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, some of these artists I really get
down with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, I went back to the drawing
board and I was like, now that I have this
[SPEAKER_02]: digital availability to me, I'm going to
make some remixes or find remixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called up all my producer friends and
I got a bunch of remixes of like more rock
[SPEAKER_02]: style music, but like reggae style or a
little bit of some house remixes for the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the night and just kind of switched
it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was still able to perform the songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I even played some dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wanted dead, you know, to be
performed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played everything, all a bunch of
genres for Mila and people were getting
[SPEAKER_02]: down and I had like dead heads that were
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a full pack crowd at the milk wag
still dead heads being like, yo,
[SPEAKER_02]: that recording of that, that show that you
played up there, like that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, so I feel like I hit a bunch of
different people that were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, nicotine is not just a reggae DJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got some of that respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now being a DJ that's really
focused on these cannabis events,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just played in Vegas a couple of
nights ago and I played everything from
[SPEAKER_02]: 90s hip hop to Alma Piano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afro beats, Afro house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some funk and some soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I play a little of everything now
and I really have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just saw Steve Aoki and I was pretty
impressed actually with his performance in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he kind of goes all over the board
with stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really animated and he's really full
of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I need to see a bigger
performance like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly working on my DJ stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel like my library is almost
there, but it's, it's never there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got gigs and gigs and I'm constantly
digging for more stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just keeps evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my boy DJ theory just sent me a
remix pack this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like excited to get home and pull it
out, check it out, see what he sent me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so, and then you've been spending a
lot of time in South America too lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got married.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met your wife at Spanavis this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met her at, in Spain as well,
probably seven, eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, I mean, we haven't, we weren't
dating back then, but it was, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was cool that I met her in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's big into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: She smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is an amazing hash maker, an amazing
educator.
[SPEAKER_02]: She probably smokes a lot more than me
too, just like Mila, the women in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The women that smoke really smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife is, yeah, she's a boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was on mushrooms when I,
when I bumped into you guys, I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I surprised myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at strain hunters club and it's
dark there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, yeah, you dropped me some
fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was smoking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to James loud out in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was definitely, there's some good
weed out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some of my friends are going
really fucking amazing weed in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, everywhere though, Mexico,
my friends in Mexico are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, uh, just in Thailand
where I was at, I smoked really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really proper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when they're growing it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't smoke any import while I was in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that was my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to smoke what I can already
smoke at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I got to tour some amazing
facilities out there and, uh, smoke a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of really good local stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not have been labeled writer,
but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see any good land race stuff in
Thailand?
[SPEAKER_02]: They call things land race that I don't
think was land race.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not personally, I know that exists,
but I think that, you know, even,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You travel all around the world and like,
you get people saying, Hey, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: land race and I smell things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that came from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like back in the day, you might've had
it for a long, long time, but no,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smelling turpentine in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white widow, but yeah, that turpentine
limonene or turpentine limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's, it's all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: With stuff, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some you'll, you might even get that
from crossing stuff that doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there, you know?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So F four all of a sudden we have some
random occurrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think that came from?
[SPEAKER_02]: That turpentine?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the, I mean, it came from a
Colombian too, but like you also get it in
[SPEAKER_01]: African genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some in there,
but like the Colombian, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely dominant with the Colombian
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like naturally when you're in
those extreme environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that, like those desert-like
environments that turpentine really helps
[SPEAKER_02]: protect the plant almost protective
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, uh, I got some PIF
and some Cuban black and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's subtle in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, it's not like some of the
hazes that punch you in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was the difference between
the PIF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, I actually liked the PIFs
that I've seen because it had way less if
[SPEAKER_02]: none, none at all of the turpentine side
of, you know, those uplifting,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, if you will, for me,
like a Jamaican land race and PIF is very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, I like it because it's uplifting
without turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpentine gives me anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any of that spice, any of that too much
of it'll give me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the limonene, but turpentine,
anything with the citrus and the spice to
[SPEAKER_02]: me just gives me a little bit too racy in
my own head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm blessed these days to really only
smoke what I want to smoke these days and
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know how it affects me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that racy feeling sometimes where
you're like, am I going to be okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some strains that have like,
you know, similar terpene representations
[SPEAKER_02]: as like a PIF or a land race Jamaican
that, that don't have that turpentine and
[SPEAKER_02]: those still make me racy, but I would
prefer that style of racy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tinge of turpentine for some reason,
just sends me over the edge thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's making me a little anxious,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start talking about it and you're
like, part beat goes up about 10 beats per
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like lamb's bread and you know,
a Jamaican Jamaican genetics are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure the genetic layout has
changed quite a bit with all the moves
[SPEAKER_01]: towards legalization that's happened down
there and guys coming from Canada and the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of those old Jamaican varieties
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hard to find the true ones because
Jamaicans love to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but even like Sonny Chiba Shane,
he's got, he's got a lamb's bread cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a dead ringer for that musky
lamb bread, lamb's bread turd.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica is a fun place for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always bring it back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cause like for me, that Jamaican
land race is like what I want if it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like it's got a little bit
more depth to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these like very stringy land races
that just, you know, are almost unsmokable
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you're like picking each individual
bract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four inch bracts in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can roll it up in that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's pretty cool though.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different varieties from all
over, you know, how they're contributing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I guess it can go back to about
six different varieties for what we have
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States, pretty much six
different regions contributed to all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics that we're smoking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I, you know, I like land race
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious about land race stuff more
than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if it tastes harsh or it's not
grown correctly, I'm still curious about
[SPEAKER_01]: these flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I feel like diversity is the
ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've, we've inbred this stuff so
much that we have problems like hoplite
[SPEAKER_01]: and Veroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we have weak plants,
we have weak genetics compared to what we
[SPEAKER_01]: could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And genetic diversity is the key,
but it's like the right kind of genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity that people will appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think Durban's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of Durban and stuff
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started really collecting a lot of
those old school genetics and like housed
[SPEAKER_02]: them again, you know, from the UK cheese
that we just kind of got recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good old Zini.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've kept all these OGs and recently
my best friend and breeder who's also
[SPEAKER_02]: kept, I'd say 75% of these OGs for us as a
family over the last couple of decades
[SPEAKER_02]: here, he just recently moved to the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before he moved, I wanted to make sure
I grabbed like all of the other little
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that we hadn't had in just under our
roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like I've gotten back most of
the things that I really wanted to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got the ghost OG, I've got the
SFV, the triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me samples of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those samples you gave me,
you gave me some blueberry as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the blueberry is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got this tinge of spice, not a
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spice, but like a little bit of a,
almost like a blue dream spice to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the DJ short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was given to me as the 1992 or the
92 blueberry Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was given to me by bike,
uh, get seeds here or get seeds right
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good friend of mine who I've worked with
for years and years and years,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and just been, you know, friends with,
uh, for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just keeps petting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Passing me interesting cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yo, you just need to grow this
out and then like, let me know what you
[SPEAKER_02]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at first I was hoping that it was like
this original blueberry that we used to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow back in like the late nineties,
early two thousands in Boulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, was it a sativa?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but we had a sativa from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this was way more like big,
super fat leaf, huge colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if what we were growing back
in Boulder, Colorado was DJ shorts
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it was, it was blueberry smelling
and just huge colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were also growing it aeroponically and
it was a shorter plant with wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think DJ's was pretty, his is a shorter
plant, wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's changed over the years because
he's done so many generations too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that original blueberry is what I
thought bike was giving me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we flowered it out, I was like,
Oh no, this is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not mad at it because that
original blueberry never really made good
[SPEAKER_02]: water hash for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that bike gave me hits 4%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, for me, that one, like I've kept
it now as like a washer instead of what it
[SPEAKER_02]: was supposed to be and what I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: These big, big colas and the weight isn't
bad on her, on her either on the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: side, but she washes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the blue essence carries through,
but it's like this spicy blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly what I'm looking for,
but it's something cool to have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OGs man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we just got this creepy cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it's like a sativa OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That reminds me of something we're seeing
like down in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it has that pine cone bud shape
where the buds are like pine cones,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad nodes basing, sativa leaves very,
you know, wants to flop over needs
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, man, it's gassier than gas,
but it's not really, I mean, it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: OG gas, but it's like how OG for me,
it's like how OG gas was back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I haven't seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your favorite new genetic that's
popping off new, you know, in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, I like the direction of like the RS
11 and some of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I still do like smoking candy flavor
things, even though I'm an OG head and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what I need for like the high side
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some of these new flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I really do enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like, yeah, rainbow shirt,
brunts, all of the crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow a rainbow shirt, one of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow the 54, the 17 or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this cross that was given to me by
this guy, OG flaring.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really didn't know the original origins
just to break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he gave me an idea of what was in the
garden and what he thinks pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of came to conclusions in
reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we really don't know what's in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I call it RS 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's candy for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it definitely has a similar,
you know, profile as those rainbow sherbs
[SPEAKER_02]: and things in that world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this trend going on right now
and I don't know if you see it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: called snowballs or snowcaps or a buff
down weed where they coat it with THCA
[SPEAKER_01]: powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying that it's like,
it smells fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it looks like a flocked Christmas
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the oversaturation is really
like tanked the flower price all around
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people are doing all kinds of weird
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also why I'm just smoking my own
flower right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't sell flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really buy flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first thing I've bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like when you grow it
correctly, yeah, that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need, you just need the plant,
you know, and for me, I like the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like extract too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like rosin hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like micro dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want terpy, rosin dabs for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I still enjoy a spliff and just the
art of growing, you know, of rolling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I also like all the new technology
in the dab world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually what's made me more of
a dabber is doing the cleaning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: slurper and using the Q-tip and then put
it in the alcohol and all the little
[SPEAKER_02]: things to keep it, you know, free from
cross contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and keeping your shit fresh and
looking clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like that about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I like my, you know, new little
heady rigs set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my control tower from task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that anybody who's trying to
do innovation, I think is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy with, uh, the, in a lot of ways
I'm happy with the way the industry is
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately there's a consolidation
phase where the guys that have middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the road weed or they're getting you're
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you need to move on to something else
or grow better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at the end of the day, hopefully
that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still seeing a lot of like pretty weed
that doesn't taste that good so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of uninformed,
uneducated buyers still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be that type of weed
that's still going to run amok.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to educate against having that
in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, to me it's like pretend to kind and,
and I don't even know if like there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are like out there talking of
shit about everyone else's weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: calling everyone else's weed is mids
because their weed looks amazing in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that to me, that weed, that bag appeal
weed that looks amazing, but doesn't smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: right or doesn't taste right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the mids to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so for me, I think the future and what
I want to push is pre rolls and quality
[SPEAKER_01]: pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't ever get to see the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to cause it, how does it
make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as those two things are running
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but you have to have a brand that
people trust because if they see the
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of this stuff and it's all
scraggly online, they probably won't want
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, who cares what it
looks like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cat piss was the best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the ugliest weed I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also the most expensive and the
best taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles is not pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not easy to grow, not big yielding,
but I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's one of those ones that like,
I keep going back to Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have Skittles at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of different cuts of
Skittles now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ones that are, I think even
better than the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as crosses though, I don't know
that there's a better cross with Skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: in it than Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moonbow is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really interesting ones,
but as far as better work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if better is a good adjective
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this like pink Zugar that we're
growing right now that I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Skittles times straw guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a little bit more of a, like a round
creamy nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has less of the citrus that Skittles
tends to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it has a little bit more of a
punch than like the original Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm been leaning towards smoking
that when I like need to smoke because it
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a little bit extra though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love a Skittles, you know,
when I'm not like trying to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's, I'm not saying that in a
disc, but like when I'm just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: taste that flavor, that's the flavor I
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nothing that compares,
but when I need a little bit of extra
[SPEAKER_02]: something to get me through that day or
whatever it may be, the situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, some of the crosses have been viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles gets you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't break through the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you smoke, it's a flavor thing
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like Zootopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this new kids Zootopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who read it, but it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super terpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of crosses out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge Moonbow fan too though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fletcher's crushed it with his crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm smoking right now that
what I just finished was not Moonbow,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a faceoff OG times Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, we were just talking about that
last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need Fletcher to answer the actual
question because I, I'll speculate for
[SPEAKER_01]: days, but yeah, there's, there's some good
crosses out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I'm excited to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait till it goes back towards gas
and sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't keep my OGs now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also why I don't have any right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I finally started talking,
you know, and was like, Hey, I actually do
[SPEAKER_02]: have all these things still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and people were like, wait,
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people pulled up on me and I
don't have any more fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your stuff is clean and it's still
gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I wanted to share it with everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh wait, like, yeah,
no, I actually have the ghost here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got this try it please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't have anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite OG out of all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the classic ghost is like the
original OG with Josh D ghost is all the
[SPEAKER_01]: same cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, I think a lot of the cuts that
are named certain things are probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: same, but this ghost compared to the SFV
that I have just has a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: it grows almost identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds almost look identical,
almost smell identical, but the ghost just
[SPEAKER_02]: has a little bit more of this rich anise
to it compared to the SFV as far as the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little more earthy, just a little bit
more of the anise or I don't know what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less a tennis ball.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still look the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the feeling on the ghost is
way different than the SFV, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else is the same, you know,
in our garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause SFV was a little more piney and a
little more earthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they, they, the flavor wise is
almost identical on the two cuts that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the ghost just gives me this
narcotic feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes me eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for any cancer patients or people
that are lacking, uh, appetite,
[SPEAKER_02]: I give them ghost or ghost edibles or
ghost something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like what I saved that strain for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It saved a lot of people in my family and
a lot of people in my life, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's one of those ones you can smoke
in the morning, afternoon, evening,
[SPEAKER_01]: right before you go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for everyone, but not for everybody,
but it will get you high every time you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it every single time for 15 years or
whatever, how long I've, I've been running
[SPEAKER_02]: it, um, or smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott reach, uh, rare dankness is the
first guy that gave me the ghost and the
[SPEAKER_02]: SFV and he would sell me the flowers,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: One week, Scott would give me two ounces
of ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the next week, Scott would give me two
ounces of SFV and I would notice my moods
[SPEAKER_02]: were different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the flower tasted the same,
but I would notice my moods were different
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was like smoking on ghost for a
week compared to smoking on SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually I got those exact
cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Scott gave me the SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Scott.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later down the line, I always wanted
the ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott wouldn't give it to me later down
the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rich who was partners with Scott gave me,
sorry, Scott, but rich gave and rich gave
[SPEAKER_02]: me the ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever smoked the star killer from
Scott?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's not like real OG to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's an OG cross, just like you were
saying about, you know, these,
[SPEAKER_02]: these hybridized things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't like OG if it's a cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only want the clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to smoke gas, I actually
can't smoke sour really or chem anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only want clone only OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sour in the chem just doesn't give me
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need my ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the, the star killer has a
amazing effect and it's a long effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's longer than the typical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little more uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little more racy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for me, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need the, the ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need my clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't like ghost train haze then I
guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was one Fino that we'd like to
wash because it was super rare that
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with Terpenelein would actually
wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have this ghost train haze that
smelled and tastes like lemon lime,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Sprite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we call it the Sprite Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it would wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I like, um, and I liked that it
didn't really have too much Terpenelein.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had just enough to give it the Sprite
sensation or that flavor, but not taste
[SPEAKER_02]: like Terpenelein.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more on the limiting side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you see the industry going in
the next five years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think technology is going to prevail
automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of these larger scale,
you know, equipment companies are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's going to be less manual
because it costs a lot to put your hands
[SPEAKER_02]: on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every touching point costs a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can eliminate those touching points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you're going to save your company a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very craft oriented and hands on,
but I think that's where the future is
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're going to be cutting us,
you know, little guys out, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that will prevail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even with breeding the tools we
have now for breeding, it's, it's a game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer and genomics marker driven
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all, it's all going to change
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drastically in some ways, especially
getting from point a to point Z being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to skip, you know, skip multiple steps,
speed up the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brands and money will always control
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what we're doing, like that's
what's going to, that's what's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just got to stick with the quality
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about, for me, it's all about
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like having the best product because you
have a better product than you have a leg
[SPEAKER_01]: up on other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, no, no, I'm, I'm blessed to stay
smoking my own little living soil grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finding some homies that also have
living soil grows that don't add too much
[SPEAKER_02]: sweetener or this or that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping it real with the living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could go back to the younger
nicotine, it was in the industry for maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: two years and you had one piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, trust your instinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just like my natural instinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust your instinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but also take initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this industry is still emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still brand new in a lot of places
throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take initiative, um, be creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think this just our world in
general right now is so opened up for the
[SPEAKER_02]: creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know, go viral with one post
type of situation and just look at that on
[SPEAKER_02]: a, on a big scale, be creative in the
space and find your own passion too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like finding something that's
different, um, that you're passionate
[SPEAKER_02]: about could change game for our industry
and for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you have drive and
determination, there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do, you can do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you, if you do anything that
you're, you know, especially anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're passionate about, if you're
passionate about it and you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: drive and determination, you can conquer,
conquer whatever that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can be a, a force in that,
whether you want to do cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started in the industry,
when it was the gray market, the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market, whatever you want to call it,
the legacy market, you had to do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be the construction guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be the extractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I did all that stuff, designer,
packaging, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was one of the first guys in my
group of friends that had like packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: on my, on my flower, you know,
and I had some blueberry back then I made
[SPEAKER_01]: labels where I think I still have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in like the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yo, you had to do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can be a specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be a perfectionist in one,
one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you want to do genetics or you
want to do extract and you want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you do a lot of stuff,
you know, it's like with the DJ,
[SPEAKER_02]: but even with doing a lot, you know,
I've got like an amazing team behind me
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of the things that I'm doing,
you know, for these essential education
[SPEAKER_02]: classes that I'm teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like a team of graphic designers
and web designers and just a support
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I do a lot, but also I'm trying to
be more focused on what I know I'm good
[SPEAKER_02]: at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not good at the backend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at the graphic design.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at, um, you know,
a lot of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been, I think a big learning point
in the industry also is a delegation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not over delegating, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, delegating what you're not good
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you over delegate, you can learn a
lesson real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I learned that lesson as,
as a kid, a couple of years into the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, you know, honesty is so
important, not just with other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you need to, people need to take a
hard look in the mirror and realize what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're good at and what they're not good
at and be real about it and focus on your
[SPEAKER_01]: strengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's, that's the best
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, constantly evolve, constantly
pivot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's in this industry and in this
world, if you're stagnant, if you stuck
[SPEAKER_02]: with one thing, you're going to get
random.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's another reason I'm
blessed to still be here is I've
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly pivoted as the industry has
evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing wrong with reinventing
yourself or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen multiple people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dougie is the best example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dougie is someone who has reinvented
himself several times since I've known him
[SPEAKER_01]: and fricking comes out on top every time
it crushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Dougie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always supported Dougie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause Dougie has always been good to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I've always been good to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, right now, um, I'm hoping I'm coming
back down here to Cali for the best of
[SPEAKER_02]: California, but we're still figuring some
things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's another pioneer that just,
he, he, uh, he goes through stuff and he
[SPEAKER_01]: takes the good with the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen him go through tough
times and I've seen him on top and he
[SPEAKER_01]: just, he's, he's a fighter too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not giving up and he's super
passionate, loves weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, he has a lot to say about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, and he's just a really
good guy at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, he's a really good
guy who gives a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be having to do a dab a do next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess when they, when they air this
episode, it will be 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: So later this year, we will probably have
to do another 10 year anniversary dab a do
[SPEAKER_01]: with Mila in the Bay area.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'll host it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find the location.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get Dougie in on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be fun for the four of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to cook too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will actually, I'll probably pay people
to cook, but I have good friends that are
[SPEAKER_01]: chefs and I'll have the most amazing food.
