[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud Podcast, and today our special guest
[SPEAKER_02]: is Chris O'Farrell, the author of this
book, 100 grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met originally at Emerald Cup earlier
this year, and you are also
[SPEAKER_02]: self-published.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you and I can talk about all the crazy
things that it means to be self-published
[SPEAKER_02]: and the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of stuff we can pass
on to people that are interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: publishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, I wanted to get into your book
and talk about 100 grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both have books that came out around
the right time because I feel like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a need for someone to write a book on how
to get better yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just for breeding, I feel like we're
way overdue for a breeding book that had a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of detail on breeding that was
detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was excited to write a book,
and then self-publishing, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was going to be a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we thought was going to be a year and
a half, two-year project quickly unfolded
[SPEAKER_01]: into three and a half years and then
trying to pull things together at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still trying to work on
marketing for ourselves, so it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: just a long process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So three and a half years from start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine was five years, and I thought I could
do it in one because I had this big ego in
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, dude, I could knock this out in one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And originally, I thought it was going to
be 30,000 words, and we ended up with
[SPEAKER_02]: 115,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had over 20 people that contributed
to the books, whether it was photographs,
[SPEAKER_02]: videos, a chapter on tissue culture,
a chapter on intellectual property and
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it unfolded and turned into this thing
that was much bigger than myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think a lot of times books do.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, same over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we thought would be a short process
took a lot longer, especially when you
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting other folks involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start getting those critiques.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you think, and you honestly end
up learning more throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I learned so much from start to
finish about breeding, and a lot of things
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: With cultivation and LEDs and stuff that,
had I not taken five years and put the
[SPEAKER_02]: book out five years ago, it would have
been outdated by the time 2024 rolled
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: With LEDs and doing reversals in my
experimentations, I did a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: experimenting with LEDs and HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't getting good reversals with LEDs,
whereas HPS, I got this amazing reverse
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dumped out pollen, whereas I get 20%
reversals with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the difference is the far red.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat, the far red, there's a couple
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But HPS for the win, especially for
reversals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in this modern world, a lot of us are
using LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use LEDs for phenohunting because a lot
of my customers that buy seeds use LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your take on LED versus HPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you can grow a great flower
under both.
[SPEAKER_01]: With lights, honestly, I think there's
also something to be said about having
[SPEAKER_01]: more sophisticated LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the company Phos, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really taking things to the next
level with the spectrum tuning
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple companies doing it,
but I work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I work with science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spectrum tuning is legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potential for spectrum tuning and the
future of spectrum tuning, we're just
[SPEAKER_02]: scratching the surface with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much potential for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of the stuff is really
going to be cultivar-specific,
[SPEAKER_02]: which lighting is kind of anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can just look at HPS versus
LED, and you go blue dream, HPS all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it under LED, and it gets a
different expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the OGs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I haven't run that many OGs,
but I've heard from a couple people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing the best OG that I've smoked
that CMH is actually the best spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've had similar experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some strains, some cultivars
rather, that they'll dump 80, 90 grams a
[SPEAKER_01]: square, not finicky at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under HPS, before I made the transition,
and now putting them under more intense
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, they just don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super finicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't take as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the skittles that my friend
grows under LED is way better than my HPS
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles that I was growing in 2018,
leagues above.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just experimented the living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked it a couple of podcasts ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to smoke some today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like it's like dialing in the
cultivar for the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different nutrient regimens, lighting
regimens, PPFD comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you go into that in your book
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The importance of PPFD and basically crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop steering is everything that's
happening in the room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: From climate to your fertigation and
substrate management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally everything surrounding the plant
is crop steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a lot of people get this confused,
it's not just, what are you doing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how are you tailoring your VPD,
your light levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: It all comes into play when you're
steering something a certain way in that
[SPEAKER_01]: either high stress environment or that low
stress environment to promote ripening,
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, fruit development, and then
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and VPD is a tricky one too,
because I think a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have the Trollmaster and they're
like, well, it's in the range of the VPD,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they're not accounting for
surface temperature of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at least I think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a learning curve still where
people are like, oh, I just use this chart
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's all encompassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, it'll work, but you're
not optimizing the VPD in those
[SPEAKER_02]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely no one size fits all
and having those IR sensors going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, which not a lot of folks use,
will definitely help you dial that part of
[SPEAKER_01]: that process.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technology has just come a long ways
in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then guys like Josh and Ramsey,
that have kind of moved the needle
[SPEAKER_02]: forward, especially with crop steering and
then books like this coming out to where
[SPEAKER_02]: the information is accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to just know the right
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you can buy a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the beginning it's like,
oh, well, who do you know that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: share their secrets with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was the whole thought behind
the book, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we all, since starting getting
into what we all do now, it's always been
[SPEAKER_01]: this search for good information,
because 90% of it's bad and bringing it
[SPEAKER_01]: all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a digestible manner where you can look
through, it's very textbook style,
[SPEAKER_01]: but wanted to give it coffee table vibes
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to go through and figure
out which one of these cardinal parameters
[SPEAKER_01]: am I having issues with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can just go through the steps
of your troubleshooting.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had two friends steal the book
already and I had to go back and get it
[SPEAKER_02]: from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a great book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's easy to digest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas some textbooks are super
complicated and they go over your head and
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to keep on going.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can actually pick it apart chapter
by chapter, or you can go to specific
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that you're interested about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I wrote a book similar in that
sense where it's like, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: digestible information and there's
something for everybody in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you read it, you're going to learn
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually started reading your book
recently too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging it so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell that there was a ton of work
put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really did, you know, so I wrote the
book about five times and threw away the
[SPEAKER_02]: first four versions of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last time, the last draft was
kind of a start to finish and I wrote it
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically based on the other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I brought an editor in named
Angela Baca.
[SPEAKER_02]: She basically picked it apart and was
like, no, we need to rearrange it this
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, no, no, I think it would
make more sense if we go from here to
[SPEAKER_02]: here, to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very linear in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people can understand it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she, she had a lot of good points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sometimes it takes the outside
perspective looking in to go, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, this is how you should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought in a bunch of former colleagues,
Stuart Wilcox, former COO of Curely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted that high level perspective
of, you know, does it read well for folks
[SPEAKER_01]: that are, you know, at that upper echelon
of companies, is it going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, able to provide value to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought in some folks, my buddies at
Grow Dan, John Jericovich went through
[SPEAKER_01]: Reddit, gave me good feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liam Spencer, who's actually working for a
science LED for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's actually a craft specialist
for Arroyo now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real good kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably five other guys I'm forgetting
right now, but yeah, that alternate or
[SPEAKER_01]: additional perspective is what really
turned that book into something great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the more people that touch the
book, the bigger it becomes in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just outgrows you and you're
part of something so much bigger than
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, and these books,
you know, they have value.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could last a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's just so many things,
but let's talk about yields for a second,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I love the title of your book,
but also what is the largest yield you've
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten?
[SPEAKER_01]: Largest suit I've gotten probably around
130 grams a square.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is like five pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give or take.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pushing that five pound envelope with
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe it's quality, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use great inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a great team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do all our crop work on schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, you know, we don't cut corners
anywhere throughout our processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that goes a long way with the
final product at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most recently, don't mean to interrupt,
we hit 110 grams two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime we do something good like that,
we always take the team out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to make sure the team's
taken care of because those are the folks
[SPEAKER_01]: really making it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what kind of scale is this at?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people are curious about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is right now I'm running 1,500
square foot rooms of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, you know, I've run hundreds of
thousands of square feet of canopy and
[SPEAKER_01]: working for Cura Leaf in different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But currently I'm running 1,500 square
foot rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just small enough to still kind of be
craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too big to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Rockwool is your substrate of
choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Love Rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running that in our Perumcro right
now and seeing great results there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cocoa flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rockwool probably has the best
look.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cocoa probably is the most dynamic
and soil I think has the best flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get great flavor out of
Rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Rockwool is, you know, Rockwool is
probably the, the, as far as like being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to control, you can have a lot more
control with Rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller substrate to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going, I feel like it's a
little bit more accurate too, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to like, uh, you know, cause we do
like a 10% dry back overnight and then 3%
[SPEAKER_02]: per hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, at least that's what
we do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and everybody has their own way of
doing it, but I feel like the Rockwool,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can really do that in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it'll, it'll vary from pot to
pot a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more variability, which sometimes
requires more sensors, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get better, more averages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you have the average,
you can dial it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only as good as the, or your
decisions are only as good as the data
[SPEAKER_01]: sets you have to make them from.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how many sensors do you feel like
you should have, uh, in a room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in a room, I don't really go by per
room per se, but I go about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: per square foot, I'd say about one sensor
per 150 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what sensors do you think work
the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it depends on the substrate,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have the GrowSense, which
obviously probably, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I use is GrowSense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use GrowSense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for drybacks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we also have Agritech.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use more than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Redundancy is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Arroyo though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with them for a couple
of years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, great platform, easy to read and
interpret the data to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have the redundancy
built in with their climate stations and
[SPEAKER_01]: such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can compare that to whatever your,
uh, you know, existing building management
[SPEAKER_01]: system was before you implemented that
MCR, uh, operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually have Arroyo sensors here
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't have the Arroyo system
anymore, but like, I feel like I would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're all about A-B testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to, I would love to compare the
data between Arroyo and GrowSense because
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they're both good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's like how,
how much off is each one?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I getting better results with one than
the other?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that with everything from the
irrigation skid that I showed you earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what keeps me excited every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come in and I'm like, okay, well it's
almost like I can play with this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also data driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm trying to do it in a
productive, uh, scientific way.
[SPEAKER_02]: To where we get actual data that's
valuable instead of just playing around.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, cause a lot of people, they like to
play around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand ways to skin a cat,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: With cultivation, it's like harvest date,
depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want more candy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want more gas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want it stronger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want it more mild?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using it for extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of those things come into play
and we're planning our rooms out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's for us at least, it's always a
collaborative effort, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's doing well at the retail
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, you know, goes back to the lab,
our production team, our extraction team.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we need to formulate different
products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's a live resin gummy that we
need a specific flavor profile for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll make sure we have an allocation
in the room for things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll send just a fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What cartridges are doing well in terms of
live resin pens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing there, allocations for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, what finished flour do
we really want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one of our stores?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in the cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doing the Lord's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a challenge these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I just do the nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we don't have any, we don't have any,
we don't sell flour or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we do phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do testing, um, and the nursery model,
which I love, uh, licensing, genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to go direct to consumer with
the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be a consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get some of your cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we're, we're looking for
people to partner with in other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that, that could be an
interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have an R&D room coming online in a
couple of months up in Pahrump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we should do some fun things out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love testing things in different
environments and seeing what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: results people get and comparing COAs,
but also comparing opinions on flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause I think different regions
and different places have, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: different desires as far as what kind of
end product works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like California, the Bay area,
LA, purple candy gas is like really what
[SPEAKER_02]: they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can go more gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can go more candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can go more or less purple,
but it's really kind of in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you might be able to sell some sour
diesel or some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: These days, surprising blue dreams made a
huge comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and maybe it never left completely,
but like now it's, it's popular everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: People really love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting cause the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it definitely lost some steam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember buddies, you know,
running all their garages and houses and
[SPEAKER_01]: up, up in the pooter cane and just blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never had any problem getting rid of
anything for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then probably two six,
2016, 2017 came around and then that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when you guys have really started really
getting creative with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we had it in, uh, early or
early to mid two thousands and that's when
[SPEAKER_02]: it had its day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as the clones got out,
the price dropped on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like one of the worst
years of my life because I was like so
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on growing blue dream and then
Christmas came around and I had all these
[SPEAKER_02]: packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long story, but, uh, once the
market got flooded with it, it was so easy
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first thing that was kind
of like, Oh, it was easy to get over two
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds of light for almost anybody,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now people are like, Oh,
two pounds of light isn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to hit three to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody, but like at a commercial
scale, I think a lot of people are looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for that three pound of light number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that all boils down to your margins
and costing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like taking that lean approach,
eliminating steps and having a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: can yield heavier is just going to bring
your costs down across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have some friends that run
double stack in, they have a rec grow down
[SPEAKER_02]: the street and they have a double stack
and their cost per pound to produce it is
[SPEAKER_02]: they get over three pounds light is like
$280.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per pound indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, you know, 600 was the average
for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the average is now probably five,
maybe four 75 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in rec, uh, we have high electricity
here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not like Washington state
is seven cents a kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like 39 cents a kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 12 cents a kilowatt up in Vegas
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also hitting, I think right around
dollar per gram after dry trim care
[SPEAKER_01]: testing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in a package, but no, but that's a
good, that's a good number to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like anybody who's getting below
that is doing some miracles, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to get those numbers and you
know, the double stack plays a huge role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cultivar selection is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything boils down to genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics is now and will forever be the
backbone of every operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're only as good as your,
your weakest guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have strong genetics,
you're going to have strong crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: pest and pathogen free, good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and it's such a big,
big thing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, for the longest time we
really didn't talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were worried about spider mites and
then it was rude aphids and maybe some,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, broad mites and russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but now it's like, we got to worry
about pathogens like significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do significant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if you're, if you get your
blinders on still, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: burned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get, you're going to get
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trading cuts with everybody,
like it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's like having sex in the
eighties without protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about getting that good
quarantine, having them come from reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: source, going through all the pathogen
testing and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viroids are a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, you know, if you're not managing
your structure correctly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get real bad if you sorry,
moxie sporum problems by just giving them
[SPEAKER_01]: that perfect oversaturated environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for serum is a thing we don't
talk about enough because we're so focused
[SPEAKER_02]: on hoplite and virid, but for serum is a
big problem and it's out there everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one that I'm seeing
everywhere with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people will say, no,
that's hoplite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut a stump open.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you get your start in
cultivation and everything that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, uh, I was in the Marine Corps
infantry for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I mean, prior to that,
I was a river guide on the Shenandoah
[SPEAKER_01]: Potomac rivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just always been real fascinated
by plant medicine, you know, mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi, adaptogenic herbs, cannabis,
obviously threw a little bit of weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: sold a little bit of weed back then,
nothing of scale or, anything of note,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, that was, that was the initial
thing that kind of perked my interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after getting out of the Marine
Corps, moved out to Colorado, had some
[SPEAKER_01]: buddies that were running caregiver
operations, did a lot of work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was real fortunate to learn a lot from
those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was my start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably spent about three years,
uh, growing in Colorado, up in the Poudre
[SPEAKER_01]: Canyon, Fort Collins, native roots and
Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, uh, East Coast market started
opening up, took a move East, did some
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting, uh, rewrote some curriculums
for the Cleveland school of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: their commercial cultivation operations
course and their cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got picked up by Cureleaf,
helped them design some facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: start some facilities, uh, kind of in a
regional capacity there for about a year
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half while the first facility in
Ohio was getting built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, it was with them for about
three years and then, uh, wanted to move
[SPEAKER_01]: back home to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ended up, uh, being reached out
to for the company I'm working for now,
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep Roots Harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And went out there, met with the team,
the executive team, was super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, ended up, you know, going out
there, working with them and have been
[SPEAKER_01]: with them now for three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done a lot of good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you were in Fort Collins,
did you get to try that Fort Collins
[SPEAKER_02]: cough?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fort Collins cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fort Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: A specific store breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was, so that's a, an L5 Hayes cross
that's, uh, extremely special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some breeding with it a couple of
years ago and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, the thing is, is like the
outdoor growers, they struggle with it
[SPEAKER_02]: because it gets so tall, it'll go right
over your fence line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just keeps getting taller and
taller and taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, even in the end, it's still,
you know, it's still growing throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but yeah, it's, it's,
it's hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a real strong funk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like I missed out on something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a special one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I haven't seen,
I haven't seen it grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about people that grow it
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen pictures on Instagram of it
grown indoors, but most of the time I've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen it is outside and I grew it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running, uh, probably three things
predominantly out there, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the, you know, bigger ops that
I was running, but, uh, space queen from
[SPEAKER_01]: TG or a sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love space queen, 303 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it was Sasquatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Hindu Kush, Grape Ape and,
uh, Uzbekistan Hash Plant Cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard of Sasquatch in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful pink flowers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the bag of peel unmatched.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't see things like that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, Golden Goat, one of my all
time favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong with some good Golden
Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny story about Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, in my freezer, I still have Golden
Goat, uh, BHO from 2018 that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: saving and I still smoke it every once in
a while, bust it out, warm it up and dab
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, extract just stays good
forever, especially good sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sauce and diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually from House of Cultivar,
my good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just, I've just saved it ever
since.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I always given it at Emerald Cup in
2018 and I still have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Golden Goat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the turps on it are loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's like got that nose burning lemon
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fills a whole house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, yeah, I've never grown it or anything
like that, but I really liked the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the effect too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great plant structure, great yielder and
great, great flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's got some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they get enough credit all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't either, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they got Adam Dunn in his podcast,
ruining it all for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, he's a good friend of mine,
but yeah, he's a, he's got some good
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing, we did some Sage and Sour
crosses together and that's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite or one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat Piss is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't really get to see them too often
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat Piss is definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour, I've just reconnected with Sour,
uh, at Reggae on the River this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's one of our local
favorite varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, but we do have some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like Skittles?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got some Skittles and then we got some
Krippie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're calling this stuff Uncle Rick's
Krippie and it's like this old school OG
[SPEAKER_02]: variety that's super gassy, super special
in my opinion, different than everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else that's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super frosty, but it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loud, like extremely like pungent where it
burns your nose, but it's OG and you just
[SPEAKER_02]: don't see gassy stuff like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, uh, we probably have two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a little bit of gas from our,
uh, our Gorilla Goo, but not like the old,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we were talking about that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how we have this reoccurring
things like Gorilla Glue keeps popping
[SPEAKER_02]: back up and you know, I like Gorilla Glue
for what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of like came in and I'm one of the
guys who got the cut from, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Josie Wales in 2013 and I believe it was
2013 at the Cup in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either that or 2014 right at the
end there, uh, of 13 or early part of 14
[SPEAKER_02]: at the Cup in San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were, they, they did the best
thing ever was they gave the cut out to
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody and that blew it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd won the Cup and they gave out
clones to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to a bunch of my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we made moms of it and mom did out and
gave cuts to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it replaced sour diesel within
about a year of all the people that were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing sour diesel for not, not all of
them, but a lot of them, uh, especially up
[SPEAKER_02]: on the hills in Sonoma, Mendo,
Humboldt, they were growing sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you get something that's
gassy, it's better yields and finishes
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to worry about rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about botrytis and
PM and all these other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big flowers on that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's got some chocolate
notes in it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like really funky gas with
chocolate notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And strong and like the effect was strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't, you can't really find those
cuts anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at least not the stable ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to a few times now and most of
the ones I picked up just her.
[SPEAKER_02]: For gorilla?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh dude, we, I can get you a gorilla cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get the GG four.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes a few months, but yeah,
that one's around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we got, we got a good amount of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem 91 is coming out of culture right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about to give that back to Greg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, the 91 chem dog is extremely
special in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's got its own kind of gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's that burnt tire chemi kind
of, you know, the structure is not the
[SPEAKER_02]: best on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got decent structure, but it's,
it's soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds are soft and they're,
they're nice big buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like open bracts, but it's not like,
uh, not like sour diesel where it
[SPEAKER_02]: completely fingers out where you got these
stacked bracts or Fox tails that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and sour diesel doesn't always
Fox tail like that, but a lot of times it
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of the, uh, not a lot of
them, but a fair amount of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: older genetics Fox tail a good bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that can be a quality thing
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with Fox tail as long as it's
fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I come from a time where it didn't
matter as much what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all about, the loudness and the
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, which I think people are going to
start going back towards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like with white thorn rose hitting
the market as strong as it did this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with that
one, but a white thorn hit hard and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: from Huckleberry hill farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those feel good strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the strongest in the world,
but it just makes you feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the effect that the turps
are good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, that effect is what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm anticipating something similar with
the, with the market shift like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most bang for your buck mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how much can I get in a bag?
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest THC with the lowest cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's gonna, you know,
I'm sure it'll always be there for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, but I think there's going to be
a different, you know, demographic that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come out similar to folks that
like wine and, you know, good drinks,
[SPEAKER_01]: like good mixed drinks where people are
just looking for specific flavor profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: things to pair things with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor chasers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got lots of flavor chasers out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with the potential I mean,
we were kind of talking about making
[SPEAKER_02]: salads the other day about mixing up
different flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely rosin can be easily blended
where you can take 25% this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do skittles 75 and we're
going to throw in something else to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it special, you know, or whatever 50 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think you can really,
you know, the options are limitless on the
[SPEAKER_02]: directions you can go with blending,
especially with stuff like rosin or
[SPEAKER_03]: extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what you think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should let you dry hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the dirt skittles, uh, soil grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did an interesting test where we
took skittles grown in soil and skittles
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the only difference throughout
the whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same light, same nutrition, United
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the only difference was the
substrate soil versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we smoked them side by side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it on the show with Hallie from a
Humboldt seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like so significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best, best suite I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely living soil blueberry
diesel, like probably 2016 or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that blueberry diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the best thing you've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like from batch to batch,
I've smoked amazing things all over
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best batch of skittles that I've ever
smoked was this one right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really did this stuff coats,
uh, the ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rolled this one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a fatty four grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you get better flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a flavor chaser, not the bigger,
the better always, but there's that sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's depending on the tip too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're using like a 12 or a 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it hits different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get better airflow and you get more
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone's got their own thing going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of the, and this,
this ash isn't looking as pretty today as
[SPEAKER_02]: it did yesterday, but we'll smoke some of
the other ones too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean dirt skittles, something special
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's coats.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a good coat, but yeah,
I think I roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing with that I'm learning with
hand rolls, we call them hand rolls
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of pre rolls, but with the hand
rolls, uh, you want to smoke them fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: After you roll them, they start to,
even if you put them in a joint tube,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not quite as good a week later as
they would be for the first couple of days
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is still amazing, but it's just a
little bit more mouth coating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you're getting more turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're volatile, you know, evaporate off
at room temperature.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each cultivar is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some cultivars are good for months.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're exactly, once they hit their peak,
they're good and you could put them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: turplock bag or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have those guys on, but love those
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're a game changer in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they changed my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I'm like, one of those guys who
doesn't believe things are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times I'm, there's so much snake
oil out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another mylar bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, if you actually do your,
your homework and you do any trials with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you'll see that they're better,
especially better than turkey bags,
[SPEAKER_02]: better than mason jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, mason jars, your buds don't get
smashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think using a controlled
environment where it's cool, then you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to, the guesswork, you pull the
guesswork out if you're using a turplock,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially like in that curing phase where
you don't have to burp it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of people, they screw it up
within that, you know, post harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, for the week after two weeks after
three weeks after they're not releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: that CO2 out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't release it, then moisture
gets trapped in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what turplocks do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, from a, you know,
operational perspective, it just makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense for, you know, efficiency,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then you're not having, you know,
a couple of guys that are strictly just
[SPEAKER_01]: run around, depending on the scale,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Popping toads, popping buckets,
popping turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that, we were talking about this
yesterday, but then when you got people
[SPEAKER_02]: manually doing it, uh, it becomes an art
where you have to be skilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it in a turplock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a mechanically done instead of
manually done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, okay, it does it itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just, you don't have to worry
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one less thing you have to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the less things you have to worry
about that, you know, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful, the better your end product is
probably going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could focus, uh, you know,
your efforts you would have spent on that
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about efficiencies at the end,
uh, especially when you're getting into
[SPEAKER_02]: scale and cost efficiencies where you're
trying to save money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
you know, especially with guys that are
[SPEAKER_02]: producing flour, it's like such a
competition and race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the middle, if you're
creating a superior product, not so much
[SPEAKER_02]: the race to the bottom, but you still have
to be conscious of your price.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, price compression is hitting
everybody, you know, at a national level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with the exception of a few
states that are just opening up the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical markets, but just a matter of time
being cognizant of that from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the right, you know, mechanical
equipment in place, the right workflow,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the right people there to get
things done the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a good staff is everything and good
work culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, that's, that's everything
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to, your people want to come
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They enjoy working.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, they wouldn't want to be
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you got a winning recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not involved in the kickball,
the kickball teams, the softball leagues
[SPEAKER_01]: and the mud volleyball and all that stuff
with the team, you should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was those little things like,
uh, that make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times even, you know,
the little jobs can be stressful at times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that we don't do any hand water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done with hand watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we will hand water in the tent,
but like, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I've had friends that were hand watering
forever and finally have switched over in
[SPEAKER_02]: the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, man, you just have so much
time for other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one less thing you, you don't
have to worry about and you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: train somebody on and hope they're doing
it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's repeatable, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things that's repeatable
time and time again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're doing five harvests a year
out of that room, you know, the watering
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be successful because you got
sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes life easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want those things to be easy because
there's so many other things that'll
[SPEAKER_02]: stress you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, like the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything's kind of volatile
right now, but what state are you in
[SPEAKER_02]: again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nevada is volatile too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys have, you know, rec has been
introduced for the past couple of years,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you guys have like one of the largest
dispensaries in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Planet 13 out in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're a partner of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planet 13 does real well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have a great breakfast spot
right across inside that same building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend checking that place out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me one of the biggest things you
learned from writing this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably adjusting my own expectations of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, you know, kind of going back to
how we, uh, we started our talk,
[SPEAKER_01]: just being, being patient with the process
more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cause and then, you know,
don't let good get in the way of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or don't like perfect get in the way
of good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like me and my co-author, Lukeable Journey
went back and forth a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, Oh, it's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd like, you know, sit down,
read a chapter and be like, we could do
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'd read, I'd read an article and be
like, huh, I feel like, I feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: should, you know, make something from this
into a certain section, just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just like, every time we thought
we were about done, there was just more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because if you've never
written a book, you probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: relate to it as much, but like mine,
I feel like there was information coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out at the last minute where we abstracts
tech, for instance, wrote a white paper,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually multiple white papers on
flavorants, which are, they did a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flavor molecules like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to include that in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to like, add this to the book
right before we were going to layout or
[SPEAKER_02]: like, no, we need to add this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to be, I talked to Angela and I'm
like, what do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, yeah, we should probably
figure out how to include it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pretty game-changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I actually read all the
papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed them to a couple other people and
we were like, yeah, this needs to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we don't put it in the book,
it's going to need to go in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: version, but it's out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't finalized everything,
even though we felt like we'd finalized
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a whole bunch of little
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then photo placement, where are we
going to place all the photos?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a lengthy process,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then picking those photos too,
you know, like you'll probably have five
[SPEAKER_01]: for each section.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want one and then going through and
well, I like this one, but she likes that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Paul likes this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, trying to come
together and figure out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what's going to be the best for each
section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had two photographers that did
a lot of the heavy lifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on top of that, we had Ariane
from Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Ace Seeds contributing photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had so many people contributing photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Jodry got me some, there's a bunch
of people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of were very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, yeah, I'll help contribute
to your book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Mojave Richman is another
guy, contributed some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did case studies in my book too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to keep ours as, as tight knit as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of previous textbooks we
had read, not going to name any,
[SPEAKER_01]: had, you know, tons of advertisements,
you know, use this, use that, use these
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, use these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, I feel like that it moves away
from being a textbook to being a magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to like preserve the
authenticity and just have like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, raw, you know, usable
information that's going to be applicable
[SPEAKER_01]: to, you know, the reason why folks should
buy that book, not like a, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, shout out to this company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you're pushing people in any one
direction for products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put the facts out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let people make their mind up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we do talk about some products,
but I try to make it as non-biased as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible and just telling people the
facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's, that's the best way
with the textbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be information for people
to digest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not supposed to be a magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that about your book too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we mentioned a few products as
well, you know, like floor flex and Jax
[SPEAKER_01]: just for simplicity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like from a costing perspective can't be,
you know, one and a half cents per gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: start to finish on average.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jax is the blue stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's blue powder.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy used Jax for a long time,
swore by Jax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used Jax, but I've seen some
stuff growing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For simplicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't beat a one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the costing too, you know,
like a lot of the nutrient lines nowadays,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven to 14 cents a gallon, depending on,
you know, how much you're ordering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you just, you know, it's like,
that's why dry, rather than by the gallon,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like using dry is like so much more
economical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also like the carbon, we got sold the
idea that we need liquid fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so crazy because you look at
any other form of ag, they're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not loaded up on these liquid five
gallon concentrate bottles that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: get powder of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you're buying a thousand
pounds of salts versus, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the equivalent into liquid, you're talking
about, you know, tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in like freight charges associated
with that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start penciling it out,
like the difference in price, just by the
[SPEAKER_02]: weight of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, they have stabilizers and the
thing is, is maybe we didn't have as good
[SPEAKER_02]: a quality stuff before they didn't done
all the R and D for buffers and
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilizers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have that technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: People understand it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's only a handful of
companies that actually make the dry
[SPEAKER_02]: powder for everybody anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the cannabis tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of times you can go to the ag
world and get stuff for ag that's pennies
[SPEAKER_02]: on the dollar from the cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not hating on any nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you guys all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all of the nutrient companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you used all of them from advanced to
house and garden to Kana?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Front row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like front row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I like Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the Kana hat on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like United is what we're using now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Athena's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, dude, I've, I've used so many GH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used GH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still use GH PH up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the longest time I was doing this,
uh, botanic care with flora Nova was the
[SPEAKER_02]: secret recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this super complex recipe that
you could never use with dosers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, it would, cause there was 18
different things and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was complicated and it grew really
good flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, man, it's like those old recipes
is the weed better or was the weed better
[SPEAKER_02]: back then with 18 things?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think you're over-complicating
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I get at certain flush recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have some different stuff
and we have a special flush recipe that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have that was developed by one of our
friends that works phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a bunch of components in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, it's like a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to hand flush everything,
but, but you get white ash and you get
[SPEAKER_02]: really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, the proof is in the
pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to Bruce Bugsby about this
actually, before speaking on a facility
[SPEAKER_01]: design at the cannabis business times
conference, like a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, from a plant physiology
perspective, it doesn't make any sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: deprive the plant up in nutrients up until
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people do flush, depending on
what you are flushing, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people who do just RO or just tap
water or pH water, you know, if you
[SPEAKER_01]: deprive your plant of calcium,
you know, that'll result in petritis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you do it for too long,
are you actually flushing the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you look at the plant,
what's deficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers aren't deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The foliage is deficient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that fade in the foliage,
but it's not really affecting the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a, you know, 10 ways to look at
it and break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something you're doing for a costing
perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in terms of a year, you know,
56 chops cut out, you know, four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be some savings depending on
the, uh, the scale of the operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as, uh, you know, quality of
the finished product goes, I think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something to be said about like,
uh, you know, how the chlorophyll can
[SPEAKER_01]: break down and, uh, you know, how that
flower can cure by removing some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then calcium, I think a lot of
people are using calcium to get whiter
[SPEAKER_02]: ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think I hear different opinions
on calcium and the benefits of actually
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it uptaking a bunch of that calcium?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm seeing better, better ash with
calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I think molasses is in
the big one, putting sugar in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some carboload.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some carboload, some sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those simple and complex sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at the end of the day,
if you can improve the flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: why not do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also make it more smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's ways to make it more smooth,
increase the flavor, I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about that, that end user
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cause at the end of the day,
you're providing experience for the
[SPEAKER_02]: customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a chef would for,
uh, someone dining at their restaurant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and blower is no different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fresh product and it comes out
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at scale, even the best environments,
there's still a slight variation because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many things that go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly the same product that
comes out every harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, you get a lot more similar,
the more dialed in your system is,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially like using like rock wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you start talking chemo types,
you can get tighter chemo type
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's still is a living product
that can change from time to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also you get some systemic bacteria in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a totally different expression
or you get some stressors, some thrips,
[SPEAKER_02]: some mites, whatever it is, you know,
it's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: stressors will make the plant more terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a known fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have friends that have thrips and
their, their stuff is super terpy and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, what's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, don't ever come to my
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, they might have a point
to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I think there is a couple,
there is a couple of compounds or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, uh, brands that are making,
uh, things to foliar that actually act as
[SPEAKER_02]: stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harpen proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we're still learning about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always learning, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second you stop learning, that's,
that's where, you know, your improvements
[SPEAKER_01]: of any kind of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as data collection, how much
data collection do you guys do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we do a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't all the top of my head,
probably give you a data point number,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean many different data points from
the substrate, the environmentals,
[SPEAKER_01]: the climate, PPFD readings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we get a lot of data points just from
like an efficiency perspective with our
[SPEAKER_01]: shift reports from all of our supervisors,
you know, what's done, how long did it
[SPEAKER_01]: take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also in the middle of building a
very robust, uh, addition to our,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cultivation management software now
where we're adding cost again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to actually be able to,
you know, apply true costs to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how long did it take, you know,
down to the milliliter of everything used
[SPEAKER_01]: to the, to the hour of labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how you get efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys measure your plants,
um, going into, for, for, for growth on a
[SPEAKER_02]: weekly or daily basis ever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to for, for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I start new things out, you know,
like measuring internodal spacing and stem
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've kind of moved away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's not as beneficial information
after a period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then dialing in your PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the best way to dial your PPFD in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really looking for plant responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as you're photo acclimating
things, you know, see an adverse plant
[SPEAKER_01]: response where it's like, oh, you know,
obviously the plants got too much light
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, it has that slight,
it's not turgid, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The turgidity of the plant with the water
pushing on the soil walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not praying as everybody calls the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want to see that turgidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're VP, he's dialed in a room,
you'll see your turgidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if your light's good, your VPD is
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got a good pressure in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want happy, healthy plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're cutting clones,
whether you're flowering, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want praying plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just being cognizant of those,
those light levels, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like certain, certain ones can take more
than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just knowing that going into the game,
you know, not trying to use that cookie
[SPEAKER_01]: cutter to every single one of your rooms,
every single part of your room,
[SPEAKER_01]: going into knowing that, you know,
old school, I mean, if you can get over
[SPEAKER_01]: 600 micromoles in here, it's not going to
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your gosh man, so you can hit
with 1400 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to throw down five
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going for that same thing with the
super booth yields like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you see the future of people
pushing even higher numbers per square
[SPEAKER_02]: foot?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had some conversations with
some of my grow down buddies recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were talking about the setup in
Amsterdam, where they essentially had like
[SPEAKER_01]: these, it was like an ebb and flood style
clone tray where it's like right from
[SPEAKER_01]: clone flipping into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were boiling down the costing per
square foot with the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at it as like a
stacked square foot, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's creative ways to go about
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if you, you bet your plants,
you know, anything longer than three and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half weeks, I'm sure you can get more,
but then, you know, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to account for that in other ways in your
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to have to increase your
demutification capacity, your cooling,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll just be other things that have
to grow with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on under canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Under canopy, I think it's great for,
for a lot of applications, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's a lot of different parts of
the plant that can accept light that can
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit the plant, you know, and a lot of
the lights that are out there now don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get as much penetration through the
canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like certain ones do, you know,
like the, the FosA3 eyes I'm using now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get, you know, upwards of three to
four hair micromoles after a good default
[SPEAKER_01]: down there on those lowers, you know,
I'll get soft balls top to bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, if you don't have something
like that, under canopy would definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: be something advantageous to implement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you typically thin multiple times
throughout flower and through veg,
[SPEAKER_02]: or what's your process for thinning
typically?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for default, I'll do like a light
default and like late veg, and then day
[SPEAKER_01]: 21, between days 21 and 28, we go through,
do a light skirt, pull the lower third
[SPEAKER_01]: off, and then hit about a 60, 65% default
top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get a final default probably,
you know, end of week seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really strip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's not sugar leaf, it goes at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it makes harvesting easier,
all that stuff, and it's not necessary to
[SPEAKER_02]: have those leaves on for a yield at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for, you know, any biomass that
makes it to extraction, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to have, you know,
14% testing trim, the trim is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: test just as high as the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that translates into, you know,
improved costing for everything downstream
[SPEAKER_01]: in our production lab as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to look at it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think, you know, what is your
preferred method for drying and curing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Low and slow, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60, 60, tried and true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know a lot of ops might not have
the real estate to hold things this long,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do low and slow is the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people don't have, I've seen this
a lot where their ACs don't go down to 60,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can only go down to 65 or 62.
[SPEAKER_02]: 62 is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: 65 is pushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to, you don't want to let
perfect get in the way of the good
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have an extra day,
not going to, not going to defeat you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then curing turplocks, you guys use
turplock bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys use 100, like the... We have
the liners in our 37 gallon totes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the Boveda's in there, you know,
just for redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we actually lot things out,
they go under the five pound lot grow
[SPEAKER_01]: bags, turplock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Boveda.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually, that's new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like redundancies though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about redundancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, it's like my life is
built on redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to think about that when you're
planning the operation out too,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if something goes down,
you know, how are we going to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: all these rooms get watered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to have a, you know, female pipe
thread that you can throw an undyed pump
[SPEAKER_01]: on with a couple of 55 gallon drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, your whole fertigation
system goes down, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get support to the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cry cause everything died.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I've seen that happen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen new drums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the power goes out and then it comes
back on and the fans don't kick back on or
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've seen all kinds of stuff in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when our units trips and get stuck in
heating mode, come back in the next day
[SPEAKER_01]: and looks like everything caught fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some golden golden goat,
but it's not the right kind of golden
[SPEAKER_02]: goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely golden plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a field of wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even, not even biomass worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes my stomach churn a little bit
just cause I've seen it before and it
[SPEAKER_02]: just, yeah, I feel for the people that it
happens to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not even touching this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to put some work in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about the first time you started
smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living in South Carolina at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of my friend's older brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't get high the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried it again like a week later and just,
I loved the way it made me feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bit of anxiousness to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of always have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time that I ingest smoke
cannabis, whether it's an edible or
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture, it seems to mitigate that
completely for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was love at second smoke for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a lot of us do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the first time you smoke,
you don't know how to smoke or you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to inhale properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get caught up in everything and
then you don't get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And edibles can fix that real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've been humbled by some boulder
bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been humbled by edibles too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I like raws and gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do too much to edibles these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, for me, they're so strong,
but I can smoke all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when it comes to edibles,
they just, they take, it seems like they
[SPEAKER_02]: take forever to kick in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once they kick in, I want them to be
like more mellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, or I take too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 milligrams is too much for me,
which a lot of people, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm more of like the 20,
it depends too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on what it is and who
made it and time of day, time of day,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm at a concert, I'm not thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if I'm flying and I'm going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my sweet spot is probably right
around 40 to 50 as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got some friends that are like 500
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm not, I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but roll me up a fat joint and we'll
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll smoke two, you know, hanging out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also enjoy the experience of hanging out
with my friends and smoking, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's part of the whole experience
where you can talk to somebody,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can hang out and smoke and you get to
know new people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like over a period of a big joint
in an hour, you can learn a lot about
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody, you know, and there's funny
things that you can tell about people if
[SPEAKER_02]: they gum the joint and get it all wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if, if they make the joint run cause
they hit it too hard, it's like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: little things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like character flaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's about the character flaws
by the way, they smoked the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: True.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't hate on anybody,
but so it's gross to have a joint that's
[SPEAKER_02]: all wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be working on another
book or another version of this book in
[SPEAKER_02]: the near future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, my biggest, the biggest
improvement that I think that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: make, you know, uh, for me, at least is,
uh, the illustrations I spent,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, probably weeks reaching out to
different botanical artists on LinkedIn,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to, you know, try to network and
find folks had a couple artists with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend group, but it just like,
wasn't their, their ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got the guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I got the guys when you're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up going with, uh, I forget the
website, but it's essentially like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of those, uh, like worker B
type websites where you have folks that
[SPEAKER_01]: have different skillsets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go on there like, Hey, I need these
made by this and ended up paying like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 50 bucks in illustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they came out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very practical and it's easy to
tell what we're, you know, depicting with
[SPEAKER_01]: different sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a botanical artist that was
gifted and was passionate about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: could put a whole different spin on the
book and it would change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with technology, it's amazing what
you can do with, with art and with
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporating those types of things in
books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we got a really good layout.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hair lead did the layout in our book
and she's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we had, uh, we had multiple
people do illustrations, which was great
[SPEAKER_02]: because we were on a deadline to get it
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told by somebody, I'm not going to
name any names, but you know who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that there is no way I could get
this book done in a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that lit a fire under my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, there's no way I'm going
to listen to this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do whatever I want and I can get
this book done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got the book done and way less
than a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had my draft and it was done in
independent print.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, it didn't get done as
quickly as I was hoping, but it was done
[SPEAKER_02]: in less than a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take for you to find the
printing company for like the page,
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality, the binding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted to go with the U S company
and yeah, we had to go through,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and see what I knew I wanted on
the cover was I wanted something
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want another girl book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to, they had a big plant with a
black background because everybody had
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I love your book too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing is like, okay,
well it's, it's not just another girl book
[SPEAKER_02]: that has, you know, a beautiful butt on
the cover with a black background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put a seat on the cover of mine and
then I wanted soft touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were like the two things that I knew
that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like thickness.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first printing I did, we got a
smaller run.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a run of 420 and it was a thicker
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was a thicker book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the thickness of the book,
but when it comes to shipping,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had talked to Khalifa genetics and a
couple of other people, uh, and decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: go with a thinner, but it was easier to
flip through the pages and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly, it wasn't, it was still,
it's still a heavy book.
[SPEAKER_02]: It weighs a kilo, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, or 1.75 pounds or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not quite a kilo, but it's heavy,
but for shipping, it's cheaper than
[SPEAKER_02]: something that weighs 2.5 kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went with something thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made more sense for shipping and it's
easier to read.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your book was put, it feels like a
textbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like something I would buy in
college for $300.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah, and I think your book,
what is the retail in your book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's retailing at 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went with like the highest quality
materials for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried out a number of different things,
including Amazon printing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, I really thought Amazon
print on demand was going to be the ticket
[SPEAKER_02]: or, uh, there was a couple other companies
we were looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need name names, but I thought,
man, that was going to be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just pay for it, but they'll give
me a percentage by the each, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: way too expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other reason self-publishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, uh, a lot of times these
publishers will give you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like my book 55, it's a little more
expensive than it probably should be,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I self-published it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to buy smaller runs of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's maybe more expensive than
people think it should be, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: because you had to pay so much more
because you're buying smaller runs and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I didn't want to only make a dollar
a book and probably not make any money for
[SPEAKER_02]: two or three years till the book had paid
for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that's why you, a lot of times
what happens guys when you use publishers
[SPEAKER_02]: is you go to the publisher, they pay for
all the books.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the heavy lifting in that regard
with the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get a royalty on your book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it's a very small
royalty or you might not get any royalty
[SPEAKER_02]: if your book's not good enough to ever pay
for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do it yourself, it's all on
your shoulders.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your book fails, it's your failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the failure failure of somebody
else or their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I, I'm willing to die for my
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't make sense to work with
anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, the book costs to print,
you know, would be more than whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage would have ended up being as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was almost, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you were saying, yeah, you would have
to charge 150 or 175 on Amazon just to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not that there's anything wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might be okay with that,
but it's like, you want something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat affordable to people,
but also you're, you're putting good
[SPEAKER_02]: information out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and yours, yours does work as a coffee
table book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also as a textbook, you know,
I think there's going to, there's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a need for textbooks in colleges on
cannabis, you know, with the way things
[SPEAKER_02]: are going and the amount of jobs that are
out there as far as medical and rec and
[SPEAKER_02]: how many states are legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, there's definitely not a lot
out there like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone's young and they're coming
into the industry, what's the best way for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to get started in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, without any experience at
all, no homegrown experience or any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of relevant transferable skills,
like, uh, you know, working in a kitchen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, uh, either, you know,
try to apply for an entry level job with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with a company that has a good
reputation for having a positive working
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and they, you know, compensate,
take care of their employees fairly and
[SPEAKER_01]: well that route, or alternatively going
in, uh, one of those different programs
[SPEAKER_01]: they offer, you know, Oakster Dam or
Cleveland school cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know both of them work at with placing
individuals that graduate from their
[SPEAKER_01]: courses in positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not able to do it on your
own, working through one of those avenues
[SPEAKER_01]: or channels with one of those businesses
that are very established and have a great
[SPEAKER_01]: network with a lot of different folks will
definitely be able to one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: teach you how to do what you're going to
be doing and also help place you somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can grow your career and go from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's funny because I'm not a big
fan of culinary schools, but I do like
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakster Dam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just taught my first class at Oakster
Dam a month and a half ago or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be doing a breeding
course through Oakster Dam eventually here
[SPEAKER_02]: with the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you taught at Oakster Dam yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Oakster Dam.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would love to have you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I would love to, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can make that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make the connection happen at the
very least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're always looking for good people
and they, they're a bunch of good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're another group of people
that are doing the Lord's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they're really passionate
about the plant and passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: education and finding a way to make the
world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love an introduction, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're local.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're local here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the genetics section
of your book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm a breeder, I do, I work with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your genetic section is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a good overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go into, uh, phenotypes and genotypes
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the genetic section
of your book?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really one of the funnest parts of
the book to write, you know, just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to put a foundation for people to have a
good understanding of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good understanding of why it's so
important, how it came about, what to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, like I said before,
it's the backbone of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: every good successful cannabis cultivation
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, everything's built on
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our slogan is everything has a
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics are so foundational, uh,
to what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it could not only could,
it will make the difference between great
[SPEAKER_02]: and good flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't have good flower and be
successful anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 10 years ago, you could have
mediocre or good flower, and you would
[SPEAKER_02]: still be able to sell it for a good price
and still be able to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas now you're in with the stuff that
nobody wants, that they won't pay a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're competing for price with people
that can produce it for a lot less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and as far as genetics, what are you
looking for in a good cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something, uh, commercially viable,
you know, it's got to check all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes for, uh, you know, not just yield
quality, bag appeal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a growers perspective, is it
something that's easy to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that we have issues with
in the clone room, you know, issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: it anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it pest resistant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, you know, disease and pathogen
free?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, going into commercial viability,
I think commercial viability these days is
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely important, especially with the
business and its scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but as far as like bud structure,
where are you like nested bracts?
[SPEAKER_02]: You like open bracts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a preference on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like to have open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bracks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when you're growing, you know,
thousands of plants in a single room,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to have things too,
too close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't mind tight buds for some
stuff, but I like my buds to have shape at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the day too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like trimming those it's low
leaf to bud ratio is super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think trimming, being able to trim the
weed fast, if you grow it proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as trimming, what do you
guys do for trimming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys use traditional scissors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys doing any advanced stuff,
mechanical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Separation or?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some, uh, some tumblers,
some terminator XL drives, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, certain strains we can push through
and it doesn't look any different from a
[SPEAKER_01]: hand trim flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other things that, uh,
you know, break up a bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those, well, you know,
we'll hand trim those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm a big fan of the can of brush and
finger trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's still, uh, places and
applications that work really well,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though it's not generally used by
everybody, but I think that can of brush
[SPEAKER_02]: and figure trimming is a great way to go
if you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but that's another controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be able to go around 60 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about cloning for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you feel are the best ways to
execute cloning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the important things to watch out
for, uh, you know, starting off with good,
[SPEAKER_01]: robust, vigorously growing healthy mother
plants, you know, obviously having good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics goes without saying, uh,
keeping things as clean as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, starting off with something like
rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that has a good, you know,
oxygen to, uh, water ratio within,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, within the stone wool, uh,
using a good rooting hormone, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining the right light levels,
you know, what do you consider a good root
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the rooting hormone is,
is there ones that you prefer over other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, uh, I use clone X IBA, the endo
three B trach acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all big on clinics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use clinics too, but I do like hormex as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for, for different scenarios,
but if you're trying to get really fast
[SPEAKER_02]: roots, hormex is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clone X is the most consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using them for almost 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grote and Stonewall with clone X great
combo works really well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about domes and humidity and
temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity domes with vents, you know,
typically it'll start hardening off around
[SPEAKER_01]: like day three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go like open them a third,
open a little more each day, start burping
[SPEAKER_01]: whole trays for like 30 minutes or until a
sign of wilt after like day eight should
[SPEAKER_01]: have, uh, you know, fully rooted trays day
14, completely hardened off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature wise, humidity wise,
you want like, you know, 75 80 inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a room that's at least like 65 and
then, uh, temperature, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 77, 78 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We push ours a little warmer and,
but everybody's got their own tech and
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe like, uh, you know,
a hundred, 150 micro moles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to push them too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can get away with a lot less too
and get greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're actually testing,
uh, mats right now, heat mats to see if we
[SPEAKER_02]: can get more roots or faster roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just as my partner believes my TC
partner, Justin, we'll have a future
[SPEAKER_02]: episode where we discuss if the heat mats
actually worked, but, uh, he wants to do
[SPEAKER_02]: trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: He claims that they'll root faster and
they're better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm open to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do side-by-side racks and
really compare cultivar to cultivar,
[SPEAKER_02]: heat mat, no heat mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like some of the things I love
doing with AB testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to always, always be trying on things,
figure out, uh, best practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and never, never rest on your
laurels and expect that what you have is
[SPEAKER_02]: the best that you can ever get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's how we go to these,
these conferences, you know, totally
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many, and especially the size
of MJBiz.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always someone who's got something
new, something innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm looking for a new rolling
machine this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can provide me with a partial hand
roll where we can at least get the shape
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that to speed up the
process, because I really want a
[SPEAKER_02]: hand-rolled joint, but I want to be able
to automate part of the process or speed
[SPEAKER_02]: up the process if we can to where we can
get something quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as, as I've seen so far, there's
nothing that beats a hand-rolled joint
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a hundred percent hand-rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the, uh, the Packers that they
have now, there's always something wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's a small, small amount of them
out of a large batch, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: want to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That won't happen with a good hand roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And consistency is so important,
especially with a product like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going out to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ruin someone's experience if they
get a big old run halfway down their
[SPEAKER_02]: joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the experience I want to share with
the world is like the experience that I
[SPEAKER_02]: get from smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can share that with everybody,
I feel like more people would smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, especially when it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It burns right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the, the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the flavor and the
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then that makes you want to go
back for that experience again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just like if you're cooking a
good meal and it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to come back and they expect to
get a great meal the next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so consistency is just so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistency and repeatability.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
