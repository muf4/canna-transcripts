[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, my guest is Chris Castle from Floor
and Flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris was actually the guest of my show
that never aired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a pilot of the James Loud podcast
in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really what we wanted for
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The context, everything was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff we talked about was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's never going to air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might share it with friends and stuff
like that down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you dragged me away from the
facility from work for a little bit so we
[SPEAKER_01]: could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also filmed the cultivation episode
at your facility before you guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you were live.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just in the first couple of weeks
before you had finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, before our first harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Chris does something really
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, you grow living soil at scale,
which I haven't seen done successfully too
[SPEAKER_00]: much in the recreational world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a very difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we grow vertically on a tiered
system, which makes it even crazier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anyone that's growing,
like you said, living soil in a two-tiered
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite the learning experience,
to put it lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on this project for
about six years full-time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in operation at the facility
since August, and it was all ground-up
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do a real good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was questioning, when I first heard
about you guys were doing double stacked,
[SPEAKER_00]: double stacked in a huge, tall room of
living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these beds have to weigh 1200 pounds
of bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do 1200 on, yeah,
it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 foot long runs, 10 lights on the
bottom, 10 lights on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your rollers roll effortlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use like a bicycle gear type system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Montel Racking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a French-Canadian group,
but fantastic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're doing a no-till living soil,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd call it low-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-till would be not disturbing the soil
or the top soil at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say we are disturbing the top soil,
maybe the first couple inches or few
[SPEAKER_01]: inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd call it low-till, just if you want
to get technical.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and your flower's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gotten better, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done a couple, what, this year on
your second run now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: With finished product or third run,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just harvested our fourth room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each room is getting more dialed in,
just better and better quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison gushers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of poison gushers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the definition of exotic in
terms of its terpene composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tested over around 2.2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just based off of the composition,
would put it in an exotic class.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something you would taste or
smell typically in the California market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of its parents Afghani
times gushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Afghani gives it something really
unique with the sweet profile from the
[SPEAKER_01]: gushers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it checks the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as it checks all the boxes,
actually, in my opinion, it has a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little bit of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has really good color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put it up there with maybe other
unicorn strains because it does check all
[SPEAKER_01]: the boxes that people are looking for in
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest thing is just getting
people to get more familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we kind of get it out there and have
more people try it, I think it'll create a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has that cultivar on the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exclusive to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't seen it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin, yeah, my partner Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now your partner, too, with Tissue
Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think start clean, stay clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his motto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he provides amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes all the difference in terms of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, more vigorous plants, you're going
to get a better yield, just a healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: overall better program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my show, what we're going to do is a
little bit of blind tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have three different products
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one that could be under any one of
these that's a $5 or less gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one that's a $10 or less and one
that's a $15 or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to smoke them blindly
without checking out the packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: without even checking out the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to give me your thought
on what you think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, we'll do a grand
reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I dry hit it first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of bland, not very turpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think it's hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all California weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely think it's hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely think it's hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to make sure it's burning evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the California rec market,
what I've seen is across the board,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's hard to predict what's
what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was usually a giveaway, but not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stuff is super turpy, but it also
burns way cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the thing with the living soil
is the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think that's why you can charge
more for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the fact that it costs more to
produce and it's more of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the effect.
Initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, it'll definitely save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of cost per pound are we
looking at typically with living soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on average?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be able to get it under $400
eventually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of lighting are you guys using?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going with Fluence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're using their Spider 2P's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're about like 635 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tested out probably like seven or
eight different LED companies before we
[SPEAKER_01]: chose Fluence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually going to be doing their
trial runs for their new fixtures too,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really exciting for their 3P's,
I think is what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've noticed with the California
market is three years ago, it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit and like not all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't say that, but even some of the
brands that were like in the black market
[SPEAKER_00]: crushing, they came in the white market
and it sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name names or anything
like that, but it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like even some of the cheaper stuff
is good and some of the top tier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think consistency is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take one more head of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on to the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the lower quality is coming up
even with the cheaper or bigger produced
[SPEAKER_01]: brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I took a visit to one of the
bigger farms in Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they had close to a million square
feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glasshouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not Glasshouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was another group, I can't say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away by their quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, damn, they're producing this
at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's catching up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, granted, a lot of that is being
used for extracts, but still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's scale, but I feel like
there's a certain point at scale that you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot control everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the boutique guys,
you look at this, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gotten bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's scaled up, but there is
definitely a, you know, you've passed that
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold and you cannot control the
quality the same as the guy who has 20
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, the guy who has a hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm seeing guys that,
you know, that have a thousand lights that
[SPEAKER_00]: are producing pretty fucking good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to try to show people,
cause we're at about 8,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy, maybe 8,500, but I want to show
people we can put out consistent quality
[SPEAKER_01]: boutique flower round after round harvest
after harvest.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone's been able to like
really do that consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's 70 days in the life of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You screw up one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like screwing up one year of a life
of, you know, a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think about that first
smoke that we had?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's $5 or less, $10 or less,
or $15 or more?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I try the other two first before,
or do I have to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just let me know what you think and then
you can change it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either a five or $10 gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you my final answer at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your final, final, final, final.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember the old hemp wicks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use a lighter to light the hemp
wick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I used to be big on those
thinking I was getting more flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then I, a buddy of mine, he told me,
he was like, well, you got to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: no one's actually testing the hemp wick
for like any kind of like chemicals or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you might as well be smoking
some butane and whatever, a few parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million, then not knowing what you're
actually smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about the drama with
Josh and Ra right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard about any of that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just don't even have time to
like read into that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so like this literally in the weeds
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going crazy over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people calling in sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, you're not just growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have to worry about like right now,
network issues, mechanical equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, managing people, people calling
out sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, it's endless,
but it's a great learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm grateful that I get to do this
every day for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think times are tough all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's great to be able to have a job,
be able to do what we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you look back at your 18 year
old self, would your 18 year old self be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy with you or be like, Oh,
I thought you were going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was super into cannabis even at 18,
19.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I really started like getting
into cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually growing some, you know,
maybe like five or six lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing some tangerine dream, driving it
down to Santa Monica, selling it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some Arminians at the dispensary
for like four or five grand a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I like really fell in love
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I definitely didn't think I'd be doing
this, but it was definitely a dream of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, it's, it's crazy that life
has come back full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, what year was the first year you
smoked?
[SPEAKER_01]: This already went out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is the $5 gram right here,
or maybe it's the 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tricked this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, it's all lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's burning a little black too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, we didn't get an oil
ring off it, but it did burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil ring could just be the tightness of
the joint too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like a good oil ring on my joints
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how black this is though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, and this was white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That burned white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That burned pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it wasn't smooth, but it burned
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely wasn't smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a little, initially you got a lot
of turps, but then the turps kind of faded
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most strains don't do good in a joint
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think most growers don't grow good
wheat to make it taste good all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think, did you hear that guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that has a lot to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely truth to that,
but I think that a lot of guys don't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing with, so for
instance, for breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you talk about guys that are
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the hardest part about breeding is not
making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing the selections, being able to
grow the wheat good enough so you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people are missing
out on that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's some guys doing it
really good, but a lot of guys are just
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds and it's like making seeds as
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's not really breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is doing the selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it was just up North at house of
Colts far going through some selections
[SPEAKER_00]: that they got up there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some crazy stuff, some news of,
yeah, some of the stuff I made with Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you're making some crazy stuff
like, like the seeds we pop for the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's gonna be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's hyped off of those $20,000
grand prize June 1st, uh, $10,000 dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: goes to charity and then $10,000 goes in
your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the charity aspect, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're, our industry should be
more about community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I feel like doing the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already doing the right thing by
growing weed in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that cannabis is
something that should be shared with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think making seeds, you're putting
out amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's, it's a positive
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis is a positive action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something good for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did go out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think the five, the less than 10 or
the more than 15?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the industry is so deceiving,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a $15 gram, you know,
and we don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My opinion, that should be the $5 gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that tasted like, it just tasted
like wheat, like not even weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like wet weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did taste a little wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it also was super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there is, you know, like as far
as like testing and moisture content,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be an issue with compliance and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, should we get onto the last one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to try some of yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to smoke some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to, and it was some good stuff,
but I feel like we won't be high enough
[SPEAKER_00]: from these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to redeem ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke cigars also?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke tobacco either, but I do
like the occasional cigar, but I won't do
[SPEAKER_00]: blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even though that's cigar,
but it's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do blunt growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone smoked blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the easiest thing to roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends died from esophageal
cancer about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he got diagnosed was like when I
quit smoking cigarettes completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I didn't smoke a lot of
cigarettes, but socially I would smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette here or there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have a drink, which I'm
trying not to drink now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be 10 days tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to Spain though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how that holds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's saying, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to drink in Spain,
but I really don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't plan on drinking in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like gin and tonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, the food's going to be fantastic
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food is epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food is absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of my favorite places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going with Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some friends over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: People I get to only see once a year
sometimes, you know, and everybody from
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world that likes a good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of them are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real connoisseurs, real aficionados.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went last year too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go with you guys next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had booths there several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be in the greenhouse booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a table set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing my own booth this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arian from greenhouse invited me to be in
his booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be slanging seeds out of his
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my new drop with all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, you know, the Sauer diesel,
which is the Skittles back cross times the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sauer diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Weasels diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the cross that you did for the
contest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's Zerios, which is cereal milk
times Zerbert times the ZBX, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the original Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're all fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Skittles, but it's got to be all
Skittles, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That diet Skittles stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk a lot about the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have something complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moonbow, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, from Archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a juice box from Loud Cannogenics,
which I'm part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Juice box is Skittles times the Lotto 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's the rain shadow runts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fucking rain shadow runts of
the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an award winning strain too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Skittles times G41.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so what's your opinion on
gas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it making a comeback?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got some fire Goji Oji.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's, or not Goji.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Pinosol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Goji Oji Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad you called it gas because
some people get gas confused with fire or
[SPEAKER_01]: Zaza weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas is just the profile for Oji.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we have the Pinosol from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't smell like your typical Oji Fino.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the jungle cake, which is the
Wi-Fi times wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super strong, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked that shit and it fucking... Yeah,
that's some good stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is your take on the third one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That tastes probably... The first one
might have been the Terpiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one doesn't burn as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't burn as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't super chirpy, but it wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say 15, 5, and 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 5, and 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 5, and 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one... Move this joint to the
back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delighted.
Delighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a less than 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 5 or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Terpiest one was... Who would have
thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're small, but they smoke really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the 5?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the harshest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backpack boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This backpack boys is a Chocolato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little harsh and burned a
little... It was a little harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was Alien Cookies Times
Cushmints, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the Delighted was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Alien Cookies Times Cushmints.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was Terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I mean, maybe it could be
grown a little bit better, but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: price, it's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last one... You've heard of
Preferred Gardens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferred Solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferred Crushed It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean... Was that... That was their
indoor or green house?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's 33% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any outdoor.
Green house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop in numbers like that, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it looks like indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like indoor flower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't super Terpy, but yeah,
it wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was smooth, it didn't burn like
the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who would have thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Backpack boys, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think...
[SPEAKER_00]: What Terps did you taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you taste any on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, none.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't taste any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't like it
had bad flavor, but it just didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: like...
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're fucking spoiled in
California and like we're weed stopped,
[SPEAKER_00]: so... Yeah, it's got to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got to taste good if you fired the
Roach up the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my, you know... If I can smoke it a
week later and it still tastes like good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have something for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll do the trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, is that Poison Gushers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Poison Gushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hand rolled from Professional
Joint Roller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does some super, super, super great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got our logo on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's his name, by the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris is going to come on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to him, getting him on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He rolls some bigger joints as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're actual joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like big crutches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very California style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes good all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the special lighter
after this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my torch lighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a cigar smoker for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's appropriate if you want to light
the joint evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a member of this club called
Wing Tip in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a cigar club?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a cigar lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so they get a cigar lounge,
they have like some of the best food in
[SPEAKER_00]: the city and during COVID, they were one
of the only places it was open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was open for business and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a wine bar and a really good
bar, but good food, really good food,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good staff, the people there are
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as like they have a
smoking lounge, smoking jackets and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you smoke weed there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not supposed to smoke weed
there, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not surprised you're a member
of like a swanky club like that with you
[SPEAKER_01]: being a former chef and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are you friends with like the
owners or like?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a social club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during COVID, the reason I was a member
was you couldn't go out to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They closed all these restaurants and I
like good food and my friends like good
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up going there several times a
week at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't want to cook for everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, we did that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say that, you know,
from not working in the restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: industry anymore, I definitely got my
fixed during COVID because we always had
[SPEAKER_00]: parties at our houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our friends had parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick more Wagyu with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you get the Wagyu from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pursuit Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eric from Pursuit Farms, amazing dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I introduced him to one of my
friends and he's growing these amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: pigs and they're feeding out hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's brewing up beer right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to freaking feed the beer to
him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese style.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how's that smoking so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is a 20 and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guessing 20 and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke this one all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How smooth is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what kind of papers he's
using?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it'd be a good question to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the pattern on these papers too,
but you got a nice oil ring on yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but also that's credit to how it's
rolled too, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even use the coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to smell coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The California market is pretty
interesting in the sense that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: frigging in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where it's going to be in 10
years, 20 years, 30 years or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to compare it to alcohol all the
time and I think there is some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons to Prohibition and the end of
Prohibition and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's similarities, but it's a different
beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely different, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, which there's more varieties of
cannabis than any other cultivated species
[SPEAKER_00]: of anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says one thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty impressive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, like you said, we're just in
its infancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, we have a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think anyone that tries to predict
anything about the future of our industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in California or our country,
they just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your, you think they're going to
get rid of traditional HPS and make
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone go LED?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they already do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, but do you think that's going to
really hold up and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess it'll be, what's your
opinion on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I think it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're using LED too though,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're using the Fluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hard not to use LED just
because of the cost of running anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing anything at scale,
the cost of power, but also I think people
[SPEAKER_01]: that haven't made the switch, they're just
a little stuck in their ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the technology has caught up and
you're clearly able to get quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm already, you're not even using
adjustable spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the adjustable spectrum,
you can mimic an HPS light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, I mean, to a degree, it'll mimic
the spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say it's something almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a degree, but I think spectrum change,
we're not there yet because there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: companies like science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they went out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were big on spectrum change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not quite there yet with the
formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried those lights out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with Fluence, it's a white broad
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from propagation all the way to
flowering, you don't have to change
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually better for the plant,
especially with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do find with certain cultivars,
they just don't like LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be due to the breeding,
just the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just like some cultivars
perform better under a HPS and some
[SPEAKER_00]: perform better under a CMH and LED is the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream I think does really well under
traditional HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, yeah, we used to go,
I just freaking flourished.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes sense, you know,
because there were no LEDs back then when
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream was out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I think a couple of my
friends have done like CMH versus HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, especially in that
spectrum, some stuff does way better under
[SPEAKER_00]: the CMH.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turquoise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's interesting how far we've
come, but still how far the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: really has to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in 10, 15, 20 years, if it's
federally legal, like everything's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be ran like a food facility or a
medical grade facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like what you're doing here with
the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're running like a real laboratory.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the government's going to get
involved on a federal level and it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to change things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once they learn more, we educate
them more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They learn from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like people from the state,
you know, they don't, they don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have to kind of educate them as
far as what, what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like FDA, ABC, all these
federal entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, it's, it's really
interesting as far as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could go in multiple different
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, hopefully the quality be going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's one thing I've seen over
the last, but then it plateaus,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it plateaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a lot of guys that grow
Rockwell and I think Rockwell's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some people crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I see a lot of
mediocre Rockwell and then cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see amazing, absolutely amazing cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil for the most part, the guys who
have the balls to grow soil indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a lot of fucking risk
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are scared to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, especially if you're already
being, you know, you're successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been growing in cocoa forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you switch to soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just, I don't blame them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's, it's probably the biggest
learning curve to make that switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the hardest media to grow in
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has the most buffer though,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, if you recognize what's going on
with the plant, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, you have a much bigger buffer
than you do with Rockwell or with cocoa to
[SPEAKER_00]: where identifying problems, you know,
they could be nutrient related,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, you know, you're talking about
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bigger buffer, but I think just more
issues to deal with, especially indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's harder to hit certain metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're trying to hit yield,
I think also it's hard for people to get
[SPEAKER_01]: density out of their flower too,
in living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like living soil though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way it smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel after smoking that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel high, but I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's definitely like a clean,
clean high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's across the board for the most
part, it's usually a cleaner version of
[SPEAKER_00]: the high you get from stuff that was grown
in cocoa or Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that those are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking whatever else, if it's
Skittles or if it's fucking OG and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smoke pretty good, you know,
as far as sour diesel back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But soil, living soil, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be wild, but I don't know if that
makes sense to grow that commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it takes so much longer for one
thing and problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the length of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't like growing 12 weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't afford to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just need a bigger facility.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And money to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have the original super silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything you guys are growing,
that whole tester room, this stuff looks
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eye candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animal cookies looks ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't even look like animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are huge nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super excited to bring that back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from Sirius in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's since passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in peace, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a t-shirt from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny cause he gave me a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just in the parking lot at a high
times cannabis cup and maybe 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, maybe it was even earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was 2010 or 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was in 2010 in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds about right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the, those cups changed from
back in the day, you know, even Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to the U S and how they went from 2012
to, uh, the they've had, they haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: one in a while, but the last one that they
had and the last ones that they've had for
[SPEAKER_00]: a little while, uh, it's like disco.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old ones were like the classic disco
and once disco is gone, it's gone forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you can try to do it,
it's just not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does our animal cookies, does it,
do you remember what animal cookies looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the buds, the buds look bigger and it
could be the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never seen animal cookies other than
in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw it growing on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think the smell of it is
pretty freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has that, that almost a
doughy kind of fucking cookie smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unique for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's like, I look, cookies are
such a pain in the ass to grow back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, coming from tissue culture,
it's, it's making it look easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just a test to tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this again sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck on the contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Yeah.
