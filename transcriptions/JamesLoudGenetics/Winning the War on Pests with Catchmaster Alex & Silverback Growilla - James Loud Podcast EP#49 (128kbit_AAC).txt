[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, our special guest is
Catchmaster Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, thank you so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've actually been wanting to come
on your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a fan, been checking it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had some mutual friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Josh Freeman, Silverback Freeman.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the one who connected us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go 20 years back, more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years back with him and you as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were running around the same circle
and just different sides of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably even were in the same room at
one point, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we both like Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sour D.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually I think that's how I met
Josh really is I want to say initially was
[SPEAKER_05]: picking up sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then and then when he he was out,
he needed more sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and I was growing more sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I ended up supplying him sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really actually for me,
it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we wouldn't say it right then,
but it was chem dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, it was getting the chem,
the chem 91s, chem fours.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're calling it chem dog, even though
it's sour, calling it sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were sour passing is kind of
how I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be honest, you know, with Josh,
let him know what's up and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, as long as they had the
good notes, that was all it was all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to grow the best sour that I
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: His outs and his depths of sour were
sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sticky, sticky buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just don't see stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that debt passes indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he sold it for more than indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I paid more for his outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even knowing it was depth, you're like,
you just had to have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't care because it was so loud and
you open the bag up, it would hit you in
[SPEAKER_04]: the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's up for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed those days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially Sonoma, Casadero, Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then, they were just, it was at its
peak, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not that they're not peaking now in
their own ways, but like back then,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the cannabis scene really peaked up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sebastopol.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I was at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Occidental, Sebastopol, Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those places.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was great flower going around late
90s, early 2000s, even before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, man, the flower was great back
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you get your start in the industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I grew up in the subculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of just part of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you kind of have no choice but
to be in it almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt like it at the moment,
just because it's like a big part of like
[SPEAKER_05]: your circle and my dad grew.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just all around cannabis all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I've kind of had, kind of went
more towards like my natural abilities was
[SPEAKER_05]: like sales, you know, and just combining
like my love for cannabis and like my
[SPEAKER_05]: community and having access, I think is
probably a big reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think probably the number one reason why
I got into it is just like you were
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, some of the best cannabis,
I think, especially back then that anyone
[SPEAKER_05]: had ever seen, you know, in the world or
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously there's some stuff that's
comparable in the world, but coming out of
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendocino, Humboldt, obviously there's a
lot of Humboldt roots, the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it just goes on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Emerald Triangle, Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just right place, right time,
I guess is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were blessed to be in that place at
that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I mean, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's to say I'm 40 years old and to say
I've been in it for 20 years is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 47.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're 47.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 47.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's not a lot of
professions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be this age and say you've been in
it that long, you know, just to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about our 18 year old selves a lot
of the show, like, you know, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: there's only two people that you really
want to impress.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your 18 year old self and your 80
year old self.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think most of the people in this
industry, you know, their 18 year old
[SPEAKER_04]: selves will be pretty stuffed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know, I know my 18 year old self
would be like, right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty magical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I owe a lot to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's brought a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had some hard times, you know,
and the transitions and trials and
[SPEAKER_05]: tribulations that I think pretty much
everyone has gone through, especially if
[SPEAKER_05]: they've been in it for the last couple of
decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wouldn't trade it for the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've done all kinds of stuff in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, besides the products you have now,
you used to work with Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a funny story how I got into
all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, I was growing and I got turned on
to Botanicare's like Pro-Gro, Pro-Bloom,
[SPEAKER_05]: Liquid Karma recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the Cal Mag, of course, Cal Mag was
an everything, you know, and I was just
[SPEAKER_05]: rocking that recipe that was passed down
to me from someone older than me,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were picking it up from Hydro Depot
was, I think, was one of the connects,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and there's of course Marin
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those two connects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: People started liking my results,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're asking me what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So naturally, I mean, this is,
I wasn't working for Botanicare,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I was working for Botanicare on
accident because what I was doing is I was
[SPEAKER_05]: getting everyone turned on to their
recipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were pushing the ECI and like the
PPMs high on that stuff because,
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it just worked, you know,
we were, especially with Sour,
[SPEAKER_05]: we were able to push it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, get that yield up and get
that nose up and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was, I started actually,
let's see here, I moved to another spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had six grow ops actually back then.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were all partnerships kind of
deals, the medical era stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the spots was next to Santa
Rosa Hydro's new little, they had a little
[SPEAKER_05]: shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they didn't have the big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a little one that's now owned by
Grow Generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so I was a regular there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they really started stocking a
whole bunch of Botanicare product because
[SPEAKER_05]: of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm going there and I'm, I need five
gallons of this and five gallons of that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, over and over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I need a, you know, do you guys
got the 30 gallon drums?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and they're like, who is this
guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then, so then I actually started
helping them hire and train there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's kind of got started in the
industry a little bit there at Santa Rosa
[SPEAKER_05]: Hydro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped them find some people,
train some of their staff, helped with the
[SPEAKER_05]: purchasing, like letting them know,
Hey, you need these supplements.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need these, you know, these additives.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is how, you know,
this is ready grow cocoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is how cocoa works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause not a lot of people were rocking it
as strong back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated cocoa back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you have the blocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put them in a kiddie pool and that's
why ready grow was like kind of a big
[SPEAKER_05]: thing back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from Botanicare, obviously
there's a lot of other companies that make
[SPEAKER_05]: just as good or better products than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at that time it was revolutionary to
have something pre-mixed and ready to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff, but it still required a lot of
CalMac, you know, which was really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really beneficial for Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, long story short,
I'll try on that side is that I,
[SPEAKER_05]: they finally got opened up a bigger
facility, you know, and I was rolling
[SPEAKER_05]: through with carts and Treg, the founder
of Botanicare was there at the shop and he
[SPEAKER_05]: had never seen such a large array of their
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, usually when they go in the
shops, it's just the heavy hitters.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was getting really into the nitty
gritty, all their cool little supplements
[SPEAKER_05]: they had, you know, C-Plex and organic
hairline and all these things,
[SPEAKER_05]: humic and fulvex and kind of messing with
those different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they saw it, it looked really nice
and it was really stocked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they saw me rolling through with
the big carts.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's all get that guy's number,
you know, I'm going to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Initially, I didn't want to stop growing
really.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't, you know, I didn't have time
and I was making good, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making good, let's just say with
growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they asked me to work for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But instead what I did is I did some
development beta testing with them and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually helped create a three-part
nutrient system that we had.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like eight bottles come in all
white label and we broke them all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: down to just three parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Kind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a three-part nutrient system.
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal was, the goal was to not have,
to not require CalMac.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think about it, this like
Botanicare's most famous product that's
[SPEAKER_05]: literally used with GH, it's used with
advanced nutrients at that time,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially was their CalMac.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Botanicare's CalMac.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then he's like, well, you know what I'm
going to do is I'm going to make a
[SPEAKER_05]: three-part that doesn't require CalMac.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of, it's a very, very
creative idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Growilla was sold to Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that before or after?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I brokered that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the one who brokered it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had my indoor ops and then I had the
deps and the outdoors, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and all those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those, uh, Josh, Josh really turned me
on to the top dress and all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_05]: great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just, uh, if you need to leave and
you got, you're relying on somebody that
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell them, okay, look, you lay it all
down and just water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd scratch it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, everyone's now doing no-till and
stuff, but yeah, low-till, no-till.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, you know, there was some,
we had meetings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a lot of R and D for Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we did, we were developing,
um, a Baker's rack tray at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think right around that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, we were making a blend called
slacker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't quite take off, but it was like a
soil blend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were, they were talking about a lot
of organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just kind of brought it up in one of
those brainstorming meetings at Botanicare
[SPEAKER_05]: in Arizona, by the way, because I have to
go to Arizona once a month for those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, then, um, they're like,
well, tell me more about this Grow Willow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we kind of went back and forth and I
connected, connected them together and
[SPEAKER_05]: brokered that, that deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now technically, uh, uh, Scott's
Miracle Grow, one of the largest companies
[SPEAKER_05]: in the growers market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Growers industry owns our buddy Josh's
product that he created.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's amazing how that, how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Josh did all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roots in Harmony.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I mean, his, his, we were just
talking about our last guest, Kyle was
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about his, uh, his mix tapes being
the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a DJ and Josh had calendars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember his calendar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually hung his calendars up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any of those still?
[SPEAKER_04]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a briefcase full of
calendars, high times bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to bring back the Roots in Harmony
calendars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I literally have the one with like
with Cushage in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he used to grow Cushage and Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's also the guy who brought the
Durban down from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went and bought the Sense of Sea Pack
of Durban and then made the Ripple Plum
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Raspberry Cheesecake and a bunch
of Sour Diesel times Durban.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I had, I had my hands on some
Durban for a year and a half ago and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was growing it and picking it up and
moving it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause his Durban is different than the
Durban I see from everybody else pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if his Durban is the real Durban,
I've seen it for a handful of times,
[SPEAKER_04]: but most of the Durban that's going around
is very like super silver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I haven't even honestly seen what
I know is Durban for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've seen Durban from people and
I'm like, Hey, that's more like super
[SPEAKER_04]: silver haze than like Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause Durban is really musky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really musky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hits hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll, it'll kick you in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes, it takes long to grow too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you, if you push it,
you know, but I mean, you get monster,
[SPEAKER_04]: monster cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The trade off is yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks awesome indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also kind of hairy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember it being a little dark too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the different bag of pill things that
happened over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I remember going from,
uh, you want it to be bright and limey,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, to purple and then, then not
purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you couldn't sell purple to save your
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was super unpopular.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple Oracle GDP days and all of a
sudden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there was purple Oracle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was like a good Mendo perps and
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one day nobody wanted purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't sell it to save your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, you, you got to go to
Richmond to sell purple or wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there was a couple of places you
could probably still move it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely didn't want it in LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bay area was very picky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think OG and sour pretty much took
over right, right then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was all, everyone wanted OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a theory about that, about the OG
and sour popularity thing is it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: different than what we're dealing with now
is that it was actually really hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually hard to get it to come out
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and that, if you got really good
OG or really good sour, like good,
[SPEAKER_05]: strong nose, you know, it's, it's full
potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were the shit and you had the shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not everybody could do
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that, that had some play in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I don't honestly think that they
perform as well under LEDs as they do
[SPEAKER_04]: perform under HPS or CMH or a combination
of the two.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my two cents.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard from, you know, Brian and
Vital, some of the stuff, those guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, the CMH is the ticket I've heard
from some people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like HPS still.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like HPS flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like smoking HPS.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong with LED.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it works for a lot, especially the
purple stuff, candy stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it works well for that,
but you know, it's just, it's a personal
[SPEAKER_04]: preference too, but I don't see a lot of
good OG now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we don't really see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is, it is hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best OG I've seen to this day has
always been light depth or been light,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, growing, not full outdoor,
but like, you know, full sun depth,
[SPEAKER_05]: not light assist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I see some good doc OG coming from
humble still.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's some good doc OG packs that
I've seen that are, you know, from their
[SPEAKER_05]: friends grow that are like, on that,
on that, on that point though,
[SPEAKER_05]: really it's chem 91 that I liked the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, in that realm, it's the most
nostalgic for me, it's the most nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's subtle, but it is like burnt
tires.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like chem 91 has that burnt tire appeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you love it, you love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's anti-candy really almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's totally anti-candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like GMO or chem D because
GMO comes from chem D and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, it has that burnt tire still,
but it's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just subtle, subtly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the chem 91 was different than OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG is very like earthy and piney and
citrusy and chem 91, it has earthiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, you know, I wouldn't say it's
necessarily really citrusy, even though
[SPEAKER_04]: there's citrus in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, it's pungent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to see, learn more, see,
see more come out about the, the turps on
[SPEAKER_05]: the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're coming back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, yeah, they're, they're making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really like about, you know,
the right ones, you know, but we'll see,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's, there's some arguments
sometimes about that over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people say they're, you know,
they're OG, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the OG, you know, or they're sours,
the sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's always been, that's always
been since the beginning of those,
[SPEAKER_04]: even early on early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been a lot of like,
it's whatever New York wanted really is
[SPEAKER_05]: what ended up being there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that gas, there's something
special about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, gas has taken on its own
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had like the GMOs and then the Donnie
burgers and, you know, then they've
[SPEAKER_04]: evolved into the double burger or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, and those, those wash really
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, and, but that's still not M
91.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people, when they,
you know, especially the younger
[SPEAKER_04]: generation, they relate to gas more of
like that GMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, gorilla, gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another one that took over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought gorilla glue up from the cup in
LA in 2000.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That changed pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2013 though, it won the cup there and they
gave out clones to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the smartest move.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the exact opposite of whatever we
thought we were supposed to be doing with
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, it actually promoted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It promoted it blew up and it needed to
share it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needed to get around.
[SPEAKER_05]: People needed to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, they so freely gave it to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just whales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, actually the first time I was
introduced to it was in actually at going
[SPEAKER_05]: to botanical meetings from Doug Martin,
you know, Doug Marvin at all in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually gave me, he actually brought,
we kind of, we would all, we would do that
[SPEAKER_05]: because we came from all different spots,
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do our botanical meeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all brought our buds, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had, he had his nice gorilla glue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when Josh was over from sour
to, to glue.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it, I mean, he's the gorilla.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was in high demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: The silver silverback gorilla.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then his hair turned gray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I remember I gave cuts to him and
my friend Joe and a couple other people
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'd got from the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was that your other people too,
cause they gave them out so freely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It went from everybody growing sour to
everybody growing gorilla glue within one
[SPEAKER_04]: season, because it finished faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: It New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: That reminds me of something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blackberry Kush is a similar phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, you know, it was like that,
that no matter what, it looked good.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked so good and outdoor had
performed well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was low THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you could depth it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would, it would look like indoor for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like straight indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably today, you probably still
most people couldn't tell.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually ran that and did pretty well
with Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know the Terps, but it was
just never like a strong, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what everyone complained.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they called it like, like fool's
gold or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people were complaining about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's now there's different,
you know, philosophies on, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of different kinds of feelings,
you know, cannabis should give you and all
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it's something that could get,
come back around again, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and people, I think for flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's been bred into life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I, I, I crossed it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm not going
to come on here and say I'm a breeder,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, officially, but I've,
I've played around like a hobby,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and I've crossed it with sour
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: My book is basically all about that for
hobbyists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ordered, I ordered, I ordered a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I reposted your, your reel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an adventure writing the book,
but yeah, it's, it's for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, it's great being able to
put all the information, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Greg Green did it 25 years ago,
but there hasn't been anything since
[SPEAKER_04]: really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy to put a book on the market
that I think is a great, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: resource for information about breeding
for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think everybody should breed
honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a good grower, you should breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not a good girl, you should
learn how to grow better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, cause the
phenohunting is where you actually see the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't grow them well enough to
have them express, it's really hard saying
[SPEAKER_04]: this one's better than this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's better than this one and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you line them up 10 at a time and
you're not growing them well, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, and I still find people that out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I travel to the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do, I do speaking gigs and stuff for
conventions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you meet a lot of people
that are just getting into it all and they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't understand or realize the,
some of the complexities there are in
[SPEAKER_05]: phenohunting and, and keeping track of
those and making sure that you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you, you keep the ones that you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, taking it all the way to
flower just to find out which one is good
[SPEAKER_05]: and which one's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of, there's a lot
involved for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of respect for people who are
in it, like, like yourself, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is, is like the amount of
genetic diversity varies from one plant to
[SPEAKER_04]: the next.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you have something like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make it S one a blue dream and you
basically get four expressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have the real Santa Cruz blue dream
cut, but then you take something like
[SPEAKER_04]: gelato 33 and you pop seeds and every
single expression is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where, where you, you see the
flower of it, the way they grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so much diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then on the same note, you have
something like gelato 41 and it has a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more stability than the 33.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that came from, you know, like I said,
it gives it a lot of commercial viability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it has and blue dream is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of people that hate
on it for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that goes ties into that
thing I was telling you about like OG and
[SPEAKER_05]: sour being kind of hard and where blue
dream was easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So blue dream kind of got ripped on,
you know, it's not that it was bad,
[SPEAKER_05]: bad weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the high, the effect,
some people want that like strong narcotic
[SPEAKER_04]: effect and other people want that
uplifting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some people want like through the
roof Durbin that, you know, most people
[SPEAKER_04]: can't handle cause their heart beats too
fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are different types of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people have different, uh,
react differently to absolutely we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our body chemistries are all so different
that it affects us different and then
[SPEAKER_04]: taste and flavor is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's true with wine too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, I see that with wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you got the, they got the
smellier.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, you know, putting all the
hints in your, in your ear about what,
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're tasting and sure enough,
it starts appearing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden you're like butter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I taste the butter and the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, same thing with cigars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cigars is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like, and after getting a bunch of
data points, you realize what's what and
[SPEAKER_04]: cigar, but cigars are so strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you're looking for the subtleties and
the subtleties are there, but you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: experience enough, just like with
cannabis, I think the average person looks
[SPEAKER_04]: at weed and they're like, Oh, that's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after you've tried 50 different things
or a hundred different things or a
[SPEAKER_04]: thousand different things, you have a real
different opinion of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that goes along with growing
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's as basic or as complex as you
want to make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all, they're very, there's a lot
of, uh, parallels with, uh, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, cannabis and, uh, wine, you know,
alcohol in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I, I think tobacco is one of
those things that gets kind of overlooked
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously there's the cigar
industry, but like, you know, the tobacco
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and all that actually grow tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have, I have, I have seeds and,
uh, some, some crosses and stuff when I
[SPEAKER_05]: grow it at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, there's little tobacco buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've seen it in full
growth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take that out of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just mean on my own little home grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not promoting a tobacco brand right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or growing home tobacco.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it's, it is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the leaves get all fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a cool little like almost like
trichome looking things all over the buds
[SPEAKER_05]: and the leaves and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tobacco is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I know I have, you know,
I think it's sacred that you can have a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot more respect for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been kind of bastardized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we're talking about lung
cancer and other things, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: they've proven that tobacco can cause lung
cancer with cigarettes, but like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from a sacred and medicinal
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess in some cases as a, as a pest
control thing too, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, it's interesting because I can't
stand the smell of like regular
[SPEAKER_04]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to smoke cigarettes a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't smoke cigarettes either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I just home grow a little
leaf or, you know, roll blunt or something
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our mutual friend, Josh, he's,
he smokes a spliffs.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of my friends smoke spliffs,
but these guys used to bong rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about that a little
earlier about mixing it with a weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: then taking bong ribs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would grind it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I fell into that for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's kind of like a whippet almost
are like, you're kind of, you're like
[SPEAKER_05]: Zorbin kind of like people would say you
Zorb on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would take those quick little mini
plastic bongs, you know, just hit it real
[SPEAKER_05]: quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd take, you'd take like a,
she would grind up almost a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: cigarette in with a whole bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and grind it in real fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she could smack the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Snap it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Snap it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call them, they call them smoke snaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call them mixed rips.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixed rips is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one time I actually took one of
those while sitting on a balcony thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: like edge, you know, on a, at an
apartment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost fell over and fell off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet those will get you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got pretty sick on them a couple of
times too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was enough for me to stop doing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, uh, I mean, that was years
ago, many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a guy named Paul check.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Paul check uses the volcano and he
vaporizes tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he vaporizes other stuff too,
but he vaporizes tobacco for
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he does a lot of writing and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he's one of the people I look up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I still respect these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get, they get kind of blown out of
proportion or bastardized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, you know, like you're saying
like, yeah, but in our natural form,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and it can be used responsibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, you're talking
about something where there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a vaporizing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's probably a safer and
smarter way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it helps with concentration,
he's a great writer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also, you know, um, he does sports
medicine and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did hear you mention, uh, Brian quick,
uh, briefly in there, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: from vital garden supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got this hat right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a couple of the, his hats at my
house too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked, I actually worked with vital
garden supply for a little bit in between
[SPEAKER_05]: Royal gold and, um, Royal gold and what
I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went from botanic care to Royal gold to,
uh, vital to what I'm doing now,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is catch master.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's dive into catch master.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause, uh, your name is catch master Alex
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've taken a lot of ownership over this
project.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, it's a bigger company than
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of, uh, initially a lot of
people, I think they go, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that is my company, you know, but that's
the, that's the way I, I take pride in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I carry in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when these guys approached me and they
came to me and, um, were presented the
[SPEAKER_05]: idea of bringing them into the growers
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were actually called Atlantic pasting
glue company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have, they do have a brand called
catch master.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, um, for the professional pest pest
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, they primarily made like,
uh, like rat glue traps and they made,
[SPEAKER_05]: they made the yellow sticky traps and all
those kinds of things, but they never
[SPEAKER_05]: really put any hyper-focus on the growers
industry and the growers market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a lot of, uh, they work,
you know, work with some pretty big
[SPEAKER_05]: companies like terminix and Oregon and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and they're American, American
company, family owned company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, initially they're kind of pitching it
to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, no, no, I'm like,
cause I'm a nutrient fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, guy, you know, like all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, uh, the, the growers world,
you know, almost never really thought
[SPEAKER_05]: twice about the sticky trap, you know,
the sticker trap is like, but it's in
[SPEAKER_05]: every grow room and it's always been
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really started breaking down to
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, like how, what their perspective on
it is like the professional way of
[SPEAKER_05]: utilizing them as pest monitors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We always call them pest traps,
you know, and people are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: haphazardly hanging them in the grow rooms
and then they're just spraying,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of growers for a
long time that just kind of saw shit and
[SPEAKER_05]: they sprayed, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then they put the traps up to
control gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of been the MO for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was all honestly, that was my,
my interpretation of what a sticky trap
[SPEAKER_05]: was for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just soil gnats, soil gnats.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they started breaking down
the science of it and all that,
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, you know, I started studying,
uh, you know, I'm working on my degree
[SPEAKER_05]: right now in sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm, I'm taking a lot of,
it's really, really got me going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got me kind of more excited because
it's something outside of what I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing all these years, which is like,
like I said, soil and fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, focusing on integrated pest
management, understanding the complexities
[SPEAKER_05]: of it has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually, I created catch master
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've been the front of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the head of that entire thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a market segment manager essentially
created the, uh, help create the brand,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, where's the team, we have a team
with the website, of course, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, new products, developing new products
and, um, really getting the message out
[SPEAKER_05]: there doing, um, a hit in the road and all
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, before that, um, there really wasn't
a, you know, there wasn't a clear,
[SPEAKER_05]: concise message about like how to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at first I was like, like, there's no
way I'm going to go down this path.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm going to work on three years
now, uh, working with these guys and on
[SPEAKER_05]: this project.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, the sky's the limit for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, I see so much more improvement
for integrated pest management and
[SPEAKER_05]: protocols for cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people who have their SOPs and
other protocols.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go around telling people
to change their SOPs necessarily,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's just a few little tweaks and
features.
[SPEAKER_05]: A few things that the professionals,
like the people who never stepped up,
[SPEAKER_05]: stepped a foot in the, in a cannabis
facility ever, you know, they don't,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of them won't even service cannabis
facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these are federally,
federally based companies, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I got to have a lot of their
information, a lot of their knowledge,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that you cause I think,
I think the biggest thing right now for
[SPEAKER_05]: that side of things is having a dedicated
IPM manager is kind of a, you have,
[SPEAKER_05]: or you have a person who, um, that also,
uh, you know, does the cleaning of the,
[SPEAKER_05]: of the plants and then cleaning the room,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have them also do a good checking of
the pest monitors, having the pest traps
[SPEAKER_05]: up, actually having monitoring for insects
and seeing what insects they have,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they have them, where they have them,
that we can take appropriate actions,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and this stuff, I know,
you know, you know, but traveling around
[SPEAKER_05]: the United States and all these emerging
markets everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and there's a lot of misinformation
and I would say when I first started this,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say more than half we're doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what they're doing is they're,
they're spraying like crazy, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so, and that, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the SOP and the Indian.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to tell people to stop
spraying, but the goal of IPM and this
[SPEAKER_05]: might be controversial is to eventually
reduce or eliminate chemical sprays or to
[SPEAKER_05]: reduce and even maybe organic sprays.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you want to get down to the
point where you pretty much aren't doing
[SPEAKER_05]: any, and that's not just because of sticky
traps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sticky traps are going to magically do
that on their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to do things like have good
genetics like yours, where you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they're tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're, they're proven.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the foundational stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think people fully wrap their
heads around how important that is yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's the only way they're going to
get to that next stage and get to that end
[SPEAKER_05]: goal, which is to stop spraying basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many variables too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you use soil, what's coming in on
your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's exactly, exactly right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's cultural controls,
cultural controls.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, humidity, uh, temperature,
um, all those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course, um, like we said,
sanitization and cleanliness, all those
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in, in the, the, the middle,
of all of that, the reason why I'm so
[SPEAKER_05]: passionate about with Catchmaster is that
it's to monitor the whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not enough monitoring going on in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to be monitoring from the,
from when you get the clones, you have,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have your pest monitor there and it
just pest monitor is a sticky trap,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the professional term.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have it there and you have it at the
teen stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have it at the growing stage,
the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a different zones.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't think about zones for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are just hanging them.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, one, you got to have one below the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to have one near the medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to have one at, or near the
canopy and one above the canopy as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and if you're in a greenhouse,
you want to have up above in the way up
[SPEAKER_05]: there in the peak, you have like an ag
roll rolled out for mature insects,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and all these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And have someone check those things,
you know, twice a week, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, I'm probably preaching to
the choir, but it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially with, you know, what you've got
going on with your brand is, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your whole thing is having, you know,
clean, good genetics, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and if you're selling clones,
you're only as good as your last clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you give someone hop late and Veroid
or whatever new viruses out, or you have,
[SPEAKER_04]: like pests, those are really big issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, that basically will,
you know, that little effect your brand,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people might buy your stuff because
you're popular or you're, you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the new hype guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you give them a virus that affects
their bottom line, affects their wallet,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to have a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's actually the other aspect of
IPM too, that I've, that I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: educating people on is IPM, even though it
says integrated pest management,
[SPEAKER_05]: a good IPM protocol or program or
practices is about profitability.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and that's why when you say reduce
pesticide sprays, well, why can't I just
[SPEAKER_05]: keep spraying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that costs you money.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one thing, it costs money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have mold and fungus,
viruses, all these things are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: affect yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spraying constantly could affect yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of reasons why you want to
have good, good IPM and good, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a good protocol and actually follow it
step-by-step in that order at the very,
[SPEAKER_05]: the very last resort should be chemical
spraying, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your last resort.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a certain point where it
always has to happen in any industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: restaurants, houses, hotels, throughout
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's a certain point where you
have infestations or infestations and
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes there's no choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you have a nursery, I mean,
there's protocols that you go through and
[SPEAKER_04]: then it's the same thing with your flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the less you spray, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have not only for your money,
but for your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the thing, the
controversial thing is that a common SOP
[SPEAKER_05]: is you spray this chemical twice a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's the, that's like that,
that's to, for, from my perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: from everything I've been learning,
really what it is, is you spray when you
[SPEAKER_05]: see this particular insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to be, you have a monitor out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you see a trip and then how many
trips per square does it trigger a
[SPEAKER_05]: particular spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's, that's, that's supposed
to, I mean, in a perfect world,
[SPEAKER_04]: in a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think one of the problems with that
is a lot of people are lazy and they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have people going through the rooms
looking for problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if you're very aware and it comes
down to awareness at a certain level,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, how aware are you of exactly
what's going on in your room on a,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I don't know, microscopic level,
but on a, on a pest level where you can
[SPEAKER_04]: identify problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I like the word monitoring.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Monitoring is super important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually I don't want to forget to
mention predatory insects, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: being a great, a great IPM solution,
you know, a program, part of a program.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another one where people will just
buy them those insects out of the idea
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're going to have mites or
they're going to have aphids, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there are people who are actually
releasing predatory insects, like as a
[SPEAKER_05]: preventative measure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's probably some people in that
industry that will recommend that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, you know, you know,
I don't want to start fights over that or
[SPEAKER_05]: anything like that, but I think it's,
it's more ideal to know what you have and
[SPEAKER_05]: when you have it and where you have it and
what insects to release.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cause again, that's wasting money and
resources and time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might not have ever known that you
actually had good genetics and they were
[SPEAKER_05]: clean and you're, you know, your medium,
you know, your medium was clean,
[SPEAKER_05]: like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on a 50 light room, how many traps do
you need?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you break it down?
[SPEAKER_04]: And exactly where do you hang?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the thing is I actually think of
it as like plant, plant count more so
[SPEAKER_05]: plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, you know, if you have planter beds,
it's a little different than if you have
[SPEAKER_05]: pots, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So with pots, you know, we're no,
this may sound funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I'm like, I'm now selling sticky
traps on me, like put one with every
[SPEAKER_05]: plant, right?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well you have plant tags.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you technically could put one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, we now make a plant ID.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we call a dual action plant
label.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that what that does is on one side,
you can, you write the name of the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: or, or, or, or a date even.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you turn it or whatever your
protocol is for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other side is actually a
transfer paper that you peel and that will
[SPEAKER_05]: actually be your pest monitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the coolest things I've seen this
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually I have one out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go through some of your products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are, this is the plant label.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the newest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like pre-release essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been showing just barely shown it
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's your standard thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be a little thicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a, like a, cause it's going to stick
in the medium, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to stick right in the rock wall
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you, you write right on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is completely dry, no glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have this nice transfer paper
on here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the transfer paper is what protects
the glue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're going to think, okay,
this is going to be all sticky.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to drip.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of that happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this, the, like I said, this company
is Atlantic pasting glue company that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's really behind catch master.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been doing this since the
1950s and they have like this viscosity is
[SPEAKER_05]: down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, you could see it doesn't leave
any residue on the finger at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put it right on the skin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't pull your hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and touch it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people are scared sometimes,
but go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the right, it's just the right
amount to catch flying insects and to
[SPEAKER_05]: monitor for insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice dry glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then you put these out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and this is a very cost-effective way
of doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually see this as more of a
nursery application, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, personally, I think four inch pots,
uh, clone racks at the end of your clone
[SPEAKER_05]: tray, every clone tray, um, and the four
inch pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you move into like, uh,
you know, a bigger one, which this is,
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is actually still considered
small for sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is what I would put.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every box comes with 72 cards and it
comes with stands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're double-sided sticky,
the same exact adhesive, like they're
[SPEAKER_05]: really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one's got the grid pattern on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can do your, your press monitoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it comes to the stand right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just go right down in the middle and
you just put this right in the medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they also have the, the twist
ties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that's the, what most people
are used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to hang one up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to answer your question, I would put,
you know, one, every, every plan or every
[SPEAKER_05]: other, the only reason why I'm saying that
is because I have, I have people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I wouldn't, I normally, this was
probably the first time I ever actually
[SPEAKER_05]: said it so boldly, but I'd have people
that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a Miami mango.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a big user of Catchmaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: He puts, uh, he does double, double
Rockwell, you know, the tiered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's got one, he's got a blue one and a
yellow one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the blue, blue one is actually for
monitoring for thrips.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so that's, it's a nice little,
uh, safety net to have in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then of course just hanging one
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every like maybe 500 square feet or
something like that above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For monitoring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the role, you know,
I don't want to make this too gimmicky and
[SPEAKER_04]: show all the products, but no,
I mean, that's kind of what the show is
[SPEAKER_04]: for when you got a good product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love sharing products that are good on
my show.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really, it's, it's, it becomes
authentic rather than like a sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I got into, you know,
going from companies like Botanic Air,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously very good companies,
vital garden supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I do care about who I'm working
for and what I'm representing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, just as well as I do,
those are, those are great products over
[SPEAKER_05]: the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bag roll is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of a greenhouse application.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you're looking at here,
if you don't know already, is this is six
[SPEAKER_05]: inches by 328 feet of double-sided sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like caution tape.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like, yeah, it pretty much
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put this one really, uh, traditionally
they, they put it above the canopy,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, up above.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there are people who are taking this,
cutting it in different orientations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's actually more cost effective for
some people to actually take it and cut
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obviously a messier, a little bit
more labor intensive to do that in my
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have seen it where people are
actually putting it on as end caps and
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor grow rooms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen, um, I've even seen Alex
experiment with, uh, taking, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a four inch or maybe six inch and then
cutting it and then sticking it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: rock wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so he's doing, he's messing
around with that too and getting some good
[SPEAKER_05]: results from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, but that's, yeah, that's an ag
roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's pretty much, I did bring some,
I brought one other thing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's way, way outside of, of the,
what the industry is used to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called a vector flylight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, yeah, I'll just, I'll just.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one I'm excited the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of a game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this, and I think the plant labels
are the biggest game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's seen sticky cards, but,
um, the plant label that's sticky,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think is super new and it'll be very
useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, this is actually something that
comes from the restaurant industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we wanted, I wanted to talk to you
about that too, cause I know you're,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're a restaurant guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is made by catch Buster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Catch Buster actually bought the company
vector.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but they, but catch Buster,
as you know, it makes glue boards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll show you how this BC pull this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thought that people have is
this is a fly zapper, like a bug zapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that is cool, but here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not sanitary, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bug zappers are not sanitary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't monitor the insect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's guts going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually implode bugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this actually is a special UV Phillips
bulbs that attract flying insects and it
[SPEAKER_05]: brings them to a glue board here inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this glue board, actually I caught
some bugs, uh, over a down in LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought this down with me in LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there's some gnats on there there,
but this is a blackboard to hide the
[SPEAKER_05]: insects.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do make white ones and yellow ones,
you know, and all that for better for
[SPEAKER_05]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, that's how that works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for bringing bugs in the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are, these are, uh, these are stuck
to the glue boards.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's one stuck by me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, homeland, where's the homeland
security?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the other thing to, to mention,
cause I get this a lot is, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, can you put it in the grow room?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's not, it's, that's not,
it's application.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to put it outside the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's got, uh, the hallways leading
to the grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the entrance, the exits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to have them all, all there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing too, is people put them up
too high.
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually want to have them about my
height, which is about four feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and you put them up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, and you want to have,
uh, near, you know, near, uh, garbage
[SPEAKER_05]: areas too, things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and that's just going to be a really
great addition to an IPM protocol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have garbages, you should
probably have lids on your garbage in your
[SPEAKER_04]: garage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see people doing it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: They miss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I mean, that should be added to IPM
protocol is making sure the trash is
[SPEAKER_05]: covered.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't even allow fruit, no fruit in the
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You let me in though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're the exception.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to tell everyone about this
little collaboration that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You brought this special gift for me and
these are pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell everybody about the
collaboration?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are so pre-packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what they are is they're chillums.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're American glass by high quality
chillums.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they come with these corks basically.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the idea is that you, they're,
they're always, they're always branded.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're essentially like,
um, you want to put your product in there
[SPEAKER_05]: so that you could showcase your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you, for example, like you're
promoting, if you're selling genetics and
[SPEAKER_05]: you got six different genetics,
this is a good, this would be a good
[SPEAKER_05]: example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you can actually have a label on each
one that would have the genetic and then
[SPEAKER_05]: within it would either be the seeds or,
or even better, maybe have the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way they can be like, Hey,
if I buy this guy's seeds or buy this
[SPEAKER_05]: guy's clones, this is the flower that's
going to be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a really clever way of
marketing your brand randomly though,
[SPEAKER_05]: but randomly though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had these made, they actually fit
perfectly in the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so yeah, these, uh, these are the seed
boxes that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And normally you get a glass vial and this
is some synchronicity right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some serious synchronicity boxes
he already had made.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I already have them separately.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the live chat, we are going to be
giving away some of these for trivia
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, really cool, dude, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Josh just showed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have Josh come on camera and
talk a little bit with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's actually got some bud for me
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got some blue dream that he grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody that doesn't know,
this is a Josh silverback Freeman.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go back 20 years, more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the sour guy, the man, the myth,
one of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, he actually is the real
silverback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he did not have, he had, he had full
dreads when I, when we first met,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was some silver in there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slowly turned all silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like a, uh, it looked like a
dead squirrel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about getting you on
here for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for, uh, introducing me to
Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a good show so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys having a good time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about grow illa and
botanic care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Royal gold Kings mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Royal gold, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kings mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a lot of things mix in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Age old.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started this new thing and I want to
play a game with you guys and we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to go around and we're going to name
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not a long game, but it's a
fun game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it always brings out the best in
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you guys are old school.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys remember some stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to start out with the aoda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know the cats have read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're farm cats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from the Tennessee farm,
but they're actually been in, we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonoma County when that work was being
done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've been in humble for like,
I don't know, two decades plus maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went to college up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys know each other from Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Alex before this, but some of the
very best herb that I've ever sour I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen besides the stuff I had grown in
Joe's growing has been from Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come from really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's like with sour,
I feel like there's like different levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got, you know, a guy that can
pull it off and make it look pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's some, a guy that gets like
maybe eight out of 10 runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's that perfect one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, Oh hell dude,
this is just a different sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brought that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually, I think the key to that
was actually, I grew it in six different
[SPEAKER_05]: climates, six different like situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And dialed, I figured out what was best,
but it's really, I had, I had,
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the multiple sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had multiple, multiple operations spread
all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was able to actually dial it in,
you know, like literally different things
[SPEAKER_05]: like light movers to like, I mean,
everything you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did rock wall to cocoa to what was the
best for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: My, my best actually was a Dutch pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally, I did, I did really good
with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so just so you guys, we've talked
about Dutch pots on the show, but for
[SPEAKER_04]: those of you guys that don't know,
Dutch spot, the Dutch pots were square
[SPEAKER_04]: pots with the hole in the back and they
were imported.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were $5 a piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only place you could buy them that
I know of in California was the garden
[SPEAKER_04]: spout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know, we all know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to drive out there to pick those
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was expensive back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you guys like about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never used one.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, for me, it was a frequent
watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was frequent watering.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, I think the other part of
that was because being able to correct
[SPEAKER_05]: problems like quickly, like through a
hydro or it was actually, it's actually
[SPEAKER_05]: been more popular now to be in smaller
pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were pretty small.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine was smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing like two gallon, like a little
two gallon Dutch pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a few different sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I filled it with in the hydroton.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need the hydroton in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you putting in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually, I was running botanical.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was running rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're little clay pot pebbles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now those were good for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they got kind of messed up for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: The salty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also one of the big problems is they
got started getting small.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they started slipping through the
elbow and clogging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that, and then you couldn't get
that consistency anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I ended up switching, switching off of
that after a while, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I ended up switching off of sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you switch to?
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I go from sour to, I played
around with, you know, cookies and OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually, I was able to fall back on
Blackberry Kush a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cause it has, it has its fandom.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I had its fandom at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember the Hassan?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me, tell me more about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it is lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were saying do the name game,
I was going to say lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be specifically clear here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some cats in Sonoma County that
came from out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say, I'm not going to name them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were tired of the Hassan name and
their buyers were, they changed the Hassan
[SPEAKER_01]: to lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I caught him red handed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught him red handed because I asked
him how long are you flowering your lamb's
[SPEAKER_01]: bread for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said 52 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, that's the Hassan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the photo of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that that was a Hassan on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, dude, that's not it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pink cream jasmine soda.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we go way back so we can talk about
these old school genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great because I haven't thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was the shortest flowering outdoor
plant that I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the one that never had problem with
fucking caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't get you that high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never yielded that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't get that high, but man,
it finished early and the taste was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get three by three bushes to be
over a pound outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was nice because that money,
like you're saying, would be there early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd have that set up for the tremors
coming in for the all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the lineage on that one,
Dino?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at the Jason King book and he
has something in there that talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, but that came from the
same cat I got that East Coast sour from.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought me both those at different
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some pink, other pink strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't remember that full name,
but like pink Cadillac or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a pink Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pink panties was, that was,
that should have been called black
[SPEAKER_04]: panties.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was throwing pink hairs, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the motivation for naming them
pink.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the pink, just depending on the
one, cause like the loud bear used to
[SPEAKER_04]: throw, you know, the 787, or you pop
those, you'd find a whole bunch of those
[SPEAKER_04]: that would have pink, pink pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry cheesecake Kush, also known as
the raspberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That threw the pink pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: That threw the pink ones too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really popular thing for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy Yielder, especially up in Southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got really big up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so Josh is one of my inspirations
for breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I wouldn't be here today doing what I
do without people like Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh came through for me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's another dude in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of you guys have been there for me
more times than I, like both of you cats,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've let you both know how you saved my
ass a million times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you're both here in the same room
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fucking cool actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some mutual contacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have so many mutual contacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were at a dinner a couple of weeks ago
and I know pretty much everybody at the
[SPEAKER_04]: dinner party.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like 20 people at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a fun dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one for the history books.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, it was, I invited people that were
going to be in LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty cheesy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were in LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a no, but you know, Josh,
he contributed the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grows PIF and he grows Q and black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'd never seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good personal, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, I like smoke smoking those on
the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your sour back in the day was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, uh, Brooks and I've
been talking to, we're going to see if we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get that original diesel out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to roll up some blue dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this blue dream here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really seen it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, and, uh, you know,
here it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes out bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would really, it's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has that, it has that beautiful color
and this one has tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really light that, that orange color
hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bright green.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want this is, this is great,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the power went out for four days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about that on the show
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really ties in with Alex, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, I had called everybody I knew to
get a thousand bucks because I was at
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowe's and they were down to four
generators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Sebastopol went out of power for four
days, let's just start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like on day two, I was, I started to
really worry, you know, this happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, day two was an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to definitely need a generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I called a couple of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one had anything to borrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have an extra one to borrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was out of power up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody in California, especially
Sebastopol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so then I ended up calling Alex and I
said, Hey man, I need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within an hour and a half,
I'm signing the release for the generator
[SPEAKER_01]: and walking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saved because like we hit 89% in
that room humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I'd already had some,
a loss with mold because, um, I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any dehus in there on this run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and blue dream grows big fat monster
buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my outdoor, I remember one time I
had the most beautiful cola and I was like
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at it and I kind of twisted it a
little bit and it split in half.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the bud had to be like that big.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what happens sometimes you get
a little bit of moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns into petritis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put all that effort in and you
see the most beautiful bud and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's there until you just touch it
and it does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, folds over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you looking for a caterpillar and then
you go in and all of a sudden it falls
[SPEAKER_04]: apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my eye, that was the beginning years
of botrytis, but now my eye, I can see it
[SPEAKER_01]: from so far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're walking in, there's that one leaf
on the bud that's like crinkled and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like an off color and you're like,
Oh my God, you can see it from 10 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, Oh, the whole room
is now you can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go in there like for three nights,
cutting out about a quarter ounce to a
[SPEAKER_01]: half an ounce of mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the power went out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I called Alex and then he said,
I got you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I moved out of Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't tell you that, but I've been
living out East of Sacramento towards
[SPEAKER_05]: Tahoe up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's calling me and it's late.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is he's got the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I've actually been saying
for like at least a couple of years now,
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted some good dream and I didn't have
the dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't grown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, since I last time I grew it was
up above Corbelle and Guerneville up in
[SPEAKER_05]: the hills up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was only one that didn't get eaten
up by this, that the new mites that were
[SPEAKER_05]: around at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When that, when that was going on,
the OGs were obliterated by the mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the first round is russet mites
came in?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, no one knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone thought it was systemic disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought it was a deficiency or a
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was exactly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last time I grew blue dream,
actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually once you learn how to treat
russet mites, it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I called my mom cause she's in town
still.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we used to live out here and she's,
she's still out here with her,
[SPEAKER_05]: with her husband.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I just told her it was up and
then I cashed her out for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now I, now I own, you know,
one of, you know, one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we traded a pound of blue for
generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I already have one taking care
of it's handled and it was, it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: week seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a copy on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at week seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nugs were thick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the power goes out for four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd already been cutting out the mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you came through with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saved that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still hit three pounds of light because
this is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the working man's weed boys,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anybody can grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's grows itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just feed it a little bit extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to have these
pre-roll, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have a saying, you could shit in
the reservoir and you'd still get 2.2
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You absolutely could.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it's the, it's the one thing that
like, it's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you feel good every time you grow
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were saying that when you walk into
the room, it makes you feel good about
[SPEAKER_01]: being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes you feel like you know what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not always like that with stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's finicky genetics that they don't
come out right every time you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, they're not a 10 out of 10
every time where I feel like blue dream is
[SPEAKER_04]: fairly easy to knock it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed one like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually you linked me with the guy who
gave me the clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Nick, you know,
he came through with the most stellar cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, you know, normally I won't
tell a guy because I don't want him to
[SPEAKER_01]: just inflate the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got, he's got a limited source.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this guy, like I said,
Hey bro, these are some of the best I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the stems I'm not exaggerating are
as thick as pencils every time on his
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that round turned out really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the microbe life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use biologic and, and, and just killed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's almost identical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually a lot of the last time I got
you cuts was, um, I got you the sure
[SPEAKER_05]: banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure banger is a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me a sure banger before a lot of
people got a sure banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and the thing was, is the,
his, the way that that indoor sure banger
[SPEAKER_05]: came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, I prized that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that weed so far, I mean,
I travel all the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, I know you travel too and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, I go around looking,
it's not blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you say they say got that blue
dream, it's not blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but there's a lot of S ones out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what happens is people get a bag
seed and there's like this round one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's this one that's going around.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like round.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like rounded.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is the shape you want to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to knuckle out like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knuckled out extra because the humidity
spikes that I was, well, it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's never going to finish too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it could just go on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep popping white hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it kept on, I could put it on the
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this thing keeps clocking in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this is a heavy hitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a heavy hitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just push.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it basically, it'll, it'll eat,
it'll drink.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's super.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a happy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs extra water compared to the rest
of the genetics I was running and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more food this one feeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Sativas are making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, people are starting to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some guys will say that, no, but I would
say that Sativas are, the older you get,
[SPEAKER_04]: the stronger the weed is going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that leathery Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the quest for more hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a friend, uh, shout out to funky
specimen out east.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to get me the redline haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says that's his favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people even heard of it,
so I'm pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to give some respect to,
uh, like I, I got some, um, white truffle
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed with, uh, killer banana.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of white truffle by
itself?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the, with the killer banana
actually came get, it grew like,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, actually grew a lot like a Afgoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew it outside and it had a lot of
Afgoo qualities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Afgoo is another great one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was super silver goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that super silver goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ripple plum, the ripple plum.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of Josh's creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a whole nother podcast
that had the super silver in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ripple plum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the sow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was the sour times.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the ripple plum was the Durban to the
super silver goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the Durban to the silver silver goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did a, I did a cross that went
around a little bit for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, um, I did OG and Jagu and called
it Jogger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got, I see that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I even grew that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I crossed that and then cloned it and got
it around for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'm sure there's other
iterations of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I either, I can't remember if we grew that
Joe and I are a homie or if I just saw
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have grabbed it from my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I know I've seen it around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I don't, I didn't want to
come on here and say, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm a breeder or genetics guy,
but like I played around enough to where I
[SPEAKER_05]: did one full year of just seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I was, I shockingly for some
reason, I had the intuition to like do a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of early, like low, low rider
crosses before it was popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like way before all of a sudden it became
like that was the value in having
[SPEAKER_05]: something for me because I was going up on
the Hills and we were trying to get those
[SPEAKER_05]: extra runs out and not have to pull tarps
and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You knew that because I was reading that
stuff in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never buy that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the thing is you could get them
like, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could order Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had all the low rider crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I call them low rider.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's an Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they were calling me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue low rider, red low rider.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it was a BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it, was it BC that did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're running them because the BC guys,
I mean the, I can't remember the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: up there, but he was popular and he,
that was what he specialized on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I would never fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was atomic something,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that atomic anyways?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some of the first auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see, I was, I was messing with the
Mexican ruderalis stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was, cause I, a lot of those,
a lot of those guys, that was where you
[SPEAKER_05]: could get the cheap like bulk and all
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I, but I kind of got real friendly
with them and I was kind of, kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing in some crosses of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was never good though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always smell like hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but there was some good ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some orange ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never saw the really good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only saw the hay coming down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause well from California, we were
getting them from the guys in the Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say it too though.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it was brick that was
reconstituted and they called that Arizona
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would just reconstitute it and then
call it early girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys remember?
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about blueberry Kush being
called blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the day, like you get weed
from Mexico and if it was green,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the pretend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the messy and the Mexican Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the whole, like there was
probably, it was probably some press green
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that was okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would get you high and it didn't give
you as much of a headache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were stoked when that came
through, at least I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you break it up and you put it in
the room with the shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put the shower on and get
that shit to poof up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how we just broke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just smoked it on a can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your parents trained you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause my dad had that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the dry version.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't had a seed pop off a can,
you don't know what growing or smoking is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Popcorn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other old strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, uh, so you stole both of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to say Hassan and, uh,
and I wanted to say pink cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we talked about the cushage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us about the cushage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you used to crush the cushage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's Adam Dunn's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OG times the sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interesting enough, that thing really
was, uh, PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, mine, the one I have had a great
calistole leaf ratio in my opinion was not
[SPEAKER_01]: a good, uh, hash maker, probably an
incredible producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the heaviest yielder strains I've
ever grown was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pushage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it threw off a tart note and a creamy
note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put it to the Durbin and that's
where we got the raspberry cheesecake
[SPEAKER_01]: cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it had that cheesy and flavor come
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got shortened down to just the
raspberry cush later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people mistake the blackberry
and raspberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look totally different, but,
um, that cushage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've grown his sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a good, how many weeks,
how many weeks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Adam and Mojave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the real strong shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many weeks would that run the,
the raspberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was like 62, 63 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but the sage is, uh,
I have access to some seeds that are from
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam's creation of the sage, a friend,
a mutual friend of ours, um, both fight
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, uh, one of the owners of Dutch
lighting innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's giving me those genetics that Adam
gave back to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll let him tell you the story
sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should definitely have them up here,
but, uh, the seeds that were used to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that they lost the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Bo still had them and Adam reached
out to Bo and gave them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Adam gave them the seeds that
created the sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bo's going to, I remember picking up
some packs of that sage actually with
[SPEAKER_05]: some, uh, God's breath, I think it was,
Oh really?
[SPEAKER_04]: God's breath was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or God's gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone made God's breath though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she had packs of God's breath.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it came to mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it was God's, at that time it
was God's gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it wasn't to the lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was to like a shark's breath.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had shark's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: God's fudge to shark's breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it shark's tooth?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's shark's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like, I feel like when I was
picking up the, all those packs kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: came together almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sage, I saw the sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that guy, um, that was just
crossing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in Amsterdam, not, um,
not Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those guys were just crossing
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they were making seeds of stuff
that didn't taste like as Americans,
[SPEAKER_04]: we were like, wait a second, that OG Kush
is not OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I got one strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Strawberry cough is a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Bruce Banner from the strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the strawberry cough is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like growing the cough because
you have to thin and release that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It branches out so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the Fort Collins cough better than
the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Fort Collins cough is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super special.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got some seeds of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made some banana, banana skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bananas, the banana cough is fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be some really good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got 10 of those in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was made in my backyard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hand water.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be, it's going to be
growing in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: King's mix, age old.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the hand water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still hand water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy, I don't know, I, I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 80 plants in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I woke up every morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I watered them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe helped me water sometimes when I was
gone or whatever out of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, like, I mean, we hand watered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I still enjoy, I won't do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's practical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think hand watering is, you know,
for me, I'm not a huge hand watering fan,
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor, but waking up in the morning where
you're tending to plants in your backyard,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still, I still do it as a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I've been, now I'm on the road all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, like I said, I used to grow a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to like, you know, I, I gave that a
lot of that up to, you know, for the
[SPEAKER_05]: ancillary market, you know, hitting,
hitting the United States and traveling
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still make sure I always,
I always got my plants there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do full season right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was doing, you know, I was tapered,
tapered from doing indoor to doing depth
[SPEAKER_05]: and then back to full grown and started a
full grown, you know, full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love, I love just to have in like
all different strains and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I still hand water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even two acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hand water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do it by myself, but me and my
guys will hand water two acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got over 30 years doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why I do it, it is because
I know it so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it and it understands me for
me to try and learn a different curve
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, there's not enough incentive in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's well, you have to teach the system to
water like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to teach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, my drive out to the farm and my space
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have cell reception.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so funny because you lived in the
same County, but it was like such a long
[SPEAKER_04]: drive to get to Kaz.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of a trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an hour and 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've got some of our best times going
up there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like driving up the one-on-one
for an hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: CHP up your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I'd see a sheriff a few
times a year driving out to Kaz.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So smoking slips is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Premium weather too up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I had some really good
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your depths were incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking elevation and just a banana
belt that Kazadero has.
[SPEAKER_04]: This special climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good for growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grew some good flower out of there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know who was there before me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mel Frank for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look in his books and you'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the same property.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same ranch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, you know, it will say
Kazadero underneath some of his photos in
[SPEAKER_01]: his books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the spot where you can see it 30
minutes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see it on a hill and then you
drive up to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basketball kind of ended up being like
a little like broker Mecca, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, it was like, because you had
humble folks, you had LA folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking before that was right before
we were all sending it out, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: or people were sending it out to New York
and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, but LA was actually coming
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were bringing it down to LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one cat rented a house in town and he
just have all the girls just drop off and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basketball was going on for years
right downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardcore coffee spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some hardcore coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy, you know, you got to pull up.
[SPEAKER_04]: When there was the hot monk, hot monk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I grew up in Sebastopol on Ives
park.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also ice park right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was like the spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that was, that was young.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked at powerhouse brewing company
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in Occidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would serve them at powerhouse brewing
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made, you remember that spot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the hot monk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to work for Luganese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's so interconnected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those dudes contributed to my vote too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony and, uh, well, cause they got into
all the, um, yeah, with the, the CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: drinks and all that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's actually funny to the thing
about hops too, that I find a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people just learning this for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they think of alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Drinks as just alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the content like, you know,
but you got to remember these are,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what's why they call them
spirits.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are elixirs, you know, and,
and they're all different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the best examples and proof of
that is a hoppy beer hops.
[SPEAKER_05]: It hops.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hoppoloids is actually a, uh,
a nervous system sedative on its own.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like forget the liquor and the alcohol
part, but the alcohol is like an extract
[SPEAKER_05]: form, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you start thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You say, when you think about that,
like tequila vodka, um, rum, all these
[SPEAKER_05]: different things, people go, I can't drink
rum, but I can drink tequila.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because it's something to do with
like the alkaloids or the extracts that
[SPEAKER_05]: they have from that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the hops and hops actually,
uh, you know, graphs to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I've done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the coolest things ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to send us pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, so I had humble hops and when I had
my house in Windsor at humble hops,
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it from humble hydroponics there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had it under, uh, in their little
tents, you know, they're growing hops in
[SPEAKER_05]: there and I got, I took a cutting from
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought it down and I fucking,
uh, I, I, uh, graphed it to chem dog 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they grow and they, they go dormant and
then they pop up and grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're really awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could actually, um, yeah, they're real
fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow very different than cannabis,
very different, but they, they're
[SPEAKER_05]: genetically similar enough to graph two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're from the same family for
those who don't know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can grow one on the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can grow a cannabis, you can go
cannabis on a hop and you can go on a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I've only done it one way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only done hops on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, let's, let's spark it up again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I'm all about R and D.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a great R and D thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could lead to the whole grafting
thing is always interested in me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Micah and I, back in the day, we almost
did a nursery project where we got OG Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: and we were going to graft it for,
you know, the outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_04]: So graphs of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause OG has like a small root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It struggles a little bit, but what
happens when you put it on a blue dream?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually think that there's roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's an, that's an, that's a R
and D valid thing to do is to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, I say probably the best root
stock to put anything on would be a blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the OG on a blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great root stock right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's, maybe that's the next stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, it's, they, there are some
crazy ass fruit trees out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it's much easier for an ant is
something that grows year after year after
[SPEAKER_05]: year of the same root stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you graft to something like that,
that's, you know, you're, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: encouraging that more and more multiple
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have multiple flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the ag world, they've had to do
that with fruits, with fruits,
[SPEAKER_05]: with walnuts, avocados.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walnuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for Paul to say they would self
pollinate and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another reason it's male and
female.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would do male and female walnuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots, the black walnut, I think it
was the American walnut wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root stock was much stronger than the
European walnut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything was dying from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they figured out how to graft it onto
the American.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of them, that's actually,
that's actually a great segue for wanting
[SPEAKER_05]: to invite both of you guys to a Kendall
Jackson winery or do a lunch out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother's a chef of out over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I mentioned that is
because that's an old Walnut farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually an old, old Walnut Grove.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they let me know this actually started
interrupting.
[SPEAKER_01]: James is an incredible chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: we actually mostly talked about it in
person, I think, or private value being in
[SPEAKER_05]: the food world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a whole different level like your
brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's actually what really inspired
me to like, to invite you guys out to
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's two reasons is like,
there's the food aspect, but it's also
[SPEAKER_05]: like a farm to table environment and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look, I don't work for Kendall
Jackson, but my brother does.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an awesome environment out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're master gardener out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to get you the name later,
what his name is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just the most immaculate thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also do like a thing where they do,
where you smell different foliages.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they grow different plants that you
smell while you drink wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of being a pairing,
cause they do food pairing and all that,
[SPEAKER_05]: which you expect, but they also do where
they grow plants just for their smell,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for their, you know,
and you, you break them and you take a sip
[SPEAKER_05]: of the wine and it's part of that
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, maybe bring the show down.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's reel it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cat piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot topic for debate is cat piss back in
the day was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's people saying it came out of
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that somebody read that had
ammonia smelled like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it cat piss.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like blue dream where it's a
specific name.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing a documentary on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People get to watch the documentary,
but dude, like the photos that you did in
[SPEAKER_04]: the book, not to say change subjects,
but the photos that you did, you,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben actually did the photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grew the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was grown by Josh.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the PIF.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the, uh, I believe the star dog
is in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got the PIF.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got all those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys ever, did you guys ever come
across the star fire?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't not the star fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the star star fighter star
fighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there was, cause there was fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure if you cross those together,
you get star fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of it, but I have not.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, that one's real, like a real
bright kind of, um, real bright.
[SPEAKER_05]: OG actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so it's still nothing to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was saying this earlier,
it beats chem 91 for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I think that one goes down in the
Guinness book for me as like just all
[SPEAKER_05]: around high the turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not the best commercially to
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not as tight of a
structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can have a really good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not fit the purple candy gas
model, but it fits the model that I like
[SPEAKER_04]: and that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Turt model for me is right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chem 91, but I, I like the smell of
burnt tires.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something that just brings me
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would actually use the word when I was
like, when I was like checking pounds out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, you gotta, you gotta,
when you're brokering, you gotta look at
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds and check them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that was the, I use burnt,
burnt rubbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was always looking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, but before anybody,
but we're talking before Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying that before, but I want to
say like chem 91 is great for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big up chem dog and the whole family
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a high two, but that sour diesel is
my favorite smoke all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the flavor of that is just what I
prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then side by side, I'd rather smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it burns better in a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was named sour because of sour
relationships, but it did the opposite for
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, we're here today because of
sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of great stories we have
that are positive about sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I've raised three daughters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: More positive than negative, especially
friendship wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it brought us together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour diesel was the one that brought us
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that chem dog didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog too, but I brought you the sour I
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me the chem you had, and I think
I gave you my silver back gorilla at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I had been looking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about the whole story later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, uh, the chem dog I got from you
was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 91 I got from sent out from Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good from Massachusetts,
from the Cape actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, but, uh, side by side for me
personally, I just liked the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it smokes in a joint is the sour,
you know, and the flavor, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I got, I got one thing that we got
to talk about before you guys go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The HK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Henry Kissinger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you might not know about it because
you're a little younger.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was like, was it Hindu Kush?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kissinger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kissinger was, yeah, that was the one
that was the amazing Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was before OG Kush and before all this,
or at least my experience, like that was
[SPEAKER_04]: the original Kush, but it was very
different than OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was master Kush and Bubba Kush with
that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Master Kush and Bubba was like,
yeah, that was like late nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the master and the Bubba and I
loved both of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were both top shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the exotics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of my first, I think my
first exotics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure on the master sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grew like the, it would basically grow
sideways.
[SPEAKER_04]: The buds would have like side branches.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was side branching on the actual.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little younger than you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit, just enough to where
like those were my first exotics for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't it a lower yielder too?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was real gassy though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really like, you could smoke at
roaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Bubba always got Petritus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you could smoke it at roaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba was fire though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was soapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a soapy for me and the Botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I peeled off a Bubba, but I bred with
it because I was like, that's a potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield was a nice and the look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you make the Larry Bubba?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who made the Larry Bubba?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it from Joe, I think actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't make that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were getting 6,400 a pound for that in
the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could buy one ounce or you could buy
like how?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like nine or 10 years old and like
92, 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: 98 is kind of where I got in like 90,
97, 98.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was young then too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 91 was the first year I started
smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm over here saying Chem 91 is my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: 91 was a good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the seeds we were running.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew from seed only and it was from the
Cincy Seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was their NL2,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember James back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was just, I got jumped into this
group as a new grower and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: already established like older guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was the new kid, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but later on I've tried to figure
out what was that Hindu Kush that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: from Neville because and what I've deduced
it down to and don't quote me on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's their NL2 is where the
Hindu Kush came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they changed it later years to Hindu
Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Hindu Kush is like a, a mountain
range in the- It's a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's obviously a story behind it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Kush Valley, the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think- The Hindu Kush, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also means something like
warrior or the story, like the Hindu word
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that has to do with- Oh,
but there's more meaning behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of violence and destruction.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've got to wrap the show up today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so glad to have you guys on,
but if somebody's looking to find out more
[SPEAKER_04]: about you, where can they get a hold of
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can get on my Instagram,
Silverback Growilla, G-R-O-W-I-L-L-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, that's probably the
best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or through you, you know, I'm going to be
offering some of this blue dream with your
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rolls and we've got all these seeds
combos we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just hit up your website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seed combos and then Catchmaster Alex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's pretty much what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Catchmaster underscore Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Catchmaster underscore Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can find it if you type it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there's, I don't think there's
another Catchmaster Alex at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not shadow band yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can, you can actually type in part
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do get my, some post band, but yeah,
so far so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll do it again soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to get our friend Joe on here and
then really talk about how the Durban
[SPEAKER_04]: poison came to the Bay as far as the
Durban poison that I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Came back to the Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Came back to the Bay through this guy
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for coming on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
