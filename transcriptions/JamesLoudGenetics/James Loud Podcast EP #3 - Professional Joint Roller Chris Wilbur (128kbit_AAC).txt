[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going everyone welcome to the
third episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we got a special guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Chris professional joint
roller at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you good?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me Yeah, so it's it's
kind of interesting how you came to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show I saw your Instagram and I saw
these badass joints and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man I want to get this guy on my show
and the last guest I had Chris castle you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually worked with him So when he came
on the show, he brought some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, is that poison gushers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we smoking on the poison gushers
and it was hand-rolled from professional
[SPEAKER_00]: joint roller does some super super super
great work So it was just kind of meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: be that you'd be on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, we've been working together now
for a couple months.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hit me up through Instagram and Yeah,
I've been working with his material now
[SPEAKER_03]: for What now five six weeks?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of his fire?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's got some good material there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the jungle cake I'm sort of partial
to that strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the jungle cake is super super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I like the poison gushers because
it's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's you know, the the goji the pine
salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all fire It's like it's got
the gas characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind green weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is the thing these days,
right the green weed It's like not not all
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah people didn't know what's up I mean
people that have spoken a long time still
[SPEAKER_01]: love green flower But I think a lot of the
market demands purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they want lemon cherry gelato runs
Yeah, you know even the skittles now has
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Well, everyone's just crossing it to
make it look prettier because it's always
[SPEAKER_03]: been like that strain that has zero bag
appeal But everyone that smokes it sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: knows what to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I mean honestly I'm just happy
that I'm in a place where I can choose
[SPEAKER_03]: what I want to smoke like like we were
talking about earlier I came from the East
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast and we didn't really have options of
what flavor of weed we wanted It was like
[SPEAKER_03]: do you want og or do you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever shit this dude just made up like
and it's all mids like it none of its good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed when you come out and actually see
what's available on the West Coast and
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically the Bay Area So how long
you've been smoking for I've been smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: since what is it like right after I
graduated high school basically And so
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of like a weird thing for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I basically grew up in a more sort of
traditional conservative household and No
[SPEAKER_03]: one in my family had really smoked weed So
it was always looked down upon and I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember in high school like when I found
out my friends were making the Sobe bottle
[SPEAKER_03]: bongs Yeah, I was super like distraught
cuz I was like they're throwing their
[SPEAKER_03]: lives away like these are my friends who
I've looked up to but like now they're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking weed like and I didn't really know
how to deal with it and So after a while I
[SPEAKER_03]: realized oh, it's not that big of a deal
Like they're just sort of happy and hungry
[SPEAKER_03]: around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care So I was always just
sort of that kid who was around the
[SPEAKER_03]: friends who smoked but never really
partook and then finally like the senior
[SPEAKER_03]: summer one of my friends we were we were a
little bit drunk and he was like hey like
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a star next to your name of the
people who I've smoked with and I was like
[SPEAKER_03]: well fuck it like let's do it and so I
went up we smoked a little bowl and then
[SPEAKER_03]: of course as things do with weed like
literally 30 seconds after I hit His bowl
[SPEAKER_03]: my friend's brother who was inside was
like, oh Wilbur's smoking like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting my big bong So I went immediately
upstairs and hit his like two and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: foot bong Nice, and so I was just
completely floored But at the same time I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like this isn't at all what I expected
like I expected to be completely out of my
[SPEAKER_03]: mind Like I was feeling fantastic totally
and I was like this is what I want like I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like the feeling I get with alcohol
as much but this is what I've been looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for and pretty much since then I was like
I got I kind of like control myself with
[SPEAKER_03]: this because I can feel how much I enjoy
Cannabis and I know probably shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking at this age So like I kind of
weaned myself into it where I was like I
[SPEAKER_03]: won't smoke for like a couple weeks So it
only spoke like once every few weeks and
[SPEAKER_03]: then of course like I went to college All
my friends in college smoked because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: playing d3 lacrosse And I don't know if
you know this but like the lacrosse
[SPEAKER_03]: community I would say probably 90 to 95
percent of lacrosse players smoke weed
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like basketball players exactly and
so we we all just like and football
[SPEAKER_03]: players and baseball players That's what
that's what we're finding out now is that
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone's doing this stuff I was
listening to a podcast the other week and
[SPEAKER_03]: an ex NFL D lineman was microdosing
mushrooms during games I believe it and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like now now looking back at him like
it makes sense Yeah, I mean Nate Diaz and
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Diaz these guys that would you know,
those guys have been smoking weed publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and now it comes out that
everybody's kind of been doing it all
[SPEAKER_03]: along Yeah, yeah the most part it's a trip
and there there really is that sort of I
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know not performance enhancing maybe
but it really helps you focus the mind
[SPEAKER_03]: more like sure whether it's whether it's
weed or like microdosing mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a similar experience where You're
sort of hyper focused on one specific task
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can really get into that groove of
sort of grinding whatever that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is right and I mean for me that was
like I would Wake up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had early morning lacrosse practices
and I would smoke before practice just to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of wake up and get my body going
totally I used to smoke and go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah looking jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah For me, it takes my mind out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do it I think that is the beauty of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're gonna go get on a
treadmill Let's start doing cardio.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way is to actually smoke a little
bit your mind completely out of it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a personal preference and
maybe it's not for everybody but man It
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely has helped me along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say it's definitely not for
everyone like I have Best friends of mine
[SPEAKER_03]: who like I'll will be out on the golf
course and I'll be two and a half joints
[SPEAKER_03]: in Hey, do you want to hit and it'd be
like not dude if I take one hit I'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: done for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and like I mean maybe some people
paranoia and I think it's because of The
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that maybe if they smoke
the right type of fucking flour or edible
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever it is Yes, I think edibles is
what ruined it for a lot of people to a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred percent my sister herself She was
I'd always talked to her about it like how
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke and all this stuff and she's like,
oh, yeah I tried weed with my friends one
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, yeah We decided we're gonna
make our own edibles and I was well there
[SPEAKER_03]: you fucked up right away I was like you
had a terrible night because you just
[SPEAKER_03]: literally dosed yourself with an unknown
amount of weed and for your first time
[SPEAKER_03]: ever experiencing it like That sounds
terrible for someone who's done it for
[SPEAKER_03]: what is it now 15 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean if you take too much coffee,
you're gonna have a bad experience 100% so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so funny because I think a lot of
people do relate that edible experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and Edibles on you know, this the strong
side can be stronger than mushrooms or LSD
[SPEAKER_01]: or other drug other psychedelic jokes It
can be just as potent or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely And isn't it because of
like the way it digests?
[SPEAKER_03]: In your body and it's so it's so it's not
really weed that you're getting anymore
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same THC high that you're
getting it metabolizes into a different
[SPEAKER_03]: drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is more Psychedelic than a
traditional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, you can get heart palpitations
all kinds of oh, yeah I've been stuck in
[SPEAKER_03]: my bed for hours off edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I curled up in blend, you know Yeah,
one time I was making edibles for Trey
[SPEAKER_01]: cool from Green Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And I was tasting him cuz he's like,
oh, yeah, we need a really really strong
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going overseas and I was Making fruity
pebble treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept tasting him and I didn't realize
how strong they were and I ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: curling up in my bed I have people
trimming to my house and my wife was like
[SPEAKER_01]: She was at work and I had to call her and
I'm like, I think I need to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital Hung up the phone on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god call her back And she's like you
need to man up, you know, you just ate
[SPEAKER_01]: some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Go figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I actually have a similar experience
my friend and I were making like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what firecrackers are Oh,
so it's basically the jankiest form of
[SPEAKER_03]: edible you can possibly make you take what
we would do is we'd make s'mores
[SPEAKER_03]: firecrackers So you take a graham cracker?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd put a little piece of chocolate down
you put a little peanut butter for fat for
[SPEAKER_03]: the weed to bind to and then you put a
marshmallow on top and so we were making
[SPEAKER_03]: these edibles and You have no idea what
the dose is on them and people were like
[SPEAKER_03]: you never did No, no people were liking
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were like, oh, let's make a batch or
two of brownies and cookies yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we're whipping up cookies like you
normally would eating some eating some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the batter and then My friends like oh
I've got to go like grab more materials
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't have enough to make all
these cookies that we've got batter for or
[SPEAKER_03]: we got we've got butter for and So he goes
to the grocery store and by the time he
[SPEAKER_03]: gets back like 40 minutes later I'm curled
up using a Betty Crocker box as a pillow
[SPEAKER_03]: just asleep on his kitchen floor and he
wakes me up and we busted out another like
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 something cookies Okay, so part of the
show and part of the fun of my show is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we get to taste some flour and so we
have a blind tasting we have three samples
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them is a less than $5 a gram joint
one of them is a less than $10 a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: joint and one of them is more than $15 a
gram and You actually helped me roll these
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some beautiful Beautiful cones
you do everything so you do cones you do
[SPEAKER_01]: big fat You know fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the normal ones that most people
know me for like Two grams typically and
[SPEAKER_03]: they have like the nozzle tips But these
are actually what I kind of prefer to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke if I'm just smoking like by myself
Or if I'm just rolling up quickly like
[SPEAKER_03]: either on a golf course or just at home So
you like to play golf?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I play golf a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really picky on the course I'm not
that good, but I didn't mean it's my main
[SPEAKER_03]: form of exercise these days getting out
and walking the golf course Nice yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have enough time for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so busy It's time-consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll eat regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It eats up a half a day If you're lucky it
needs up a half a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the minimum and then you're
exhausted afterwards Especially like I go
[SPEAKER_03]: out there and I walk so it's like a six
seven mile walk on long courses Like so a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the time you're exhausted
afterwards as far as when when you hit one
[SPEAKER_01]: of your joints You don't take big monster
hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take big monster hits I see
sometimes people like you know I was at a
[SPEAKER_01]: party the other day and people were
hitting it and all of a sudden it starts
[SPEAKER_01]: running and they're complaining about the
joint I'm like, dude, you can't fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: hit it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, expect it not to run, you know a lot
of the issues with with running typically
[SPEAKER_03]: come down to what exactly what you're
saying is people are used to that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: puff-puff pass mentality right that we all
grew up with where it's like every one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the group wants to get high so like let's
get this shit over with puff-puff and pass
[SPEAKER_03]: it along yeah, whereas We have access To
an amount of such quality material at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point to smoke that it's less now about
that Let's get high and more about the
[SPEAKER_03]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a Cohiba cigar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like that where you're you're in
this for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have is the Cohiba cigar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cigars, too I don't smoke a lot of
cigars, but it's that mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and you'll see what when I smoke
it's not I Typically don't take like
[SPEAKER_03]: direct to lung hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Typically will inhale into my mouth to
let that smoke cool down a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: to get more of that flavor Yeah,
where you see a lot of people when the
[SPEAKER_03]: joints start rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because they're Sucking directly into
their lungs and it causes that cherry to
[SPEAKER_03]: get way too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally What do you think of the way this
is burning in the way the ash looks?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion Ash?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it really ash is such like
a batch dependent sort of thing in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion like I've had I've had good weed
that Smokes like this where it's maybe not
[SPEAKER_03]: as white as it pod probably could be But
it's not offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smoke isn't I'm not upset with how
it's smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but The thing is it's typically a
mark of someone doing those couple extra
[SPEAKER_03]: things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that When you get that white ash,
it typically does come from better weed
[SPEAKER_03]: from the drying process Yeah, drying the
cure has a lot to do with it for one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but at the end of the day like
There's good material that smokes a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit darker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not be as pure white in genetics,
too Genetics definitely play a role in it
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something that we honestly
still are the jury is still out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're people still don't really know
what Exactly causes it because there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: many factors that go into growing the
plant sure I mean, maybe you can correct
[SPEAKER_03]: me if I'm wrong But like from my limited
knowledge like there's so many different
[SPEAKER_03]: factors that go in from the growing to the
drying process That it could be any one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those along the way that yeah It's not
just a lot of times people want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's how you flush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just how you flush it It's how it's
dried and cured and the actual I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we we understand it a lot more But
it's definitely not just one thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes it and that makes sense So yeah,
and what about oil rings?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion on an oil ring?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean if if you're not smoking the joint
Just to look for the oil ring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, then I don't think there's really
much To it and obviously it shows that
[SPEAKER_03]: there might be a little bit more THC
content in there But at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're holding that joint upside
down to consolidate that resin on the
[SPEAKER_03]: paper Yeah, it really it doesn't show that
much in my opinion and definitely how it's
[SPEAKER_03]: rolled to I think yeah Definitely the the
rolling style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely getting a good paper can
also contribute it to contribute to it
[SPEAKER_03]: because I feel like Papers that are a
little bit on the the slicker side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like like An elements paper they
show the ring a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's also because it's a little bit
lighter of a paper So what's your choice
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as papers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's what's if you were to pick one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what do you use paper?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I personally I typically smoke the
raw organic hems typically Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: just cuz that's sort of the flavor profile
that I'm used to if that makes sense Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: cuz every paper has a little bit of a
taste well hemp hemp seems to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more of a taste and a little
bit more of a Burn I get a little bit from
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, personally I do like hemp,
but I like race paper Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's that's what a lot of people
that's what a lot of people say is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they prefer like elements I just prefer
that cuz that's what I've gotten used to
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah And so it's kind of like when you're
tasting something you have to taste it on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of like whatever your Palate is Ross
got a lot of controversy right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's kind of crazy and the weird
thing about it is He's played it so well
[SPEAKER_03]: That you don't really know how much of
what came out of the lawsuit is true sure
[SPEAKER_03]: because with every lawsuit there's gonna
be a Colonel of truth where yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it might not have been made in alcoa Spain
It might have been made in the town next
[SPEAKER_03]: to it which seems to be the direction that
Josh from raw is sort of going with it
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I per I don't really care where the
paper came from Obviously, it seems kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of silly to me to lie about something like
that totally in any extent like who cares
[SPEAKER_03]: if it came from alcoa or came from The
town next to it like right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care I think it's
unfortunate that it's sort of blown up To
[SPEAKER_03]: the point but the way that he's handled I
think is great the exposing sort of where
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's coming from providing People an
opportunity to come and see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the truth is we live in a world of
snowflakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely so we've got a Less than
five dollar gram less than ten or a more
[SPEAKER_03]: than fifteen That's got to be less than
ten less than ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's my guess Okay, more than five
less than ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let you know at the end We've got to
get into number two And actually I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: throw you the lighter and we want to see
how you light it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can figure this out Cigar
lighter, that's that's pretty cool But
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all about that Coheba mentality Yeah,
I typically I mean similar to what you
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing It's honestly exactly how you'd
light a cigar just char the tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely and then once you see that
cherry coming Give it a couple blows and
[SPEAKER_03]: then inhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I don't know if you notice on on
that first joint it did start running a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit at the beginning Yeah,
but then it it balanced when you take your
[SPEAKER_03]: time with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it balances all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it dead?
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be dead
[SPEAKER_01]: Got my little collection very nice Yeah,
you can't fly with torch lighters by the
[SPEAKER_03]: way You can fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you fly with normal lighters?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go with normal lighters,
but you cannot fly with these torch
[SPEAKER_01]: lighters Any sort of torch lighter they
will take it or you can You know give it
[SPEAKER_01]: to somebody else or whatever like but
yeah, but you cannot fly You can put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: your check bag, but I think you got to
take out all the gas Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're so you're supposed to yeah,
I have a lighter that looks like a torch
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter But it's not and they always fuck
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like take it out of my bag It's not a
torch lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, okay, you'd have it so What
are the other travel tips that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: for us because that's that's a useful one
I didn't know that Yeah, same thing butane
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you smoke dabs, you don't want to
fly with that Oh, no, no, you obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: can't even check that you have to
basically take out all the gas and fly
[SPEAKER_03]: with an empty Explosions and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like those rosin carts a lot that I've
just recently sort of Yeah, rosin carts
[SPEAKER_03]: are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: My only concern though is you have no idea
what they're cutting it with Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's my only concern is like you get
some that tastes like better than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, well, it's not just Pure
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's like the cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got to talk to Nicky T.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got his way where he's doing I mean,
he's got pure on one of those guys Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the guys that are doing rosin carts
that aren't cutting it with anything Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that are thinning it has to with heat
Well, I'm not an expert subject at all
[SPEAKER_01]: because I believe in doubling down when
I'm good at I'm not trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything Yeah, of course kind of talking
about it a little earlier why I never got
[SPEAKER_01]: into mushrooms or anything Yeah,
it's just I believe that whatever you get
[SPEAKER_01]: it if you Double down on that you get rid
of out all the other distractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely You know, it's like you're
successful with joint roll your joints are
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do tutorials you have a Subscription
now on Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I was I was toying around because
they had some sort of like a Messaging
[SPEAKER_03]: platform and I think all it really is is
what Instagram used to be where if someone
[SPEAKER_03]: follows you They're gonna see your posts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which seems crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if someone follows you they want to
see what you have to say, but I'm not I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think I'm going down that that line
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the first one, what were the
flavors that you tasted?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bread I didn't get a ton of
it wasn't over.
[SPEAKER_03]: No any terms Yeah, it wasn't a ton of
flavor like maybe earthy but like nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing great thing gassy Maybe yeah,
but not like oh gee, you know It didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: stand out and that's why I sort of hedged
my bet with the the middle guess on that
[SPEAKER_03]: one This one I'm getting a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get more on that as well
[SPEAKER_01]: You know without seeing the bud it's like
such it's a different experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah looking at the bud and analyzing the
bud smelling it and trying to get those
[SPEAKER_03]: And I genuinely don't remember which is
which now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's it's like I'm really trying
to like Piece together this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would I would say is a little bit
smoother than the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I agree I Think it's smoother
and I think there's definitely more turps
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little bit of fruit in there a
little berry I get a little yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely some berry some Some gas for
sure on the back of it, but it's not super
[SPEAKER_01]: gassy and it's not super fruity It's just
kind of balanced and I mean for what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: worth There's a little bit more resin on
the paper for sure like I mean But I also
[SPEAKER_01]: the aftertaste is it lingers a lot longer
than the first one kind of like you'd hit
[SPEAKER_01]: it You get a little bit of flavor,
but it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this like after I take a hit It's
still on my palate for like 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well when you beef right before you handed
it back to me I still had a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor on my palate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I might have fucked up I think
that one might be I don't know now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that one might be the middle one
You think this one might be the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think the first one might be
the low one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay You can change it as we go
through All the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right That's what I'm thinking right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah The effect of this one is noticeably
stronger than the first Oh, absolutely not
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't even take as many hits of
the second one as I did of the first one
[SPEAKER_01]: Took more of the first one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I think we took like two or three
hits and I definitely feel the effect Like
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah uplifting and it's not like tight
around the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more just it's almost more of like
what people would call a sativa high Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: a hundred percent a hundred percent and I
don't smoke a lot of sativas No,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but it's definitely if anything,
it's like a sativa leaning hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not on that far end of sativa It
still has gas in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still has Almost like that caffeinated
buzz, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love caffeine with weed is always a good
combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh one of my favorite combo is a Cuban
coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah with with a nice like cigar nice or a
nice blunt I don't know if you've heard of
[SPEAKER_03]: gondorillo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he might be someone to look into
having on the podcast in the future
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, but he rolls heirloom Cuban
tobacco cigars with with cannabis in them
[SPEAKER_03]: and He invited me over his place a few
years ago when we were first sort of doing
[SPEAKER_03]: business together.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was selling Me a few few of his blunts
and so I go over there and he invites me
[SPEAKER_03]: into his home very welcoming So we we
smoked together and then he brings out
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to this a small cup of coffee and
I assumed it might be like an espresso or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that and he's like this is
a Cuban coffee and What it is is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: basically an espresso, but it's whipped in
with sugar, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like a sweet but like almost
silky Smooth espresso.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it was it was so delicious I had
like two or three of them and my heart was
[SPEAKER_03]: just racing the whole time, but it was
just like that that that experience of
[SPEAKER_03]: like the the cigar along with the Tobacco
and like the do you like Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I've ever had Vietnamese
coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you got to get them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know after this we'll go get some
Vietnamese coffee because Vietnamese
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee is one of my favorites They do it's
sweet because they use condensed milk,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do a slow Drip and a drip
actually goes in and it's like super
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, our race is you can't sleep at night
So we're gonna get into the third flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So so far so good today, I mean,
I really think the California market has
[SPEAKER_01]: improved over the last Year since the
beginning of covid till now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely improvements in quality
I think product is moving faster too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not sitting on the shelves quite
as long, which is a bad thing But I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of the shitty cultivators have
thought They're gonna come in and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: these mid quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and not even mid we're talking about
the low quality stuff Those dudes are
[SPEAKER_01]: gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so and I mean Well, I think also a
lot of it comes down to like people have
[SPEAKER_03]: now found their path into the legal market
Yeah, and I mean, there's there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: boutique brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of booths still a hundred
percent But I would say there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: really good boutique brands The struggle I
find is finding finding the quality brands
[SPEAKER_03]: in dispensary Like I typically am not a
dispensary shopper, but the last time I
[SPEAKER_03]: was in a dispensary The bud tender didn't
even know what he was talking about Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought one one like an ounce of one
flavor and then a week later came back and
[SPEAKER_03]: it was the same same packaging but a
different color Wow, and he had told me
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, yeah, it's it's the same bat or the
same strain but a different batch of it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I go back home and I look at the two
labels and it's completely different
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses of two Completely different
strains Wow, and I was like most people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what the hell is the difference
sure But does someone who does that's such
[SPEAKER_03]: like an off-putting experience Compared to
knowing the person who grows it knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: all of what went into it Well,
that's the difference between the the rec
[SPEAKER_01]: world and the black market back in the
days You're a lot closer to the cultivator
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part in California,
especially yeah, maybe not so in other
[SPEAKER_01]: states Whatever, but like in California we
were like blessed I mean growing up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bay We always had somebody who had weed
for the most part, but we had brown weed
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day We you know, I mean like
with fucking seeds in it before.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean the old Mexican weed and those
seeds are fucking I wish I had more of
[SPEAKER_01]: those still yes there's some interesting
stuff that came out of those and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but You were closer to the if you get got
homegrown weed the green stuff the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of fucking the areas up in
Humboldt in friggin Mendo and Sonoma,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they've been fucking producing
bomb-ass weed forever when there was home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that did good job, too But like
you're closer and so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just different experience Well,
so I grew up on the East Coast where like
[SPEAKER_03]: I was saying like you didn't always know
what strain you were buying like you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: all even trust what other people say the
strains are yeah, and then I Was very much
[SPEAKER_03]: like a person like I want to know like the
flavors I was smoking I want a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: different ones so I can like try different
strains and Growing up in like a small
[SPEAKER_03]: town in Massachusetts There's not a lot of
access to that but I was able to sort of I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know I was always making friends
with other people who had access to good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed or were just cool people to hang out
with and happen to also smoke and one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those people happened to be like the sort
of town weed supplier for the kids who
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't mind dealing with kind of the weird
guy and He would have like sort of you
[SPEAKER_03]: have set up here He would have ten
different strains and like you'd be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to sort of smell Sample some of them
totally and he would be able to tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, here's some purple Romulan Here's
like so and what year was this like around
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000s?
[SPEAKER_03]: No that well, so this was probably like
2011 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so he he had a guy out in
Washington who he would have wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: play a little bit more but he Could hand
select hey, I want these 12 strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I want the good shit I don't
want the shit you're peddling to most guys
[SPEAKER_03]: on the East Coast right and so he had that
quality flower and then when I went to
[SPEAKER_03]: school in Maryland it was the same sort of
thing where I was like I Want to know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm smoking I want to know where it comes
from and so I made those relationships and
[SPEAKER_03]: then when I came out to the West Coast it
was always Well who grew this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then I would meet the person who
grew It or I meet up the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually meet the person who grew it and
not to make any money off of them But
[SPEAKER_03]: simply for the sake of the relationship
I'm interested like you I don't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: expertise So I'm interested in what you're
doing like I want to know how you do that
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to witness this and then I can
maybe help you in something else or just
[SPEAKER_03]: watch it right and I think I was able to
sort of build those relationships because
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't worried about making any money
off of the relationship at all Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you're driven by passion,
you're gonna be more successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's like There's so many
different ways to make money, but like
[SPEAKER_01]: passion driven people are usually the
happiest Yeah, you know if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated by money I don't know that it's
definitely not the industry to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore if it's just money motivated but
Really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about your joint rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Your Instagram is professional joint
roller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir, and you have tips for people on
rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we do Some joint joiner videos
that will probably cut in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah people with people but yeah,
give us some tips Yeah so I mean a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the time people are dealing with either
papers that are too small or not enough
[SPEAKER_03]: weed is what I find and a lot of really
what joint rolling is is getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: material into the shape that into a
workable shape and so when I'm Rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically like cones like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not necessarily Like working the
material that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more shaping the paper into the shape
that I want it to be and The material then
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah goes goes with right and then from
there It's knowing what what it feels like
[SPEAKER_03]: to have like a clump in the joint so that
you can work those out sticky or dry weed
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be it's gotta be if I have to
choose it's gotta be sticky It's easier to
[SPEAKER_03]: roll sticky definitely easier to roll and
also Dry weed tends to run more because
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll get clumps on one side I mean,
I have a guy that grows the most amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and it always comes out super fucking
dry Yeah, I mean super dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it rolls fine and it burns fine
It actually breaks down super fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it burns real slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, that makes sense But you know,
I like sticky weed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I want it I want it so it doesn't
matter how dry it is The the resin is the
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely prefer A little bit on
the fresher side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cuz then I mean typically if I'm
rolling like a pound of joints They're not
[SPEAKER_03]: being smoked that next day as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you roll them when they're slightly
fresher Then they a lot they're allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: cure up in the paper a little bit and then
you get the joint when you'd want to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: it Yeah, you don't get it when it's too
fresh or too dry Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just remind Amsterdam we used to
I stayed in Amsterdam on and off for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of You know the 2010 through 2012 13
and 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd stay for extended amounts of
time with my buddy and he basically I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned how to roll joints Good for like
with the crutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah do a reverse roll in Amsterdam and My
buddy Abba.
[SPEAKER_01]: He taught me how to do it I was staying
with him and he like looked at my joint
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was like sad for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah He was actually sad for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like you need to learn how to roll
real good joints I don't know what that
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of a lot of people are too
heavy-handed With it where they try to
[SPEAKER_03]: like Crunch the paper into the form.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think a joint should be yeah where
it's really like the less that you
[SPEAKER_03]: Manipulate the paper the better like so
you're almost using the paper to form the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed You're not necessarily like forming
the paper itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like so the old Joint rolling
you remember the joint rollers from back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah two bars, of course The whole concept
is doing the same thing with your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Shaping it and then using that top I
use the top paper to push over Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know you're basically my when I roll
my left thumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah stays on the crutch Yeah,
and so it doesn't move from there because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's basically the most important part
is getting that crutch tight Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then from there you're just basically
what you said you're you're you're forming
[SPEAKER_03]: the weed but with the paper as you're
basically like your finger Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then as you go you're getting that
fold from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get out of or actually you have a
paper Over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So you're getting that fold and
that's the part that most people struggle
[SPEAKER_03]: on is Getting the fold over You're getting
that fold Simply by going over that
[SPEAKER_03]: material And then running your thumb there
enough to where the material is down and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get that glue strip over top of
that paper Totally and that's what I think
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people over complicate the the
whole thing and that's why I've sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: Simplified my joint rolling process
Whereas I don't roll these on mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I roll them I roll my joints a
slightly different way more like a cigar
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be Sort of rolled out totally how
many joints can you roll in a day?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm putting in a 10 11 hour day I can
typically roll about 150 to like 160
[SPEAKER_01]: joints nice so then I guess Let's dive
into what you think number three is is
[SPEAKER_01]: that that one got me high I feel I mean
they've all kind of what I think had the
[SPEAKER_01]: best flavor in my shirt I would agree that
it had the best flavor the best Finish it
[SPEAKER_01]: had fucking turps and it's halfway down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep smoking that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it tastes so fucking yeah What kind
of turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting a little bit more More of like an
LCG turp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it's definitely like a good
candy turp I would say like yeah candy
[SPEAKER_01]: floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah candy floral gas You know,
I feel like it got it has that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely layers of flavors It's
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that definitely cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah fucking strong cherry note in there
Yeah, I think I know which one that that
[SPEAKER_03]: one is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would assume that one's the What
is it cherry poppers?
[SPEAKER_03]: I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know in that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are gonna go through these now and I
would assume is the most expensive one the
[SPEAKER_03]: most Expensive so I would go I would go
Three two one so expensive middle low
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what I'm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay now this one Is oak fruit land still
amazing this this is kind of special
[SPEAKER_01]: though So this oak fruit land was I went
to cookies Hayward big shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies Hayward But I went there today and
picked that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a thirty dollar Thirty dollar
quarter ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow and normally It's like sixty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that was their thirty dollar
special the price for the price fuck Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't beat it, but that's the less
than ten dollar damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was oak fruit land and Sherbert
times Piscotti.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah fortune cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember fortune cookies back in the day
was just a phenotype of Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: like the forum cut or Maybe it was one of
the other random cuts that it was if but
[SPEAKER_01]: fortune cookies was just cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the next one Boom, I really want
to smell This one, but this one right here
[SPEAKER_01]: was the less than five So which it was
good less than five the sativa one big
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave's bud Gummies, which was jet-fueled
gelato times peach rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that makes sense that peach rings
That's from dying breed fucking turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got good turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Marion Barry times That's definitely
a TV hybrid then yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got the jet-fueled gelato,
which is definitely On the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but as far as it was hmm Marion Barry
times something But uh, yeah, so man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fucking high off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we we go in the order here and
number three Yeah, you guessed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely the more expensive Super
dope cherry poppers LCG s1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, or LCG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes just like LCG definitely
definitely definitely smoked well Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds are nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely definitely on the drier
side But I mean you got to think at least
[SPEAKER_03]: at least five dollars out of that is going
into the artwork So yeah, I mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: impressive their packaging is impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's like a big collab, too Well,
man, it's been it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me Yeah, for sure.

[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do we have to do a collaboration
with some flour Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you
