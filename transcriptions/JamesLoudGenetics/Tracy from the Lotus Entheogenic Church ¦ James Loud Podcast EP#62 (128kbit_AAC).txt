[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And today our special guest is Tracy,
the founder of the Lotus Church in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today, Tracy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: We met on 420 this year, which was a
serendipitous day for me because my friend
[SPEAKER_04]: passed and 420 being what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a really special day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really nice meeting you on 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad you finally made it on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SF Weed Week.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really cool day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we got to meet a lot of people,
new people, see familiar faces that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: known in the industry just for the past
years that we've been a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really great event.
[SPEAKER_04]: David Downs did an exceptional job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I had a really good time there and
I think it was set up really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the perfect amount of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't too crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't too mellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just just right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the right blend of people,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like there was a little bit of
everybody from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I liked that he brought in other
companies, maybe not so well known and
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed it in with, you know, some of the
more familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like the big guys with the
little guys and a little blend of
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody in between and everybody that
was there was there to party and
[SPEAKER_04]: celebrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was just good vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good time there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us about the psychedelic church
and what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I started doing psychedelics when
I was 14, 15, not something that I suggest
[SPEAKER_03]: 14, 15 year olds do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But being a punk in Olympia at the time,
that's kind of what we did was forage for
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mostly blue ringers and Liberty caps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Olympia, Washington, Olympia, Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dave was from Linwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, was he?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was born in Portland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're all Western neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ended up doing some mushrooms with a
best friend of mine for a birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did far too many.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And had an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went to a concert, danced like it was
1992.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just like, you know,
I remember like you grew weed in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I did say, but you grow
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a dare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, take that challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I read, I studied mycology for a year
and then finally did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the pandemic hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And up until that point, I'd been working
for billionaires as a newborn care
[SPEAKER_03]: specialist and private chef.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that work kind of died right in that
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the wealthiest of the wealthy were
not having anybody in their homes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, well, I just learned the
skill of growing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the ladies that I was working
with, she's one of the original Black
[SPEAKER_03]: Panthers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, you know, your medicine is
the cleanest medicine I've come across in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: In what a great time to be in Oakland,
you know, because they had decriminalized
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And psychedelics, most psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not most, but selective ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, I'm going to take you
into the streets of Oakland and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get this medicine out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she took me into deep east Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never been out that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And started doing sashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just bloomed from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a word of mouth spread around
the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to national conferences,
letting people know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the benefits of psilocybin and the healing
properties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people came back to me with
the positive, immediate results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of their use of psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started doing more research and I
realized this is something that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be transformative for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it shouldn't be relegated to just a
select few people that can afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's when I started to think
about paths to getting medicine to people
[SPEAKER_03]: and doing it in a legal way, in a way that
celebrates the medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a church seems like the best path.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a community space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a space where people can come and get
education, celebrate the medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: find spiritual awakening and in an
autonomous way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big proponent of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually took psychedelics before I
smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was afraid of cannabis when I was 14,
but there is this little paper that my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend had that said, you know,
they could get you high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was LSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these little tabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had done that probably 10 times
before I smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's an opposite way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such the opposite of most people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was running cross country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried about my lungs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was, I mean, I guess I wasn't that
smart as a kid, but you know, I tried
[SPEAKER_04]: different things and that was definitely
like the psychedelics opened me up to
[SPEAKER_04]: everything else and the possibilities of
others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think used correctly, it can be a
life-changing experience and psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is, especially psilocybin
and LSD and some of these other compounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's transformative right
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you get direct effect that can be
life-changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you go there, you can never go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that can be a really amazing
thing, especially fear and anxiety and
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the things that you can get over
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred percent, especially with people
with severe depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had multiple people come to me and
just cry at the table and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you saved my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I literally wanted to die that day
and someone gave me some of your capsules
[SPEAKER_03]: and it reversed my entire way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you have something that
transformative and that immediate,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are so many people, I mean,
we see it here in the streets of Oakland
[SPEAKER_03]: every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The level of desperation, the lack of
mental health treatment for a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you look at that and just turn
your head?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you come to the realization that
psilocybin is something that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: heal a lot of people, why would you deny
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I feel like it was just like,
you know, all this stuff, we even CBD was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of looked at negatively.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, until Sanjay Gupta came up and
said, look, these kids are getting cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for instance, mushrooms, I have a
friend, he has severe migraines and the
[SPEAKER_04]: only cure is psilocybin mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally the only cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has to take a pretty big dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he does it, he actually knows how to
regulate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it's coming on, he takes it before
it hits him hard and then he doesn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: the severe migraines.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can you say that's wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's my big argument is how
can you say that somebody's health
[SPEAKER_04]: shouldn't be in their own hands if it's
not hurting anybody else and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you say that's bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are studies that now,
I mean, from Ivy League institutions and
[SPEAKER_03]: other reputable universities around the
world, that it regenerates neuron growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we live in like this fear-based
culture of like, don't hurt yourself by
[SPEAKER_03]: doing just anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finding out that psilocybin reverses it
and actually regenerates neuron growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's huge for people with CTE and NSL
players with brain damage.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: People with Alzheimer's, people with
postpartum depression, people with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean- And we're just
scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, then that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we still have so much to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much potential for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we do know is that it helps
people with addictions and it helps people
[SPEAKER_03]: with depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the main thing that we're
dealing with in the United States right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So- Well, we live in a fear-based society
and I think a lot of religions are founded
[SPEAKER_04]: around fear and unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we live in this fear-based society.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to be, you should be afraid of
stuff and you should be afraid,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I think that drives- Well,
at least Western religions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western religions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Western religions, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and I don't think all of those
religions were founded and meant to be
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it evolved to be like that over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a control mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a control mechanism for the masses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same with, you know, government
control over planet medicine, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they want to push their own
agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they instill fear into people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear for profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've made it my mission to create
this safe space where I don't push an
[SPEAKER_03]: agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't push a dogma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not pushing a specific, you know,
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a space where people can come and
find their own spiritual path or they can
[SPEAKER_03]: find their own healing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just provide the cleanest medicine for
you to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have avenues if you're looking
for a therapist or if you're looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: ceremony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that it's
self-exploration, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, we all need to
explore what works for us because our body
[SPEAKER_04]: chemistries are so uniquely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like there's no
one-size-fits-all solution for any of our
[SPEAKER_04]: problems because we're all so uniquely
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's beautiful if you can go and start
exploring what works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, finding out what doesn't
work is a great way to find out what
[SPEAKER_04]: works.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a process of elimination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with that, you have to be careful too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extremely careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's why, you know, having a guide
or having somebody who can help show you
[SPEAKER_04]: the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think microdose is now a
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was a kid, there was no
microdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to eat eighths of mushrooms pretty
regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And quarters of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even weigh it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most I had was a quarter when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't weigh it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just picked them and made tea and drank
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we would just eat it right out of the
forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like tea the best, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me personally, I like the tea because
it doesn't mess up my stomach as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas if certain types of mushrooms
really mess my stomach.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like mushrooms for public speaking,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I've done microdose and
I've done a little bit more than
[SPEAKER_04]: microdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've learned that, you know,
you got to tone it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little religious at MJ Biz a
little time talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I get really excited about
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I like about psychedelics is
specifically mushrooms for public speaking
[SPEAKER_04]: is I don't have to use memory recall.
[SPEAKER_04]: That goes away and I start talking from
the heart where it just flows.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm able to get my point across and
I'm not really thinking or trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: process what I should say next.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a very clear stream of
consciousness where it's not disconnected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of flows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then I feel like it comes across
as more authentic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some of these shows, I take
microdoses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on the individual show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, the self-exploration
side where I'm like exploring what works
[SPEAKER_04]: for me and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so many compounds now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we had like three or four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we're in a beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we really are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with the church and allowing
people to keep that control within the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sacred that you have your own ability
to choose your own path of healing and the
[SPEAKER_03]: motive and speed that you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really agree with the therapeutic,
like the whole model of people sitting in
[SPEAKER_03]: a room with eye masks on and a blanket and
holding the hand of a therapist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That to me is isolating and also
borderline inappropriate in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of a time in my personal
experience in a therapist's office where
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone would ever touch you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't see how that is appropriate,
especially when someone's under the
[SPEAKER_03]: influence and you've opened someone's mind
completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to do it certain ways,
then there has to be very strict
[SPEAKER_03]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, I think they've kind of
failed on that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even do background checks on
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spoke at a conference and they didn't
even know where you would look for
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody that's like where you would look
up someone's name that was sex offender.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and it's because it's been gray area
and it's not accepted by the masses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's starting to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's been, you know,
it's leaps and bounds from where it used
[SPEAKER_04]: to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was very much against the mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of people were against
cannabis and now more than 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's closer to 70% now or pro
cannabis, especially for medical use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Dennis Prohn said it's medical
whether you believe in it or not,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I feel like psychedelics are the same
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they can be therapeutic and medically
beneficial, especially for your psyche.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for your whole feeling of
connectedness to the world and trauma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we, you know, we talk about filters,
I talk about this on my show quite often,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the filters that go over from every
experience you have, you have a filter
[SPEAKER_04]: that goes over your eyes and that's how
you see the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the time you're born, you develop
these filters and it's great to take some
[SPEAKER_04]: of those filters off and see the world,
how it really is again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's almost the only way I think
there's, you know, meditation and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddhist monks where, you know,
they were able to tap in to their inner
[SPEAKER_04]: DMT too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I think that stuff it's amazing
and I feel like it's gaining momentum.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that it's decriminalized in
several states or places, cities,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess more than states, but it's going
in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you have articles in Vanity
Fair and you have mothers talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: starting market drugs in groups in the
Midwest, I mean, you've kind of touched
[SPEAKER_03]: the spots that really need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spreading.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spreading really quickly when people
take it and they realize that they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be tripping out, that it's
actually like, it's almost like,
[SPEAKER_03]: how I describe it is like a natural
volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the fogginess, without saying yes
to everything, you're just calm and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: in a place of Zen and you can navigate the
world from a place of just more grounded
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking and just feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the awareness aspect of it is so
amazing because a lot of us aren't aware
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're not living in the moment either.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of feel like a lot of us either
live in the past or they live in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future or both at different moments in
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with psychedelics, you can really go
into the moment without even having to
[SPEAKER_04]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're all in the moment all the
time, but to put us there mentally,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of people, it's a big breath
of relief.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of the danger with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't say danger, but things that we
need to be cognizant of is that you
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't be using psychedelics as just an
escape from your current reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be used in a way that opens you
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that when you do the actual
reality, you have a better understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do see some people in the community
that use it as a way of escape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't necessarily agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, like I don't judge
people and I don't dictate how people use
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everyone has their own path.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all make mistakes and we hopefully
learn from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's the beauty of
life too, is like making mistakes so you
[SPEAKER_04]: can learn from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the beauty of psychedelics,
especially like mushrooms, is it's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: safer than even cannabis to where you can
take a heavy dose and you can feel pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: scared, but you're going to be okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no level of addiction to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: None.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you've done a heavy dose,
you know that there's no level of
[SPEAKER_04]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, that's all you need
is one good, heavy dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: During COVID, I was with Marlin and we ate
16 grams of some golden teachers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't recommend that to anybody
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Marlin is, yeah, he's a mushroom
connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it maybe was over 16 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might've been 17 or 18, but either way,
it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still beyond a heroic dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was over a period of a good amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were at like the worst reggae show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started eating mushrooms and we
went back to the house and we hung out and
[SPEAKER_04]: we were alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were laughing so hard, but we put on TV
and the first thing that came on was UFC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of us looked at each other like,
no, we can't watch this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were trying to like,
we were probably spent like 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to find something to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Disney has to have something
that we can watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we stumbled on this show called Pickle
and Peanut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pickle and Peanut was designed and
must have been written by somebody who
[SPEAKER_04]: uses lots of psychedelics, not weed,
definitely psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: They incorporate animation with like a
live video of like animals and people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we laughed so hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably laughed for four or five hours
straight where I would look at him and I
[SPEAKER_04]: would start laughing and then he would
start laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I try to stop laughing,
but he was laughing so I couldn't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of us just, we were on the floor
and literally my stomach hurt and my
[SPEAKER_04]: cheeks hurt from laughing so hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had a hangover the next day
from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get hangovers from
psychedelics, from mushrooms, if you eat
[SPEAKER_04]: too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have physical feelings of just like
you did a thousand crunches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and you probably did, you know,
in that same notion, you probably did
[SPEAKER_04]: equivalent to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but those are good experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fun stories and, you know,
and it's like, it's not like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: You drink too much alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in the hospital, you could die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the worst thing that happens usually,
I mean- You see God in some aliens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you see God in some aliens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you don't take your clothes off
and run naked through the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't find that to be the case with
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: With LSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it happen with mushrooms once,
but usually it's the LSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was a combination of
mushrooms and alcohol that maybe had,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, pushed somebody over the limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends when we were younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's always great stories
about people on psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I just, I think there's such an
amazing thing and I wish everybody had the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity in their life to experience
them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for everybody though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you have been diagnosed with
schizophrenia or if your family,
[SPEAKER_03]: like one of your immediate family members
has schizophrenia, you should never do
[SPEAKER_03]: psilocybin because if you don't have the
symptoms of it and you do psilocybin,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could trigger that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think cannabis can also do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean, there's, there's a,
yeah, I think there's something for
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody and maybe it's not psychedelics
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe marijuana cannabis isn't for
everybody either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact is that there's only a few
people that can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, schizophrenia, epilepsy,
and high blood pressure, diabetes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and everyone that that leaves a wide range
of other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that can do it and should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people that have had trauma.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to see if it can help
with your trauma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, you know, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree under certain circumstances.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Directly after traumatic experience,
probably not the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, childhood trauma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think childhood trauma is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all have childhood trauma.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't think you have childhood
trauma, you're probably wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's very few people I know
that don't, I mean, I don't know anybody
[SPEAKER_04]: actually that doesn't have some form of
childhood trauma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone's idea of what is traumatic
is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think you can, you can judge
like, oh, your trauma wasn't as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as, you know, severe as mine or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that psilocybin is super
healing on whatever range of trauma it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you guys do any form of like
mescaline or anything else like cactus?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: San Pedro, those women.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have it from time to time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we do have vendors that come through
that do have cacti plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not something that we regularly
offer there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big fan of all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my stuff to a degree, but I just,
I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is, is when I saw the legal
pathway for psilocybin coming down,
[SPEAKER_04]: I had friends that are like, you should
breed psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, you can, you can do
breeding and selection to a degree with
[SPEAKER_04]: psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, I'm a cannabis guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been fighting for cannabis my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And believing in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that that's my plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love being on the sidelines and
watching all my other friends win and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, seeing the trials and
tribulations going on because it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as easy as people thought in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a lot of people dive in,
invest a lot of money, lose a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just excited being on the
sidelines and being able to try these
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's like mushroom gummies.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was never mushroom gummies growing
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had like maybe mushroom chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody would make some chocolates that
had them in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they ground up, you know, and,
but the level of quality is just amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: how far it's come and the different
varieties of stuff that you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think they have sprays now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a, yeah, sublingual.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gummies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you name it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as far as whatever you can think
of, just like cannabis edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen a beverage yet,
but I bet you it's either coming or it's
[SPEAKER_04]: already out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a beverage already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a beverage in our, at our
location.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a powdered drink, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it in the cap?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes in two tubes and then you mix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love it because I feel like eating
mushrooms, is it for everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like cardboard and sunflower
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's how I describe eating
actual dry mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them taste shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them don't, but like they
shouldn't, but some of them back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day when I was a kid, there was actual
shit on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pulled out of shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're out of Kalman who are
specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think that, it's amazing
because people are more inclined to try
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a gummy or if it's something
appealing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because mushrooms don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they do not taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people, they're like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the taste of it, but typically
people are like, I don't want to go sit
[SPEAKER_03]: and eat a bunch of dried mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'd rather drink tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I was going to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like tea is the one that hits
you right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the most effective in my opinion,
but yeah, there's the chocolates are good
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the interesting thing between
now and 20 years ago for me with
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms, especially is I used to get
stomach aches from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had this thing where I'd eat green M
&Ms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so psychologically the green M&Ms,
you know, they have very little actual
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate in M&Ms, but psychologically
they were very helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I really liked green M&Ms with
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a lot of this stuff doesn't give me
the stomach aches like it used to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think different versions of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the varieties that give you the
stomach ache.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that is really
missing from the psychedelic education
[SPEAKER_03]: right now is food safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should never be getting sick on
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should never be vomiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should never have diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not purging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are getting sick from mushrooms,
it's because of food poisoning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I heard some of the ones that like the
penis M&Ms, they don't have like they're
[SPEAKER_04]: open caps and so they don't have spores.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I heard that the spores are
actually what would cause stomach,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I never got like sick to where I was
thrown up typically, but it would give me
[SPEAKER_04]: that twisting in my stomach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody wants to have that feeling when
they're feeling the effects of
[SPEAKER_04]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's another reason that it may be
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a very small subset of people
that have an aversion to chitin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And chitin is a protein that's in the
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a protein that's in the
exoskeleton of insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people find that hard to digest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for those folks, tea or extract is
the only way that you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it without getting a stomach ache.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a very small percentage that have
that aversion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible that you have that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the stuff today, none of it gives
me stomach aches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was food poisoning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably food poisoning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people come to me and they're like,
oh man, I took this, I ate this chocolate
[SPEAKER_03]: bar and I was vomiting and oh,
I had the runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's because you ate a really
disgusting chocolate that was not made
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: People handle mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see people handling mushrooms with
their hands after handling money,
[SPEAKER_03]: after it falling on the floor,
it's not weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not putting it in a pipe and burning
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're eating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you eat French fries that fell on
the floor?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you eat mushrooms that fell on
the floor?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Food safety is so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be a chef as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think food safety is so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people look past it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the early mushroom things
were made by people in their houses or
[SPEAKER_04]: wherever, hotel rooms, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sanitary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sanitary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not thinking about- No health
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not thinking about how you handle the
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put them in a bag and it's rolling
around with manure in there and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: take it home and you eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you just ate manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's stuff like that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just eating one with shit and handling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another thing is I see a lot of
people posting photos of mushrooms dried
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're covered with brown on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, that is- Unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unnecessary and it just took- In this day
and age anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, and the knowledge is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just laziness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think, yeah, I mean, really what
they should be doing is cutting off the
[SPEAKER_04]: toss bag nose and then extracting what's
left in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or cutting it before you dehydrate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one step.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one step.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people are thinking too far ahead
with, oh, I don't want to lose weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're worried about their yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they leave it on there and they think,
oh, I'll brush it after it's dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, it's super time consuming to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the amount of substrate that you leave
on it is negligible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just cut it and dehydrate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be so dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the people who don't know and
are consuming it, they're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, I thought the brown stuff was supposed
to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, would you take a salt shaker and
put that all into a little salt shaker and
[SPEAKER_03]: sprinkle it on your eggs and eat it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then don't eat it off the bottom of a
mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's interesting the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is because we're just in the
infancy of legalization, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at where cannabis is now,
especially with packaging and with safety
[SPEAKER_04]: standards in rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying it's perfect,
but it's safer than any other ag product,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tested heavier.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some ways, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other ways, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like it's fail proof?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think stuff slips through the
cracks?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff slips through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can spray stuff that is not
necessarily good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's OMRI listed, does not
necessarily mean it's good, especially if
[SPEAKER_04]: you spray it at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, you might be able to pass
testing, but that doesn't mean you're
[SPEAKER_04]: creating a product that's still good for
people to consume just because it's OMRI
[SPEAKER_04]: listed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people need to get out of that
mindset.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of preventative
stuff people can do, especially with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't have to spray, or they'll
have to spray at a very minimum amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the less you spray, especially if
you're making extract from it,
[SPEAKER_04]: the less you spray, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have a safe product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the product... And I think a
lot of people that were using things like
[SPEAKER_04]: Avid, most of those people are gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have businesses anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not familiar with it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew at 96 to 06, and then I got out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all this new stuff, I'm just...
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting re-educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all kinds of stuff that you can
spray to... It's like spraying Roundup on
[SPEAKER_04]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't spray Roundup on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God you can't put it on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot that you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, because you have to grow in a
sterile environment, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So technically you're growing in a sterile
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have a sterile product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't always happen that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you need contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, everyone gets contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing mushrooms, you're never going to
not have contamination at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all it takes is one molecule of
mold, and the whole thing's ruined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of the cannabis folks
that switched over to mushrooms thought it
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to be so super easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, no, no, it's actually much
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's labor-intensive, believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super labor-intensive, making the
grain, harvesting, all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now there's shops you can buy the
grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy whatever substrate you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's multiple types of substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets costly if you're doing it on a
regular basis, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it gets real.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing is the price of mushrooms
since decriminalization has changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone down way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market got flooded just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also see a lot of these commercial
varieties and strains of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that I'm very particular about
what I like, especially if I'm making
[SPEAKER_04]: teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like specifically golden teasers in
larger amounts, because I always feel so
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the penis envy is not my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not mine only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some turkey, these big giant ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're made for yield, and I think
they're made for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as I'm all about effect with
mushrooms at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: for me, it's all about effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it make me feel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it make me feel better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I feel clear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I feel introverted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sometimes I'll feel introverted
and not social at all, and I want to be
[SPEAKER_04]: alone and not want to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I can't talk to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to talk to me, and I can't talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've taken too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taken too much or taken the right amount,
and you're in the wrong environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many varieties of mushrooms,
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to be believed that a cube is a
cube is a cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what it is, it's all just going
to give you the same experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've noticed is that there are some
that don't give you visuals, just body
[SPEAKER_03]: high, and you just feel zen, just calm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are other ones that are
hyper-visual and not social.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more for somebody that's trying to
do meditation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then penis envy is natural LSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 5X strength-wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 to 3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like for Golden Teachers,
it's a 5X.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Golden Teachers is like the beginner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the training wheels.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I like Thai kubenzis, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are great, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like those a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Golden Teachers just always make
me feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: To that a lot of times, because I love the
good feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the penis envies is like,
even though 0.1 microdose doesn't feel
[SPEAKER_04]: like a microdose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's genuinely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it hard to believe when people are
like, I'm going to microdose on penis
[SPEAKER_03]: envy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's just very rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some gummies from Michael Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, oh, there's 250
milligrams in each gummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the beginning of a journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's not a microdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a microdose.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like a gram of penis envy feels like an
eighth of a lot of other mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And an eighth of penis envy feels like the
craziest hero dose you've ever taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like 9 to 12 grams of regular one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one guy come to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I warned him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I warned him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, don't take more than a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always start small, because you can always
take more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't take less.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can staircase it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just feel it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: His friends were like, no, she's just
pumping you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like any other mushroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took the whole 3.5 grams and sat on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said the only thing he could say
for hours was the entities, the entities,
[SPEAKER_03]: the entities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, well, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he came back and told me about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, you know, it was honestly the
most beautiful experience of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll be a while before I do mushrooms
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't blame you at that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and so I call it the full melt
experience, where you get it from DMT.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the first time I had it was from
nitrous oxide, which is very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone down different paths than a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in Oakland off 880, there's a pottery
shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knows the pottery shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was a rave back in maybe 90
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone had a tank in the VIP room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend was the one throwing the
party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got a big punching ball thing of
nitrous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a big like beanbag chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I decided to go, I was like,
that looks like a big, perfect chair to go
[SPEAKER_04]: sit and suck on this balloon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big nitrous guy now or anything,
but I did it then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got this full melt experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how long I was gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like very DMT, very DMT like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know how long I was gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came back, tried to gather all my
friends around because I want to explain
[SPEAKER_04]: everything, because I understood
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second I tried to start putting it
into words, you can't verbalize where you
[SPEAKER_04]: go or what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end, all I could say is we're
all going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's stuck with me through life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like one of those life changing
things where it's like, we're all going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be OK no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happens here, whatever happens to
us, on this plane, we're all going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was my big takeaway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm lucky I got that at a very young
age, because I've always felt like I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been a fuck up part of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done stupid stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done a lot of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one takeaway is that we're all
going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if everybody felt that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much better could the world be?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've felt that in Cuba when I was
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've felt that a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That it was a feeling of just living day
by day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you didn't have any worries about
where your food's coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very by the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never experienced that anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barcelona is the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Florence is too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents were in Florence this last
couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every place in the world, there's
something I know I want to try food wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Roman pizza, the square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Detroit pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, Roman pizza.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ingredients they use are just
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the bread in Europe is so different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it agrees with my stomach
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grain here doesn't agree with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like over in Europe, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with the tomatoes for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had acid reflux so bad, couldn't eat
tomato sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Italy, I can eat tomato sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day, no problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they use a lot of tomatoes in Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And tomatoes are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like growing my own tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite things to grow
besides cannabis.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they grow similar in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we used to tell the hydro
stores we were growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to come talk about tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd be like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Berkeley in our garden, you could not go
in there to talk to somebody unless you
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about tomatoes or vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to be in code.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the 90s, it was such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'd be funny because you'd be in the
store and then every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: someone would come in and they'd slip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd have angry people working at the
place that wouldn't want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't talk to people like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the name of the grocery
shop in North Hollywood, but they would
[SPEAKER_03]: get so mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old guys back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say that.
Grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then All Seasons opened up in
Chatsworth and those guys are still
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they were my go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to have to go in a black hoodie,
park down the street so that your license
[SPEAKER_03]: plates wouldn't get photographed by law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were with their binoculars,
recording everyone's license plates back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were so separated from that world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of people that
are involved with today's cannabis economy
[SPEAKER_04]: that have no idea really what went on.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how illegal it was, for even small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a six-lighter, you could get in big
trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just had one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had one light.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I grew 100 to 200 colas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea of green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea of green, real small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mini forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: You basically would flip right when you
got the clowns.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you go for the clowns?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I grew from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got seeds from Mark Emery and then
had mothers because it was really
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to get seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to get them from Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they would make it and sometimes
they wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I had mothers always in the- I
signed his magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got his number from there and then-
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is before email even.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is before email.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you had to send an SAE.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: SASE, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: SASE, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strange world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, before email, how would you
communicate?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, there was addresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't have a phone number,
you could write someone a letter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the phone book.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Yellow Pages are the Yellow Pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a book that had all of everybody's
phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I don't even know what the Yellow
Pages look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything is on- I do know what
it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yellowpages.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, save some paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a scary time growing in the 90s,
especially in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in San Fernando Valley and I grew
in apartment buildings, like one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: bedrooms, just blown out and slept in the
living room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they have carbon filters back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they just came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had just come out of the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I remember when they first came
out and they didn't really work all that
[SPEAKER_04]: well in my garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't work that well back then
either.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole apartment complex smelled like
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiple people were growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kept my day job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a nanny or I was working at the
preschool and my ex was in construction,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we didn't drive flashy cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You blame it on the weird neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, just roll over you then.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, but nobody knew it was us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we would come and go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally not fit the profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, maybe it's the Russians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's the stupid kids down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's the Israelis on the top floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never assumed that it was us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Serbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely the Serbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's so crazy how people think
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was absolutely dangerous and nobody
would dare call the police or anything
[SPEAKER_03]: because the only people that were really
growing were people that were really ready
[SPEAKER_03]: to die for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was super dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was a time where one of the
gangs found out that we were growing and
[SPEAKER_03]: luckily we were on the other side of the
street, so our zip code was not in their
[SPEAKER_03]: territory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had to stay out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd wake up every night with a loaded 45,
waiting to get executed by some gang that
[SPEAKER_03]: may come through the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when you realize- Over a one
lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over a one lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a one light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a Phototron.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my first indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was with a Phototron.
[SPEAKER_04]: From High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in the back of High Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: High Times magazine was really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was where I got my
inspiration from as a kid at a very young
age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably too young for some parents to
want their kids to be into that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there was worse things to
inspire to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the generation of faces of death.
[SPEAKER_03]: BHS going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's so much stuff that was worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Faces of death.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the bum fights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been accused of- This is a funny
rumor.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been- Not about bum fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shouldn't laugh because- Me either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been funny rumors that have
been spread about me over the years,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the rumors was I got my money
from bum fights that I was the original
[SPEAKER_04]: investor in bum fights.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's funny hearing these rumors and
then people are like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember hearing that about you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like it had nothing to do with
bum fights whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whoever came up with that is super
creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's funny, but not true at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's always rumors about people
where it's like- Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People told a rumor that I- In high school
that I died at one point and it was only
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'd gone off the radar and I was
living in LA growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that I got run over by a train
and I was like, oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm still alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a friend that I had thought he died
in Desert Storm and for 20 years I thought
[SPEAKER_04]: he was dead and then he appeared on
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, fuck, he's not dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I used to party at his house all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd been feeling bad about this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to laugh or anything, but it's funny
how rumors happen and then social media
[SPEAKER_04]: exacerbates it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social media is so gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the level of egos that we get out
of the cannabis industry over a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: tens of thousands of followers,
it's just wild to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's spend a lot of our- I just
posted it the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's spend a lot of our time every
day arguing with people we know about
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the thing is, it's the most
amazing, beautiful, and disgusting thing
[SPEAKER_04]: all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really how you use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like it can be used.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tool just like anything else,
but it can be abused.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be used incorrectly and it can
basically feed your ego and make you think
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, God or whatever, think you're
different than who you really are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we just need to be grounded and
realize that we're all- One guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I told him that we're all equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, we're all equal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, well, that's like giving
participation awards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's not what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're all equal on a spiritual
level.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all equal on a physical level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could talk about as far as
like participation awards being a bad
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we live in this world where
participation awards.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as us being equal, men and
women, being equal, it doesn't matter what
[SPEAKER_04]: race, what color, what sex, any of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that we should all be
treated equal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have a right to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all born here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's a big problem is
that a lot of people start thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: they're better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm a better grower or I'm a better
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of that stuff really matters at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm better than anybody and nobody's
better than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as long as you can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something my father really
instilled from a young age is you're not
[SPEAKER_04]: better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also nobody's better than you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the more you can think like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we want to strive to be
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to strive to be better ourselves,
not better than other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where it gets lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is like, even though you're competing in
whatever you're competing, really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just competing against yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you're on a team, you're just
trying to do the best you can do to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: better person every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully over time, you become a lot
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There needs to be a lot of humbling in the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Psychedelics will do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Psychedelics will do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do more mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last like year and a half,
like with being a fly on the wall and
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some networking in the cannabis
industry, I was really kind of appalled.
[SPEAKER_03]: The level of misogyny, just the bullying,
the online bullying.
[SPEAKER_03]: The online bullying is silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't middle school guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but the thing is is so, I mean,
I try to look at it from the outside,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there is a lot of bullying.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people that try to bully me
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in the real world, you never bully
me, but you want to try to do it online,
[SPEAKER_04]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, is like, I understand
that those people have trauma that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: gone through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of those people were probably bullied
when they were in school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now they're online and they're
like, I'm going to get this guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, the stuff doesn't affect me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that sometimes it does actually,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it bothers me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're human.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're human.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I try to be grateful for all I
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I try to live in gratitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's so important is living
in gratitude to be grateful for what you
[SPEAKER_04]: have and not worry about what you don't
have as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think we can strive to be
better or we can strive to do amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's nothing out of reach if we
want it, but what we really have to be
[SPEAKER_04]: grateful for what we have, because we
don't know how long we're going to be here
[SPEAKER_04]: and we don't know how long we have to do
all these great things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all this stuff is finite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and psychedelics kind of really
have opened me up to that, to where I
[SPEAKER_04]: realized that like we have a limited time
to do great things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a limited time to tell the people
that we care about that we love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, little things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are the beautiful things in life
when you can be grateful for what you have
[SPEAKER_04]: and wake up and go, fuck, this is pretty
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could all be gone in a heartbeat,
but right now it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people would spend more time focused on
their own projects and pushing out the
[SPEAKER_03]: best that they can with their own projects
instead of creating unnecessary drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being worried about other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working together, working together as a
collaborative, you know, effort in the
[SPEAKER_03]: community, they would get so much further
as opposed to just this race to the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the future, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there will be the, in the cannabis
scene especially, there is the race to the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom, but along that line where we have
this race to the bottom, where it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: down, we have collaboration coming in,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the ones who collaborate are going
to be successful.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes a team.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also, it's just the next evolution
because when we were growers in the 90s
[SPEAKER_04]: and in the early 2000s, we had to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were an electrician, you were a
carpenter, you made extract a lot,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I made extract, I did growing,
I did trimming, I did it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you start getting into a more
advanced situation where, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, I can just focus on this and then I
can have an extractor and I can have
[SPEAKER_04]: trimmers and I can, all these things over
time change and evolve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just feel like the next evolution
is going to be collaboration, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: because you can work within a network of
good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether it's companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding those good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, but if you're in the industry long
enough, you start finding people that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can attach yourself to that have a good
reputation, that do good work because
[SPEAKER_04]: although I feel like we've weeded all the
bad people out, that's never the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always going to be bad people that
somehow are able to get in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I weeded most of them out a
long time ago, but still we get snakes in
[SPEAKER_04]: the grass coming in, posing as something
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you realize, oh man, that person
isn't who you perceive them to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of what we see in this
reality is just perception.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not always reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what you perceive is an individual
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a shared experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a shared reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once people realize that, then you
start to share your perceptions and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can come to an understanding and you
communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can share your different
perceptions and come together and
[SPEAKER_03]: community that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And community is so powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really genuinely is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been blessed to find a lot of
really great people in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, people that are passionate about
the plant, people that want to push it
[SPEAKER_03]: forward in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the right reasons, like the
Regenerative Farmers Guild event that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing on June 22nd.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a monthly event and we're
pulling the best farmers from the mountain
[SPEAKER_03]: that are just about the plant,
about preserving the plant, about pushing
[SPEAKER_03]: the best genetics forward, about creating
a future for their children, for
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves and for the people around them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about an ego.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about I did this or that or the
other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that matter 10 years from now,
20 years from now, 30 years from now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 8 billion people in this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people know you by name?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're insignificant in the grand scheme
of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a collective effort, as a
collective consciousness, that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: beauty of all of this is the collective
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we all just play a role in the
greater collective consciousness of
[SPEAKER_04]: existence is how I feel from what I've
seen and what I've experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can get rid of ego and realize that
we're all just a part of something so much
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger than ourselves that we can't even
fully comprehend, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think when people grasp that and
fully delve into that experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: it humbles people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you get humbled on that level,
then you start to see that you have a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of work to do within yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you start working on yourself,
then you can help other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's never over.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's something you strive for
and it's something that you have to work
[SPEAKER_04]: out on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the second you feel like you know
it all, you're so far away from any sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scared of people who say they know
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends that think they know
everything too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they need more psychedelics,
for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need more psychedelics and they need
to read more.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one person can understand all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be good at everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you work hard at one thing,
you can be really good at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can be a master.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can be a master.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't take natural born skill
always.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times, repetition is what's going
to make you successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing up for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consistency, the repetition,
the practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and that's what I learned as a
child.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom's Korean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about piano lessons, violin
lessons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Repetition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Repetition every day, every day to get
better and better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's with anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what life's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell me more about the church.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I founded this church to create a safe
space and a haven for plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And under that umbrella, it includes
psilocybin, DMT, cacti outside of peyote,
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: People use these products or sacraments to
heal themselves for spiritual purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my goal is to have the cleanest plant
medicine available to people so that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can find that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, I would like to be able to
get to a position where we can subsidize
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine for people on the streets of
Oakland to help them get off opioids and
[SPEAKER_03]: methamphetamines and hard drugs in the
street so that they can reverse their
[SPEAKER_03]: lives back to a path that is one that they
got derailed from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, most of the psychedelics are still a
schedule one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially musher, psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically psilocybin because the VA is
working with veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: For PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: For PTSD, you have people in the
pharmaceutical industry that are working
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have academia that's working on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of research that's going
into it that is behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just a party drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a healing mechanism for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a healing mechanism for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the church, do you guys have
church sessions throughout the week?
[SPEAKER_04]: You were telling me about an event that's
going on on the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the Regenerative Farmers Guild
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 30 farmers that are coming down
from Humboldt and Mendocino to share
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, clones, flour, and education.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim Blake is coming to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some hash makers that are joining
as well to talk about the benefits of hash
[SPEAKER_03]: and educate people on the different
qualities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But mainly we support plant medicine in
all different communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a woman who comes to do a 5-MeO
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that and we have neuroscientists and
psychiatrists and psychologists that come
[SPEAKER_03]: through to do integration and they teach
people how to take medicine on a microdose
[SPEAKER_03]: and integrate it into their lives and talk
about the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're talking 5-MeO for people
that aren't familiar that are watching the
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast and they're hearing it for the
first time, are we talking about a Bufo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Toad venom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she's a spiritual healer.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a ceremony holder.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has extensive experience in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not a spiritual healer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I pass that off to people who have the
expertise in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the San Pedro, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another one that will get your
stomach turning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a guy who's a cacti expert who
comes through and does vending and he
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to do a class on grafting and talk
about extraction and all the benefits of
[SPEAKER_03]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the funny thing is San Pedro is one of
those ones where you see it growing
[SPEAKER_04]: randomly in Berkeley and Oakland,
you know, like driving by people's houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's these big San Pedro cactus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get it at Home Depot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, people don't even know they have
it going and you got that magic growing
[SPEAKER_04]: right in their front yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a cool looking plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, cactus just in general is amazing.
Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, our main focus is mushrooms just
because that's where my expertise is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do provide genetics and grow kits and
teach people how to grow their own
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine because it's not just about being
a dispensary model.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're more of like a community
space where we give education and we want
[SPEAKER_03]: people to be able to do it on their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if someone wants to come to church on
Sunday, we all have events every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it every day or you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have like two or three days a week we
have events.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have an event called Dabs and
Doodles, which is we open up the doors for
[SPEAKER_03]: free to street artists, graffiti artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come and share hash and we'll have a
couple of vendors and it's just a very
[SPEAKER_03]: chill environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those graffiti artists, those writers all
like smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems not all of them because we had
the luminaries and only one out of three
[SPEAKER_04]: guys actually smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the ones I know, a lot of them like
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like mushrooms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Raws and mushrooms too, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had an event with the Lord's crew
and so they painted the auxiliary
[SPEAKER_03]: building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did an art show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a lot of things that are
community based.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so church is- Counterculture,
community based.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotta love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just getting the message of what mushrooms
do out there and maybe a less than
[SPEAKER_03]: orthodox way, but I don't focus on just
one subset of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this isn't just for the 1% that can
afford like a $15,000 ceremony.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for everybody and we're losing
people in all communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's sad that it's been
commercialized, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's my feeling is that part of
it is sad that it's been commercialized to
[SPEAKER_04]: where people feel they have to go away for
the healing and maybe there has been a
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit to that and I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think Burning Man has kind of
changed too over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went a long, long time ago and it was
completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that there's anything wrong and I
don't know because I haven't gone,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I see people flying in jets and
helicopters, like especially helicopters
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's like that was never a thing 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then ayahuasca ceremonies were
probably your flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you pretty much had to pay for
it because everything else was so
[SPEAKER_04]: inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's a commercial business and so
they've commercialized the healing and not
[SPEAKER_04]: that there's anything wrong with
commercializing stuff, but I feel like you
[SPEAKER_04]: take away part of the magic too with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes it so that only very few
people have access to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you take away access and that's
where you lose the magic because it's for
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for everybody and that's why I think
it's awesome that Oregon decriminalized
[SPEAKER_03]: statewide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're reversing that by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's crazy that they did that to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great that they did it in
some ways, but meth, being able to possess
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs like meth or even small amounts,
like I think those things need to be off
[SPEAKER_04]: the streets personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any value in meth or heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fentanyl, there's no value in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and it takes away from society.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't help people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It destroys lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And psilocybin is proven to help reverse
that crisis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it makes the world a better place,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a handful, cannabis makes
the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I love about it is that it
makes the world a better place and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: things that contribute to making society
better and there's things that take away
[SPEAKER_04]: from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that these hard drugs,
they take away from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that Oregon just went across
the board and said, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: everything for possession is okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about putting people in jail
that are addicts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe that's not the solution,
but I think therapy and treatment and
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need solutions for those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So homeless solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the biggest problems is our
homeless problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Solving that, I don't know what the answer
is because everybody's like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's so complicated that there's
not just one answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us a long time to get to this
point where we have tents in Oakland on
[SPEAKER_04]: bridges.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's communities of homeless people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took us a long time to get to this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents were friends with a guy who
basically starved himself to make a point
[SPEAKER_04]: for months and months and months to bring
attention to the fact that it was all
[SPEAKER_04]: mentally ill people.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of people that are homeless
are mentally ill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say that that's still the
case, but it's not all the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rough time out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't have enough solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of countries that have
solutions for homeless people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were talking about Cuba.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see homeless people in Cuba,
Scandinavian countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have solutions for these things and
they're thought of because the government
[SPEAKER_04]: cares about their people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to think that people in our
government care about people, but as a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough to look at our government
saying that they care about people and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you see people homeless in Oakland
and San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think there's politicians that
care.
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly do think there are good
politicians and bad politicians,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's not just bad across the board,
but it's perception.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you're going down the street
in Oakland, it's hard to think good about
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody as any sort of day on anything
when there's people living in tents in the
[SPEAKER_04]: communities and there's people getting
robbed and beaten and killed in Oakland in
[SPEAKER_04]: the streets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Oakland's the worst it's ever been
that I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least in my lifetime as an adult,
it's honestly the roughest it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I volunteered for two years with Punks
with Lunch, which is a nonprofit that my
[SPEAKER_03]: friend Alejandra started almost eight
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every Sunday we would go out and do
harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meals and clothing and hygiene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two years, it took a toll on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started volunteering, it was at the
beginning of gentrification in West
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the beginning, you would just see
mostly people addicted to drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: mental health issues, runaways,
kids that got misplaced after the foster
[SPEAKER_03]: care system, let them go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then over those two years,
you started seeing families.
[SPEAKER_03]: You started seeing like working parents
with kids living in tents because they got
[SPEAKER_03]: evicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the economy that's the catalyst to
all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lack of healthcare, the lack of
education, the lack of just living,
[SPEAKER_03]: just a living wage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody can live off of $15 an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Oakland?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and 15 isn't worth what 15 was before.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at the value of the dollars
depreciated so much over the period.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the houses are more, I mean,
they're more expensive, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not like they're worth more.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because the value of the dollar is
much less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we haven't matched the salaries
because you used to be able to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: janitor in the fifties and sixties and you
could still earn a living wage and buy a
[SPEAKER_04]: house off of that salary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just changed so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to think that it's getting
better, but I feel like it's still going
[SPEAKER_04]: to get worse before it gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the economy has to change first
and we need to provide basic services for
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I feel like the economy goes up
and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what, we're going to have a
better economy and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a worse economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just going to fluctuate
throughout time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, there's not enough awareness of
reality and what happened over the last 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years is the middle classes got away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we look at where we're at right now
and you're on one spectrum of the others.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of people that are just
happily living in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're either pushed towards the upper or
you're pushed towards the lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a big struggle.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big struggle for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't blame people for robbing
and stealing when they can't provide for
[SPEAKER_03]: their families off of a basic wage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what would you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think there's opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference though, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're stealing because you're
hungry and you're stealing food,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's very different than if you're an
opportunist and you're going with your
[SPEAKER_04]: friends to Rob Nordstrom and steal as much
clothes as you can so you can steal them
[SPEAKER_04]: off the streets or you're breaking into
people's cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, there's a separation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The opportunists, I think those people are
not doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if my family was starving,
I would do whatever it took to feed them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a very different
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's not a one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why it's so hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, well, what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many steps and so many things
that have to happen over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even when I was volunteering,
like trying to think of like, what's the
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's daunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like where do you begin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you even begin?
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts with people just helping each
other in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts with people who have to start
helping people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts with compassion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compassion and empathy and just
understanding that it's very possible for
[SPEAKER_03]: you to end up in their shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when people get that into perspective
and you start humanizing the people on the
[SPEAKER_03]: street, as opposed to seeing them as
throwaway people and understanding that
[SPEAKER_03]: they are people's family, they are
people's loved ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And start to treat them that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It changes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess that's the beauty of
living in Oakland is the exposure too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it puts the world into
perspective, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is that the one thing constant
is change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not going to stay the same no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're changing and evolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: People thought I was going to be easy
money in the cannabis industry forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought it was going to be easy money
in the mushroom pit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought it was going to be easy
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was for the people in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some people that crushed it,
but that was a very short window.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say the real reason why I
wasn't excited to get into mushrooms is
[SPEAKER_04]: because I realized when I take mushrooms,
if I take a big dose, I don't want to take
[SPEAKER_04]: it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoke weed every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll puff on some.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I go home, I smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas mushrooms, I do selectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the period of the last 33 years,
I've done it in waves throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never been a constant, even when I
did the micro dosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it has a ceiling to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas cannabis can at least keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a ceiling to the amount
of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we still haven't reached that
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a long time before you
reach it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because of awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the more people that are aware of it,
the more people that will try it and
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you tap into what those outcomes
are as far as PTSD and brain trauma and
[SPEAKER_03]: those physical things that are going on in
your brain and knowing that the medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: really helps you in that way, getting that
word out to more and more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are 273, 275 million people
in the world or in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 273 last time I checked,
but it's been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 350 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll check that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll fact check that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll fact check that one totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of people who would take
mushrooms and not take and not smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because if you're taking it like
a vitamin for medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as a vitamin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that, but also cannabis,
we were still exploring the use for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think plant medicine is we're just
scratching the surface of it and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going back, you know, and this is a long
time coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I think it's going to go back to a
lot of plant based medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to look at stuff and go,
this is actually better and more suitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has less side effects, way less
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think it'll be custom
tailored to just we know of all these
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and we know of all these
terpenes and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: flavorants and other things and how they
work with the entourage effect together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: The surface on how do we apply this
medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're the best part of changing the
scheduling to schedule three is now we can
[SPEAKER_04]: do more research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so once they go from schedule one with
psilocybin to schedule two or three or
[SPEAKER_04]: four or whatever they change it to,
we'll be able to do even more research and
[SPEAKER_04]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where they start finding the
magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where they start finding,
OK, well, this works great for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we've solved the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: My fear with that, though, is that
pharmaceutical companies will take over
[SPEAKER_03]: and control it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's but I try not to live in
fear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so my biggest thing is like because I'm
always scared of that with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry that I know what's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what's coming with plant patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what's coming with pharmaceutical
standards and not just GMP, but like ISO
[SPEAKER_04]: standards and stuff like that,
especially when we're talking about labs
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but even just standard GMP products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's still a process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people aren't ready for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there will be people that lose.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still going to have farmers
farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the ones that are in now,
I feel like there's we had Ridgeline Farms
[SPEAKER_04]: and we had Huckleberry Hill Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those guys are great examples of two
of the several companies that I see moving
[SPEAKER_04]: into the market in the future and
expanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once interstate commerce goes,
they can start growing and sharing their
[SPEAKER_04]: product with people all around the United
States, because we're so limited with rec
[SPEAKER_04]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that excites me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so even though there is like a little
bit of fear of the pharmaceutical takeover
[SPEAKER_04]: and how that's going to impact us,
I'm not as worried about that when I see
[SPEAKER_04]: guys like Johnny from Huckleberry Hill
Farms who has a cultivar that makes you
[SPEAKER_04]: feel absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we got Jason from Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got the latest and greatest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's doing mixed light.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also doing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But his mixed light stuff is comparable to
indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're evolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens with the pharmaceutical
industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're going to try to take,
they want to take, people want to take
[SPEAKER_04]: over.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it's the human nature to want
to own it.
[SPEAKER_04]: To want to take it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: To all be mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the human nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the human nature in people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to get away from that a little
bit and trying to share more.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's American.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very American.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very American.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very Texan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have one of the biggest,
the best, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that is ego.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could kill a little bit of that ego,
the world would be a better place,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think the other thing is we live
in excess in the United States,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see it in Europe quite as much,
although we are definitely influencing
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more overweight people in Europe
than there ever has been.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's fast food restaurants all over
Europe too now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got the Nikes and they got the
influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like everything goes in waves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go through this and then
we're going to go through good periods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of stuff skips
generations too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like hard workers, sometimes parents
are really hard workers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to work so hard that they're
kids have an easy life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not necessarily the good way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then their kids are going to have
an easy life, but they might not have
[SPEAKER_04]: money for their kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So their kids are going to have to suffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it skips a generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then their kids become hard workers
and so on and so forth forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what is this saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough men create easy times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then easy times create weak men.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then weak men create hard times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hard times create tough men.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that pattern, like many things,
it's a pattern that goes on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go through these fluctuations,
just like the economy going up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went away from plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went away from hemp, which is the
silliest thing in the whole world,
[SPEAKER_04]: that we went away from hemp as a society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hemp is so valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we turned onto things like cotton,
which is not nearly as eco-friendly,
[SPEAKER_04]: nearly as strong and durable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we as a society went away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, that's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you look 100 years in the past
or 100 years in the future, they'd be
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you guys were nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys really screwed up on that one,
among other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one by itself is just like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really screwed up on the hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we fed corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we feed all the cattle corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think before we were feeding a lot
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're talking about cannabinoids
possibly being in the milk that we drank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have all these autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's a relation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's definitely something going on
with the nutrition that we get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the nutrition has dropped
significantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the companies that have been
patenting just corn and soybeans and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of our basic vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Putting seed oils and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just with the patents came control and
lack of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've lost a lot of species of
corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have four types of tomatoes in the
store.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that, bananas, we have two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a huge contributing factor to
the lack of nutrition in the food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try not to talk about scary things or
fear-based models.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you have the knowledge of the
biopiracy that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the patenting of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that control being in the hands of
very few people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have people with boots on the
ground that are working against that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And preserving genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And preserving the diversity of all
different kinds of plants and species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the future of life on
Earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Future of our children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our children's children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what Americans don't generally
think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is generational.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think of me right now and when I die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who's going to take care of me when I
die.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is generational wealth to a small
percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at other countries,
the generational wealth is much bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where stuff is passed down through
multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Asia especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Italy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have a lot of homeless people in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the properties are all passed to
their children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And homes stay in the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not how it happens here in the US
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bass ackwards.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Common sense isn't common anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there's people, we're talking
about it today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least there's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least we recognize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fact that we're talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our ancestors, they would be proud.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess the two people that you really
need to make proud in your life are your
[SPEAKER_04]: 18 year old self and your 80 year old
self.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can do that, you're doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my 18 year old self is super stoked on
everything I've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: My 80 year old self, we're working on that
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I make it to 80, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: My 18 year old self is like, yeah it makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was 18 I had tons of high times
magazines and I was all about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that I'm here now is just a
blessing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one last question before you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was one piece of advice for your
younger self that you would give your
[SPEAKER_04]: younger self now, after all you've
experienced, what would that one thing be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't trust everyone so easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And go with your intuition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't stop being generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't trust despite people being negative
or being bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my 18 year old self would just say
to be careful who you trust and choose
[SPEAKER_03]: your friends wisely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody has different answers and we
get so much stuff and I feel like we're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna have a show of just the answers of
what people would tell their younger
[SPEAKER_04]: selves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the collective consciousness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure people have said some,
I don't know, I can't even imagine what
[SPEAKER_03]: other people would think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Save your money.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Save your money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do so many drugs so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all gonna be okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always bounce back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humans are resilient.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always bounce back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will always bounce back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually when you bounce back,
you bounce back higher than you were
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is about lessons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the biggest.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I think that's the biggest is
don't ever be afraid to fail because if
[SPEAKER_04]: you wanna be successful, you're gonna keep
failing and you're gonna keep getting up
[SPEAKER_04]: and doing it and then show up for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the other big one is show
up for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wish more kids could hear that,
that sometimes you don't like doing stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: but to be good at something, you have to
do it a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to practice over and over in
natural born talent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not always gonna get you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But dedication to something is what it's
all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And commitment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people are interested in finding out
more about you, where can they go?

[SPEAKER_00]: On mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be laughing the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds good.
