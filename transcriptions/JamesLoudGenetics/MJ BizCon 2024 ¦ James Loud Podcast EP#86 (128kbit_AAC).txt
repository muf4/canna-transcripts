[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: James Loud here, MJ Biz 2024.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with amazing brands like Kaya
Coco, United, Hygrozyme, Greengrows
[SPEAKER_07]: Biologic, United.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're here at the GrowWorld Connect
Community booth sharing our information.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got some amazing lectures here on
the stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here filming some stuff and telling
people about genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got our books and seeds for sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's looking like it's going to be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Terrence and Philip,
the Cannabis Brothers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to do high times events together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here over a decade later at MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing good, James.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys gave me some of your flowers,
some of your rosin, some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: that's going to be hit in the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for sharing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just hit the market two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm back on the California market.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been on the market out there for
about a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we've been doing Australia's up
next.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're excited about that one.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Antigua?
[SPEAKER_11]: Antigua.
[SPEAKER_11]: My sister was out there doing some
projects.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but we're really concentrating on
California, Canada, and Australia.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then you guys, we're doing a
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got some Wi-Fi, ZBX.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, off the hook.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those seeds are really good, so hopefully
you guys can get a little sample of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to do a collaboration
seed release.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to be able to show the people the
flower, and then we'll do the seed release
[SPEAKER_07]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really pumped about these new
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new phenotypes that we've selected are
off the hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be proud.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you guys for your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys are going to be on the
podcast really soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Checking everything out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Thomas, the Grandmaster LED,
Heston Alcorn.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are both in on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great people.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first experience here,
having a really good time getting to meet
[SPEAKER_02]: people I've known for a decade,
but never met in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Heston, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great experience to make these
relationships online and never get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: them in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole group coming together,
good guys, good people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good people from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada, United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Arian here from, you know,
just in plain sight.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got people from like 30 different
countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fair is also really incredible here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to give it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you seem to keep selling out of the
lights, the UVCs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just keep on making more and shipping
them every single month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just been going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been really, really busy and it's
been really making a big difference for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually really easy to install.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like I like the concept.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like if you can limit the amount of
spray you put on your place, you're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to get a better product to the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything I can do to minimize the amount
of spraying we do, especially in flour,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly believe in two years from now,
like if they will be like more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial growers, like in a few years,
all will be using it because it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: such a disadvantage not to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it will be an industry standard,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't see why people wouldn't
want to switch in transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as time is going, we're actually
getting more and more SOPs for fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: different bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we weren't advertising that it's
really effective against rude if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: originally, but now we got data showing
that rude if it's are attracted to it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they land right on it and get nipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the flying one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are really evolving each day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heston, you've been to MJ before,
yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your first time, too?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are MJ virgins.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you guys for your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Talk about power.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got James Loud literally hitting 100
pushups right now on the trade show floor.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have never seen this in my life.
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's cooking the dinner tonight.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's just got to work up an appetite.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is impressive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do not fuck with James Loud.
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a beast.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_13]: He told me he's like, are you guys ready
to wake up at 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_13]: and do a cold plunge?
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, Absolutely not, James.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will be sleeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: After day one, I hosted the Loud and
Legendary dinner with my good friend,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ricky Cruz, who is the executive chef at
the win.
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose for the dinner was to get
everyone together and show my appreciation
[SPEAKER_04]: for the friends in the industry.
Hey,
[SPEAKER_12]: what's going on, everyone?
[SPEAKER_12]: Sergio Picasso here from the Kinect
community, coming to you from the Loud and
[SPEAKER_12]: Legendary dinner with Chef James Loud and
Chef Ricky Cruz.
[SPEAKER_12]: This collaborative dinner marks the first
installment of the Gas and Candy Battle
[SPEAKER_12]: Royale, where every flower entry is judged
across three key categories, aroma,
[SPEAKER_12]: smoothness and taste.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had an incredible 28 entries combined.
[SPEAKER_12]: A huge thank you to all the cultivators
who showed up to compete for the strap.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Battle Royale isn't just a
competition.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an opportunity for cultivators to
connect, learn and level up together,
[SPEAKER_12]: because in this arena, the cultivators are
the judges.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: No, seriously, guys, we wouldn't be here
without the support and the love from
[SPEAKER_16]: everybody here to connect.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all here about 580 and leveling up.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this shit wouldn't be real unless you
guys are here, because we had enough kind
[SPEAKER_16]: cater to go around and the support that we
have from our partners.
[SPEAKER_16]: So everybody, thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever you got in the air, throw it up.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a joint.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a treat.
[SPEAKER_16]: Salute to all you guys.
Welcome,
[SPEAKER_14]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are here back on day two of MJ Fizz
2024.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have such a special podcast today.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you know this,
Ariane, but nine years ago, I was watching
[SPEAKER_14]: Strain Hunters and that inspired me to
create Canada Crips.
[SPEAKER_14]: And here we are today with Railroad Tools.
[SPEAKER_10]: And head the African coach, Musa Lodi.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: And James prepared an incredible dinner
last night.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you guys for being here today.
[SPEAKER_14]: But without further ado, James Loud and
Ariane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're here to talk about vertical
integration and international scaling
[SPEAKER_07]: today with Ariane Roskam from Greenhouse
Seed Camp, Strain Hunters, Powder Feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the most awarded cannabis company in
history known for strains like Super
[SPEAKER_07]: Silver Haze, Super Lemon Haze,
Flower Bomb Kush, White Widow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the list goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a big inspiration for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been in 2012.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think if there's anyone
that knows vertical integration and
[SPEAKER_07]: international scaling, it's Ariane.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to talk about Thailand
since that's the latest project.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how's everything going in Thailand?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're happy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you went from Amsterdam and the
Netherlands with the coffee shot model,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you expanded onto parts of Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we went first to Canada with Canopy
a while, and that didn't work out because
[SPEAKER_10]: they had other priorities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're still in Africa,
small, but also we're still waiting there
[SPEAKER_10]: for export license.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's quite complicated, which is like
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it was also five years ago,
impossible in Canada when everything just
stopped.
[SPEAKER_10]: It started from America.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still impossible because you guys are
not federal here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's only possible from countries like
Colombia, Macedonia, Portugal,
[SPEAKER_10]: and now Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's only four countries really
legal, which is Canada, Malta,
[SPEAKER_10]: Uruguay and Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I'm in like the last 40 years in
Thailand, a lot, Haiko also we're there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know the country quite good.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some great connections there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We decided to build our infrastructure
there, looking at the future of cost price
[SPEAKER_10]: of marijuana and possible to expand
without too many issues as where America,
[SPEAKER_10]: Holland and Canada all totally fucked up
their system.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we decided to find an easier way.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we went to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the landscape is changing over
there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like their political landscape
changes from month to month.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with the new election,
how is that going to change everybody?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look, it's it's kind of medical,
you know, growers should be GST and it's
[SPEAKER_10]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to go.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the plan from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the spokesman for many things there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say too much which direction it's
going right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's a thin line there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's we love the country.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for me, I believe this is my 10th
country where I live.
[SPEAKER_10]: I live there now like two years with Haiko
and Yo mostly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look at the country itself,
you know, you look at beaches,
[SPEAKER_10]: you look at food, public transport.
[SPEAKER_10]: Prices crime is hardly any crime in our
country and how nice and kind of people
[SPEAKER_10]: are is probably one of the best countries
in the world to live, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's also a big part of the reason we
thought, OK, you know, let's settle there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also in the north part where we are,
climate is probably maybe the best in the
[SPEAKER_10]: world between August and March.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like now, the nights are between 50 and 20
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_10]: The days are 25 to 30.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a range of options there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So even in the glass nurses, we get
humidity down to 35 percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: So which is great to grow a medical
product because, you know, everything has
[SPEAKER_10]: to be really, really clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's certain and very
important pharmaceutical standards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you cannot export.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys are doing some really large
field hunts there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to touch on that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we had we had the option as nowhere
before when we were working in Congo and
[SPEAKER_10]: South Africa.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of valleys in Congo and
myself and us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had so much seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when Thailand came up,
we were able to get with the Thai FDA to
[SPEAKER_10]: import 300 strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we arrived in Thailand,
the first thing is we did two,
[SPEAKER_10]: three big rounds in total, 147,000 clans.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we went down from 240 to 80
keepers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now is a consistent flow of new stuff
coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's the only place in the
world where you can on a really large
[SPEAKER_10]: scale like Africa, Asia, you can do the
stuff, you know, like if you're a breeder,
[SPEAKER_10]: you need space.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's nice if you do something at
home and you can grow 100 seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, that doesn't really bring
you somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you need to put at least five or
10,000 out, you know, to find some crazy
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is where the new lines are coming
from.
[SPEAKER_10]: So lemon orange, you know, the full gas,
strawberry, nori cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now all these new varieties that are the
follow up of super lemon has all those
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, super blessed to have these
options, you know, these high turpentine
[SPEAKER_10]: profile plants now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with these plants now, we're going to
conquer other markets, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as climate out there,
are you finding some of the genetics that
[SPEAKER_07]: you have traditionally grow really well
out there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, you're on the equator.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the big advantage is that you don't
need any, what do you call this,
[SPEAKER_10]: to make your... No darkness.
[SPEAKER_10]: No dark.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need these curtains,
you know, because we're 6'6 there,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the other hand, if you grow
outside, you have to pregrow your plant
[SPEAKER_10]: unless you put sativas, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we grow mainly for the medical market,
a bunch indoor.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are trying out, you probably saw
that the last year, we hooked up one room
[SPEAKER_10]: with Fluence, one room with Sunlight,
and one room with DLI, and then we still
[SPEAKER_10]: have HPS pads.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see that from all the plants that
we lately did, we didn't yet topish
[SPEAKER_10]: anything yet because we want to do like 10
crops to be sure, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you can already see that under HPS,
much more varieties thrive properly than
[SPEAKER_10]: under LED.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some do better on the LED, but from the
20, there's only like three, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of 5 to 10%, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very low compared both of them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And turps-wise, it's a little bit
different, but it's not better.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_10]: I find that the same, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice turps, but you also have nice
turps on the HPS, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the rest of the facility, we keep
going with HPS.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to move into LED.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're normally in LED.
[SPEAKER_10]: For now, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, because power is so cheap to learn
there.
Quality is better.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, quality is just better.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's a few varieties do
really well.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you look at the buying cost of your
LED and the results, you know the HP is
[SPEAKER_10]: still king.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the United States, we are so concerned
with color right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as color came, these people want
purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: People feel about purple and timing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, these vibes go all around the world,
but they take a year and then it's over
[SPEAKER_10]: again.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then something else comes on.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it's just a trendy thing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Suddenly, everybody want purple and
everybody want this and then everybody
[SPEAKER_10]: want that, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Candied.
[SPEAKER_10]: Candied, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we brought out that candied one with
super remedies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to leave that away on the fair
where we're going to be together next
[SPEAKER_10]: week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or next week or this week?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this Saturday on the 08th.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: The better is so many would we know.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing is what I personally have a big
problem with is all the hydro.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we should all run soil,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really have a big problem with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, taste wise,
nothing can beat soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also health wise, you know,
like what are we putting in there?
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you see this coughing
disease now that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So including my son and my son-in-law have
it quite bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they only have it when they smoke
cardio weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have it when they smoke
European weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it all has to do with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_10]: With this hydro.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we look at our populations right
now, you know, like it's not really good
[SPEAKER_10]: in European and American countries,
the health situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we go to a restaurant, well,
we're both chefs by huge coincidence.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably only yours that we all come
from the background as chef.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are not the restaurants where you eat.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to eat organic food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that tastes much better.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why are we all smoking hydro,
especially in America?
[SPEAKER_10]: Every dispensary I walk in, it's hydro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think part of it is because people
eat with their eyes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and so with cannabis,
the bag appeal and Instagram and the
[SPEAKER_07]: social media, which, you know,
social media is a blessing and a curse,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I feel like it has had negative impact
on the cannabis industry because people so
[SPEAKER_07]: concerned with how it looks, they forgot
the bad, the effect of it and the taste,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think those are the two most
important things that you get over
[SPEAKER_07]: liptiline is effect especially.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because really we're all here for the
effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I think that's part of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you I agree with you there,
but I think the bigger problem is the
[SPEAKER_10]: spreadsheets of Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all these investors that are involved,
you know, and all those growers should
[SPEAKER_10]: push back on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't, you know, because they eat all
70 grams or 60 grams a feet otherwise it's
[SPEAKER_10]: not good, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can only reach that on Rocko.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't reach that on Sawyer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never go to a hydro restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So circling back to Thailand, what are
some of the challenges you faced since you
[SPEAKER_07]: started working in Thailand?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I work with 200 people and none of
them speak English.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of the biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, yeah, just a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, look, here we have an industry
and in Europe we have some kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: industry, but there there was no industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But luckily, I'm in the north,
so I'm in the agriculture area.
[SPEAKER_10]: So most of the women come from the rice
fields and they have some kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: background and they're hard workers.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so but still it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes you have to explain six,
seven, eight, nine times the same thing,
[SPEAKER_10]: which we don't have in Europe or in
America.
[SPEAKER_10]: But lately we figured out, you know,
we make a little video and they'll put it
[SPEAKER_10]: on the phone and then they figure it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So video SOPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Video SOPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: End of discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, and so you have a verting
integrated model, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: impressive because you do the cultivation
and then you also have dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, we opened six dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, next week we're opening the last
one, six.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's five in Bangkok, one in Samui.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really did that to sponsor our own
growth, of course, and create brand
[SPEAKER_10]: awareness in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: People really like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, it's like, you know,
we have five in Amsterdam, we have one in
[SPEAKER_10]: Africa, we have one in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, it's good for our brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd like to hang out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one around the corner where we
live in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you've been there?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, not yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, yeah, you know, it's our hobby.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's not our core business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our core business is seeds and selling GMP
wheat.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's just nice to have those
SOPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'd just like to be the smoking
joint, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in Amsterdam, you know, it came from
the 60s and the 70s.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's the only place in the world where
you see a white guy, a Chinese guy,
[SPEAKER_10]: a black guy and a yellow guy smoking a
joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was very important for the
integration in Amsterdam, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just a social, it's a very well
social aspect place, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: where people integrate with each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think Comshop system is maybe the
best system in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, it's still only in Holland.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have it a little bit in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Thailand, also, we got the boost.
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in, we got the champagne and the
cocktails.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's quite nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week, we're opening the Khor San
Road.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I grew up as a young boy there
when I was 17, 18, 19, growing up in
[SPEAKER_10]: Thailand with a Rosek.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now in that same street, I have a
hotel and a coffee shop, dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's quite funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just came from there, me and Yola.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was nice, eh?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're opening, I think, in 10 days,
wherever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as brand awareness out there,
how do you see consumers purchase
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it based on, like, are they looking for
specific genetics, or are they just
[SPEAKER_05]: looking to eye, or?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look, there's a big, big culture
there in Asia, you know, this golden
[SPEAKER_10]: triangle, yeah?
[SPEAKER_10]: So Thai sticks in the 60s and the 70s to
America.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a famous Thai guy who was 15 years
in a federal prison here and later became
[SPEAKER_10]: minister in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is, like, a quiet awareness about
local strains and also some of the
[SPEAKER_10]: important ones, American strains,
European strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, this is all new also for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's a range of genetics and
the people come in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, there's porter parts that
cannot afford.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's $5 grams.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's a huge tourist industry,
of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, we will hit 35 million
tourists.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the promise we made to the government
is that by 2030, we will have 80 million
[SPEAKER_10]: tourists.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have 45 million to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are your thoughts on Germany in
the new market in Germany?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know for Seeds, you guys have done
really well in Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we do really well in Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a matter of fact, it's one of the
first countries we're going to export our
[SPEAKER_10]: weed to next year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we also have a German company,
an Italian company, and probably somewhere
[SPEAKER_10]: May, June, July next year, we hope,
we're going to export to Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: So and then the reason also we're in
Thailand is that we can keep our costs
[SPEAKER_10]: really low, you know, so we can compete
with the whole world and have the great
[SPEAKER_10]: products.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can have it in a pharmacy where
it's for a very reasonable price,
[SPEAKER_10]: where it can meet the prices of the
streets.
[SPEAKER_10]: So where your mother, my mother,
you know, if they need medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: can walk in and feel safe and get it for a
very reasonable price, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: like for $7, $8, $9 a gram, which is
great, you know, which is even cheaper as
[SPEAKER_10]: in my shop, for example.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you also do seed production in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how has that impacted the company?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we just finished it because we
worked in stages.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we built the first huge Thai indoor to
supply the Thai market.
[SPEAKER_10]: We supply like 200 dispensers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we finalized the GMP, which we are
now finalizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we just build also the Seedcom
company with 26 rooms where we can produce
[SPEAKER_10]: between 100 and 200 kg of flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've got some projects going on
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we'll see next year.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we did the first crop just came
out with seeds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I published it last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got flagged on Instagram, by the way,
for that first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's new?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Social media is just such a blessing and a
curse.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, man, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's molest.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely necessary that they make
it really difficult for people in the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys have navigated fairly well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a huge following in Instagram and
social media.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we have.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we lost a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to have like three, four hundred
million hits with all my grow DVDs.
[SPEAKER_10]: It took that all off.
[SPEAKER_10]: So HICO had a big fight with Google.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the end, he was able to get all the
documentaries back, you know, as
[SPEAKER_10]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we lost all the other views.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other Instagram, we lost a
few times big time.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you look now, I made some pictures.
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably saw the picture of us with
Dua Lipa last week in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even that they flagged.
[SPEAKER_10]: So people are reporting, you know,
like me and Dua Lipa, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's nothing to do with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not even a bud or a joint or a
flower behind us, you know, and they're
[SPEAKER_10]: flagging that kind of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it has probably to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I talk a lot about Palestine, you know,
but kids, only kids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you get some shit for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how do you feel about the United
States and the markets in the United
[SPEAKER_07]: States?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they feel like we're we're a
powerhouse, obviously in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as far as coffee shops in the
future?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look, it's totally surprising that
it's I think there's smokers areas now,
[SPEAKER_10]: but there's no dispensers where you can
live the smoke like Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that will be the perfect thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, unfortunately, things are going
in the wrong direction and in Canada and
[SPEAKER_10]: in America with all these listed
companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the listed companies is a huge
problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going through the figures with
Heiko in Canada and since five,
[SPEAKER_10]: what is it, 2018, 2019, $770 billion got
evaporated.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is all mom and tops investing in
listed companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a huge scandal, you know,
it's really corruptism to the max,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and saying for the American
listed companies, you see people losing
[SPEAKER_10]: three hundred million dollars in three
months, you know, like whereas it should
[SPEAKER_10]: be like in the wine, you know,
there should be few small craft families
[SPEAKER_10]: with their own coffee shop where you feel
comfortable when you go buy it instead of
[SPEAKER_10]: you go into these big chains that grow
hydro wheat and, you know, are listed and
[SPEAKER_10]: making hundreds and millions of loss,
you know, I think it's the wrong
[SPEAKER_10]: direction.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, this is how it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we always have time to change.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think California is starting to get
smoking lounges that just got approved
[SPEAKER_07]: recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by 2025, you should start seeing
smoking consumption lounges in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But with the dispensers where you can buy
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in San Francisco, they already have
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Barbary Coast, there's a couple of
places but it's going to be a lot larger.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that first of all,
my opinion about California is they need
[SPEAKER_07]: the farm to table model where you can
actually go purchase from the farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could purchase the farm to places like
Kabul.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, these places are suffering
because of the industry and taxation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be much easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get a farm tour, taste the
product, have a whole day of it,
[SPEAKER_07]: watch the processing, watch the Coast
Harvest to the Coast Harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that would change the
model.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can do that already.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do that in Holland.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not in Holland because they have a
farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not allowed to come.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in Thailand, yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's from farm to table.
[SPEAKER_10]: And not only that, we grow polyweed,
we grow indoor wheat.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then from the varieties like lemon and
orange, we have the dry shift,
[SPEAKER_10]: we have the pollinator, we have the bubble
hash, we have the rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can have it in six different ways,
for example, which is quite unique,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think if you would adopt a situation
like that in California or in Canada,
[SPEAKER_10]: where there's a farm and where we can buy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have the whole experience,
you know, people will feel more motivated
[SPEAKER_10]: and have a better connection to that
specific dispensary because the same
[SPEAKER_10]: family is growing in whatever organic way,
bringing to the dispensary where you can
[SPEAKER_10]: buy it and where you can use it on site
and have a great time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that will make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can win from chains like
McDonald's and Burger King's that you also
[SPEAKER_10]: want to have in the marijuana thing,
you know, where you lose contact.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where only, yeah, sorry to say,
but where only idiots go to eat,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a real member, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're eating paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a real shitty hammer here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the funny thing is, it's just
like the cannabis industry, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some people that just don't
care.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's other people that want to
consume your best, but they'll tell you to
[SPEAKER_07]: wipe your big.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, look, I like my food,
you know, I want it to be organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to have a full taste like
last night.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great dinner, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to spoil it, you know.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Life is too short to eat one day bad food.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then don't eat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a day.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's better to not eat that you shouldn't
see.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Same thing with weed, though.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're not smoke if it's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with meat.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we should not eat too much meat.
[SPEAKER_10]: That if we eat it, it should be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Circling back to Thailand again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you plan on going next after you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now we're expanding the factory.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're JCP now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Within a few months, we're GMP,
which we're finalizing now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to take another three
months.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then next year, our whole focus is on
export and getting our stuff on the
[SPEAKER_10]: shelves on the right places with the right
people.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the good distribution partners,
you know, which is key.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, and then make more movies,
start branding, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the strain hunters, where are you guys
going next?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a great one coming up.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as you know, we never review where we
go because of security.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one is quite tricky.
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I can say is we're going to
go through the mountains on horses,
[SPEAKER_10]: somewhere very interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have three of them lined up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, strain hunters came 20 years
ago, 2004, 2005.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was called in by the mayor and our
lawyers and they were panicking because in
[SPEAKER_10]: Holland, probably the same in America and
Canada, you're not allowed to advertise
[SPEAKER_10]: for drugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the name Greenhouse was in the movies
and everybody said they're going to take
[SPEAKER_10]: away our license, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I was breaking my head how
I'm going to solve this problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: I came up with a new name.
[SPEAKER_10]: So where now I can basically promote us
and show the world around the equator what
[SPEAKER_10]: is going on, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's 200 million poor farmers
depending on marijuana around the equator,
[SPEAKER_10]: which many people don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, for example, Africa,
where I'm from and I go there,
[SPEAKER_10]: the kids cannot go to school because they
don't have money to buy fence for the
[SPEAKER_10]: cattle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they don't watch the cattle,
they eat the vegetable fuel and the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: fucking family dies.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's quite sad.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we try to show this kind of stuff,
how important that is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the same time, we we create
awareness for cannabis, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So after we did Columbia, Columbia
legalized, we did St. Vincent and the
[SPEAKER_10]: Grenadines, the prime minister went on
television and basically said,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to arrest people anymore
with a ounce of weed while American Canada
[SPEAKER_10]: are legal right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thailand, you know, now is legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: HICO has been working very hard since
2018, 22 they legalized.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congo, we changed the constitution in
Congo with our team and now medical
[SPEAKER_10]: marijuana is legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can obtain a license.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still very difficult, but we're
getting there.
[SPEAKER_10]: South Africa, Morocco, Swaziland,
Malawi, all these countries are legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, which is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd be working a lot in Argentina,
too, with the government there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And but yeah, our main priority,
of course, is with Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we just saw the movie in
Thailand is, of course, Thailand,
[SPEAKER_10]: because the government there was very,
very helpful and understands us,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and the business and wants to go
forward with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, so that's what we try to create
with Strain Hunters, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: the awareness and and making sure that
people understand what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do you feel about some of these
Canadian LPs and large corporations going
[SPEAKER_05]: to places like Save Vincent and the
Grenadines or to the cargo to produce
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass and other things to export it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, they're only losing money.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think this one is the company
making money.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we look at the figures, even of this
year, they're all losing between three
[SPEAKER_10]: hundred and nine hundred million dollars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know who's paying the bill.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_10]: We call it corruptism, you know,
and that, yeah, moms and pops are
[SPEAKER_10]: apparently keep pushing money into the
listed companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: The optimal way for these communities and
countries around the world that are
[SPEAKER_07]: looking to infuse money into their
countries, you know, for their people,
[SPEAKER_07]: what do you think the best model is?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think best model is you have if you have
a really good group of people or family
[SPEAKER_10]: that is really good growth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or find a financier or one person who
wants to join the team and not twenty and
[SPEAKER_10]: make a really good business plan that
stretches from five to ten years where you
[SPEAKER_10]: want to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: But certain milestones and work like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have a private private finance
instead of something out of the capital
[SPEAKER_10]: market where you get pushed in the wrong
direction and make your own decisions
[SPEAKER_10]: because you have no choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that is the only way for the
future.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see that in many industries.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see that in the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And most of those successful small
entrepreneurs have moved on like that,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, with one or two guys as a pick
up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think that's a much better
approach.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to grow it in our cases,
you know, I started growing in 83,
[SPEAKER_10]: opened my first club in 92.
[SPEAKER_10]: We never had nobody finding so we so we
financed everything out of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: So every time we had a little money,
we opened something again, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: same as we do in Thailand, we just grow
organically.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have no loans from banks or from
other people.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we just put our own money in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're not depending on any pressure,
you know, so things go wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know, there's bad months,
but it is not a bad time, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you think these countries around the
world in these places and people that want
[SPEAKER_07]: to get their piece of the cannabis pie
should be focusing on things like biomass
[SPEAKER_07]: or do you think they should be focusing on
things like the grants?
[SPEAKER_07]: They have an identity in places that
exporting stuff that has an identity more
[SPEAKER_07]: so than biomass.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look, if you look at the wine
industry, for example, in Australia,
[SPEAKER_10]: they have a big company called West Corp
and they have a lot of different ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is going to be space for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be huge companies that
sell, let's say, supermarket weed,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, you will have those guys and
then you will have the craft families,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, that sell a great product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those will be in the future the
strongest one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see that in the wine, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if it's good people,
you know, we know a few of them,
[SPEAKER_10]: they will survive.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you need a great brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to be a great grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you have to have everything in
place, but that's for everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to be an Indy car driver or you
want to go to the Olympics, you have to be
[SPEAKER_10]: great, too, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not so easy anymore because,
you know, there's a lot of people in this
[SPEAKER_10]: grower week here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in Oregon, there are more people.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are more vices than there are
people, you know, to say that something
[SPEAKER_10]: like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it's like crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like 103 or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: What can you expect, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it just takes the whole market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the one thing that I think a lot
of people avoid.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then you have to be a great brand and a
good grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: You come with something new, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I said, if you have your own
dispensary and you announce and you film,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, what we also always did,
we filmed all our stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are one of the few people that film
what we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And like now we're dropping Super Lemonade
times RS11.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're dropping Super Lemonade times GMO
and times Pink Candy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, every time we come with new
stuff, you know, new tastes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's good for any
respectable brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then you still have your staples,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're a Super Lemon Hayes.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's always your staple.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Super Lemon Hayes is probably the
plant used the most in the world for
[SPEAKER_10]: breeding and for everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of our flagship varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now you see the Lemon Orange and the
Fulgas coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also King's Juice, you know, for hash is
probably the number one extraction plant
[SPEAKER_10]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you find a good Fino, we flower it
off indoor in six weeks and two days,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is like really fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really fast.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and yeah, it's just that one
looks a little blue reddish.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just you know, we had that discussion
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody is trying to maintain
quality as they scale, what are some
[SPEAKER_05]: recommendations that you can make?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think where everybody goes wrong
post-Harvard, Harvest, Ryan, Keurin.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where everybody fails nearly.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you really need to nail that
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like everything under 14 days doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can dream doing seven days in nine
days, 11 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a good product, but you don't
have the best.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you need 14 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to play the last four days with
the humidity and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Mr. Wei, how are you going to box
it?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like, unfortunately,
I can't do it for GMP.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for the Thai market, I do everything
in cardboard boxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So not plastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody goes in plastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cardboard breeds and you know,
so I think that's why our weed is better
[SPEAKER_10]: than the rest.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we cure it a few weeks before we
take it out of the boxes and manicure and
[SPEAKER_10]: store it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And everything keeps under the same
temperature humidity.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the whole GMP line we have all the way
through the way through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, even the car that drives to Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because yeah, then you don't lose the
quality, you know, that's the only way.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it's quite complicated.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's easier if you have 10
lights and it gets more difficult when you
[SPEAKER_10]: have 50 and it gets nearly impossible when
you have 500 lights, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So and then again, it's a spreadsheet,
you know, it's like every room like should
[SPEAKER_10]: have a dry room behind, you know,
because you cannot hang stuff from other
[SPEAKER_10]: rooms three days later in the same room,
which everybody does.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we refuse, you know, like that's one
of the main things.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's post-harvest where 99% of this
stuff goes wrong with what grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not always the fault of the grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a lack of financial issues,
you know, like it's we can't build too
[SPEAKER_10]: many dry rooms because we already,
you know, spend too much money in the
[SPEAKER_10]: overhead there or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or no space.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or no space.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the other big problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you see vertical grow,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it came from a system in
California where you pay for square feet
[SPEAKER_10]: tax.
[SPEAKER_10]: And not if you go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it was adapted from the
lettuce industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: They took it from the lettuce industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these five stack.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but lettuce industry is not
flowered.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a flea here.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I think there's challenges and
I think for some people it works.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it works for the bulk industry that
you can never get a perfect product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what are your thoughts on under
canopy lights?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no experience with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was with some aliens last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two years ago, they were just trying it
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard good things about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's necessary,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, of course, it's one of the many
things we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think they're really great
customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We use Favon's.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a huge fan of Favon's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a lot of Bobby bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I heard 20, 25 percent more,
but then OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to need more air
conditioning, more dehum.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, you're going to put more heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, again, and depending on the
environment, if you have a greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_07]: has low PPFD in the winter and you can't
do winter runs, you can use just under
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend who's using just under
canopy lights in his greenhouse during the
[SPEAKER_07]: winter and now getting a yield,
he's able to do a seed drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's a time and a place for
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a time and a place for double
stacks.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, especially if you're a stream
model.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a time and place for all
those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not ideal.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you have cheap real estate,
why should you stack, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, you know, if you really look at
the situation, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_10]: we all become potato farmers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said that 20 years ago on all the things
that went on, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you just tell me which potato farmer
farms potatoes in the city.
[SPEAKER_10]: None.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why are we with our growers in the
city?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we've been pushed there by the
cops.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only reason we are there.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's silly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you want to grow marijuana in the
city?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no trees growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no tomatoes growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no grapes growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are we growing in the city?
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, so it's because of the cops.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but it started in the 70s with the
police.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think that's what got us.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I grew illegal in Amstheim in
the city because they couldn't find us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it doesn't make sense, no?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and so there's this this difference
in price between indoor and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think outdoor in some ways is a
superior product.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if you look on social media,
obviously the indoor products could be
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as effect, no, I mean,
I think I've refocused my my breeding onto
[SPEAKER_07]: effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where my friends passed away of 420 this
year and he was all about breeding for
[SPEAKER_07]: effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he gifted me his seed library about
70,000 seeds that he was breeding for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that got me thinking, like,
what are we doing this for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Social media has us trying to grow stuff
that looks a certain way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that, you know, there's
commercial viability, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, we're we smoke because we like
the way it makes us feel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We like the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I think we underestimate a lot
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we grow basically for turpents
for the taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's much more important,
like food in a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you see like the really good turpents
for clients, you know, like lemon orange
[SPEAKER_10]: and all those guys, they all go 24,
26, 27.
[SPEAKER_10]: We technically score lower than you guys
in America, but that's because your your
[SPEAKER_10]: testing in America is pure fraud.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to say it's
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything is pumped up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So where is where is your 32 is the same
as our 27, kind of.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's like five points
different, but it's the same.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a different method of testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the problem in the United States is
depending on what lab you go to,
[SPEAKER_07]: it could be there could be a 10 percent
difference in testing, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't ignore it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just all over the place because it's
incentivized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm not big on government oversight
in the cannabis industry, but I do think
[SPEAKER_07]: we need more oversight with testing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like that's well, biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is more, you know,
like I think weeds that's between 24 and
[SPEAKER_10]: 28 or let's say between 20 and 28 taste
27, maybe taste much better than weeds
[SPEAKER_10]: above there, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But also if you take sativas, you know,
like take my one snow super super silvers.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're 23, 24, we get much higher than
one from 30.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because the combination of
flavonoids and terpenes is much higher
[SPEAKER_10]: effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like a mental eye compared
to this body couch lock stone,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it doesn't always say that if you're
high in THC, then it's better.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like go to this all you can
eat restaurant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so how do you think that's going to
change for the future?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like the cannabinoids,
especially THC is how people buy weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is that how they buy weed in Thailand
as well or?
[SPEAKER_10]: Some.
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest example was Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when it started here,
everybody wanted 30 percent, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you see shifting also in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't see that anymore, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: 45 percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I think really technically,
I think there's some science behind it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Technically, you could go until 36.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that is the absolute max you could
have in a client, because, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: you also have sticks and leaves,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the daughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because there's no oversight,
there's incentives for these labs and also
[SPEAKER_07]: these companies to have higher test
results.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you do that, basically you're
incentivizing all these people to get
[SPEAKER_07]: higher lab results, which basically skews
up the whole system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there needs to be more
standardization here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just one of the flawed things in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, people should just make up
their mind what they like.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I think the people in our
industry are smart enough to see what
[SPEAKER_10]: their smoke, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, unfortunately, there's a lot of
people who go to the wrong places.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's just creating
awareness over time being people
[SPEAKER_10]: understand, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think a more educated market will
have a brand trust.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll trust different brands,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once you're more educated on stuff,
you're going to go for things to like
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically, I think, genetic names like
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_07]: People know what they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: So people will get more awareness.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also the people behind the brand
who market the brand, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: that people will go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in California, some of the celebrity
brands that came on really had really bad
[SPEAKER_07]: quality products.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were basically banking on the fact
that we had this celebrity behind them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is, is that that ended up
not being successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs five or six different brands that
came out with big celebrities where
[SPEAKER_07]: there's no call to fire, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're an educated market that as
soon as the market becomes more educated,
[SPEAKER_07]: they don't want better quality products.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might get it once, but you're not
going to get them for a second sale.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we had the experience in Canada,
you know, where we were going to make
[SPEAKER_10]: Stoop Dogg and Drake and then much more.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they turned on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And later I was making it to KG.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was in our shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yesterday, they announced it was 700
million.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I told him the approach was not good.
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, we'll figure it out together.
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, you know, like a little tip.
[SPEAKER_10]: It lost 700 million.
[SPEAKER_10]: How the hell do you lose 700 million in
one year?
[SPEAKER_15]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: In American Canada, you guys lose billions
in one year.
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll plug into the camera.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'll tell you, it's not a sale.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's money from the stock market.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they all blow it up on salaries and
crazy stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, lawyers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lawyers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I see kids that are 24,
25 getting their Master Grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: They call them near in America.
[SPEAKER_10]: We ever signed on the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't work with Master Growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I mean, that's the biggest way.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're 25.
[SPEAKER_10]: They get $200,000.
[SPEAKER_10]: How the hell is that possible?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course, you're going to go broke.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there is time based on
everything, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, there are people that will probably
let it back down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but not if you're 24, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Four years experience or five years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, or one and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the resume says 20 years experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the term Master Grower to me is
a big red flag.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when people call themselves Master
Grower, I see a resume with Master Grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big red flag, typically.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's many good growers, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have Thai growers and then you
guys?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's basically me and Dust.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then now we have two Canadians,
one half Dutch, half Canadian,
[SPEAKER_10]: and another Canadian guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since only three months.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's because of the GMP.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't do that because I'm too busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is really a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the amount of pay to work is one
meter forty, which is six feet of SOPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hate reading.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we took two experienced guys to help us
out there, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going to do that part.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do the growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, if it's pharma,
it has to have an amazing amount of
[SPEAKER_10]: traceability and a million SOPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's actually the only two.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the first two years, me and Dust,
we want to have an advantage above the
[SPEAKER_10]: rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: So nobody really knew we were there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we went straight from the Bangkok
airport to the other little airport and to
[SPEAKER_10]: the North, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at one point, everybody would start
recognizing us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we opened May last year.
[SPEAKER_10]: We opened the first shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then we came out in the open and we
were there, you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as Thailand, how do pre-rolls
and carts do?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts on pre-rolls and
carts for the future?
[SPEAKER_07]: We sell pre-rolls now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know what the future is going to
bring because we have twenty seven
[SPEAKER_10]: license.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have we are there's only two people
with extraction license.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really sure what is going.
[SPEAKER_10]: But because we are GMP, we're going to
export.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in our portfolio now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we only make dry, safe,
bubble hash, rosin and pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_10]: But where that is going in the future,
I'm not really sure yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going in the direction of
hand rolls and pre-rolls and extracted
[SPEAKER_07]: carts just because of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean in general?
[SPEAKER_15]: In general.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's great.
[SPEAKER_15]: General, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look, you know, there's always a
person who comes up by the flower and is
[SPEAKER_10]: in a rush and wants to smoke a joint in a
car, takes a joint with her.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there is the people who I can
never figure it out because even my kids,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, they say I make the worst
joints.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I make more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: More people agree on that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But listen, I work 18 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have time to make a joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I roll really quickly and I put it in
my paper and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you have the guy who's going to
take all the little branches out and the
[SPEAKER_10]: leaves and he takes 25 minutes before he's
done.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he also takes the rosin and make
the little snake in there and that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as the guy's got hours free every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't have that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, for everything,
there is something.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the hash will be more and
more.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you see our bubble hash is really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rosin, of course, will never go away
anymore because it tastes amazing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, like rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that will stay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you have the cheaper versions like the
Dry Zift, Pollinator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: These static extractors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just the whole statics thing now,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're going to Morocco with static
machines.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, yeah, this for everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a market, you know, especially for
the nice brands that, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: like you can be a little bit different
because the bulk guys are not going to go
[SPEAKER_10]: into this way to complicated for them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, there you can make a difference
with your with your varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think people were going to the I
feel like we're going in this direction of
[SPEAKER_07]: convenience.
[SPEAKER_07]: People want everything handed to the,
you know, they live in a world of
[SPEAKER_07]: convenience.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in my opinion, the hand rolls that I
like the hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think quality is going to dictate a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, that's a little bit the problem with
the hand rolls.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you saw how we did in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: We work with these cans, you know,
these tuna cans that are sealed without
[SPEAKER_10]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, we don't put nitrogen because
the climate is quite complicated with the
[SPEAKER_10]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to try to keep that good.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you see that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the same problem in Amsterdam,
you know, joints.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to cross them and you can only
keep them certain amounts.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we try to we make them like every week
fresh, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is a it's a problem product.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's call it that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like you have a kilo in a bag and
you can open it to two months later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this joint at one point has to be
spoke, you know, because there is dries
[SPEAKER_10]: out, you know, especially like here,
like in Las Vegas and Colorado,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, all my friends that have grossed
it like it's painting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you know, as far as I guess we
touched on strain hunters.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about powder feeding?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we didn't really touch on powder
feeding because you're also a nutrient
[SPEAKER_07]: company owner.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys shoot internationally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we ship internationally worldwide.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're like, for example, in South America,
we control like 60 percent of the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's organically is the number one
product in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's a one component.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if your water is not so good,
you have to add calcium and you can add a
[SPEAKER_10]: booster.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a one component which everybody
10 years of said is not not possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: But slowly you see all people using,
especially people in the house,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, and so many other brands are
copying your model.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now everybody is getting the powder.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, technically, if you think about
all the liquid guys, it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_10]: sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you're bringing water to the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for it, you know, it's just yeah,
it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for us, you know, especially in
countries where it's more complicated,
[SPEAKER_10]: like one kilo of this powder is a thousand
liters nearly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you put it through your soil and and
it's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then every three weeks you add a
little.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's it's super easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you see nearly every hobby grower in
Germany and Switzerland and Spain using
[SPEAKER_10]: it, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big, big, big grow operations don't use it
because they're all liquids.
[SPEAKER_10]: They make them own or they buy them from
some certain companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I like to propagate,
you know, sustainability.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why we sell the organic product
and we sell it also mineral form for the
[SPEAKER_10]: guys who want to do rock or cocoa or
whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think price wise and easy wise,
not 17 bottles, you know, and if you try
[SPEAKER_10]: our organic stuff, there's nothing better
to taste better.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have one piece of advice to
something, someone coming into the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry or into the space, what would
that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's very difficult now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to lie about that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Find a good group that you can work with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if your dream is to start for yourself
one day, the only thing I can tell you is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be really hard work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to work like 15 to 18 hours a
day, create your own brand, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: grow organically, don't invest too much
money people and always, always make sure
[SPEAKER_10]: you keep the majority in your own company.
[SPEAKER_10]: So nobody can run away with whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're most welcome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a podcast next week.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll probably air in three or four weeks
after that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have a featured fight for the
night.
And in first place,
[SPEAKER_12]: with jar number five, fall family farms,
the Oakland oranges, ball family.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_12]: Round of applause for both family farmers,
