[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little bit
afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm afraid too because I got the
like at least a gram of pietello skittles.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
lab podcast and today our special guest is
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco from CGO, connoisseur grade only,
the man, the myth, the guy who rolls some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best joints I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Marco?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, honestly, I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done a bunch of podcasts out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you roll great joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were hanging out in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, uh, you were with Bruno rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a great time, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Serving you guys up with some amazing
roles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vibes were awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was quite an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we did the food out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, Sergio put that thing together and
it was wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, the food was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got down, you was there from
sunup to sundown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we did shopping one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did prep in the night and then rocked
it out the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love those collaborative events
where it's like 15 people come together to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like literally it just was the tie-in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the good flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my buddy who was a chef at the wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ricky helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all these people contributing to
make something so much bigger than
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's what I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, definitely bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a real synergy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had it all going together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, uh, I enjoyed every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was a very, uh, I got invited
and it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to jump into it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got hash whole Island coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about this for a minute
and I'm super excited about hash whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some real fun for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some performers coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got great food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some rides, some games,
you know, uh, we got this, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: trackless train coming out for everybody
to enjoy, be able to, cause some people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like to walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're going to, there's a
little perk so people can just get on it
[SPEAKER_03]: and just ride around the little Island for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I feel like it's the right time
of year to do an event out in Rio Vista.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rio Vista is a special place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to go out and get crawdads out in
Rio Vista.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so definitely I've been fishing out in
the Delta, uh, water skiing, wakeboarding
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Delta special, I go out there
maybe once a year and to be able to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: for hash whole Island is going to be
exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got people coming out with their boats,
you know, their jet skis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, there's a dock right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have boat slips too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people can bring out whatever
water activities they want to come bring
[SPEAKER_03]: out, maybe do a boat tie off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be lots of hash
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash holes are popping these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are doing hash holes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a competition as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a competition for all of the,
all the attendees, the sponsors and brands
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, if you want to be a part of it,
you know, make sure you check out our
[SPEAKER_03]: page, you know, check out hash whole
island.com and, uh, check us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of good
information there to find out for the
[SPEAKER_03]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be there with the
cannabis brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a 10 by 20, and we're going to be
doing live podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be smoking everybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be hanging out,
having a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be an adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have people coming from all over the
nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got people come from different parts of
the world, you know, and I'm really
[SPEAKER_03]: excited to, for everybody to get to meet
new people, you know, that's really what
[SPEAKER_03]: we do this for us, for everybody to get to
know someone new and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: build their network and build their net
worth, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the, is this second or third
year?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our third annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time's flying, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, May 17th makes you tune in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into your history with
joints and history with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start out with when you started
smoking, how you started smoking,
[SPEAKER_00]: what area are you from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Sacramento, California,
first and foremost, you know, the city of
[SPEAKER_03]: trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to say, yeah, I started
smoking around, I think I was a teenager
[SPEAKER_03]: around 13 ish, 14 years old, you know,
and first time I smoked, it was in a tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hiding from my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the days though, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to smoke in trees behind the
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We climbed up in the trees and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky we didn't break our necks and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think I was smoking out of a
can too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping little holes in the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bend it and you pop the little holes
and you hit it with the lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little aluminum never hurt us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little aluminum never hurt us,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bammer weed and aluminum, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had good bud too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked in cans, but it was like the
thing where you didn't have to carry
[SPEAKER_00]: around a pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get in trouble for carrying a pipe
when we were younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially being under the age of 18
or 21, I guess it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, man, I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, but good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has been a great place for
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're somewhat the epicenter
of cannabis legalization, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Oakland and then all the way out in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many big brands out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, definitely all over, you know,
Northern California and SoCal,
[SPEAKER_03]: or like a Mecca, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a Mecca, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's amazing Sacramento is just
popping up with great brands and great
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, great rollers, great
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like they've got a good
food scene out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want good sushi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some amazing sushi out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like literally when it comes to
cannabis, Sacramento has its own thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: own identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people don't
understand, you know, Sacramento is the
[SPEAKER_03]: city of trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they changed the narrative
because they didn't want that stigma on
[SPEAKER_03]: Sacramento as being the capital of
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had to change it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But definitely, you know, come out,
come visit us, come check out the fire we
[SPEAKER_03]: create.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool, you know, we encourage
people to come visit our city.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not LA, but it's
definitely, you know, it's its own special
[SPEAKER_03]: little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the scene there is extra special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, the Connect community,
they do events out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Sergio, again, he does amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's breeders out there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys literally have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want extract, you want breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have amazing extract artists out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the biggest brands are out
there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all the big dogs out there
crushing it, man, on a daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are straight inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's tough these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think there's the one side
of the industry where everyone's like got
[SPEAKER_00]: jaded and they're upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there's still a lot of us
that are excited about the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still excited every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love coming to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, of course, there's times
where it's like, man, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also on the genetic side,
not on the cultivative side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a cultivator isn't easy these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you're going to do it,
you better be the best.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's batch to batch nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that wrong batch, you know,
might give you a bad representation of
[SPEAKER_03]: what your product may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just might have been a bad week,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only as good as like when I was a
chef, it was you're only as good as your
[SPEAKER_00]: last meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're only as good as your last
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a batch of crap out,
you put a batch of hand rolls that are
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, hash holes, something bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like it can ruin your
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can ruin your brand and knock you down
a few steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why it's so important to be
humble, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also quality assurance is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have that quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like these things
aren't easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you want to perform at
the highest level, especially with hand
[SPEAKER_00]: rolls, which I've known, like we've been
going through it because I work with SF
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana and I work with several other brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, how do we do it to where
it's cost effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these days you can't charge what
you used to, but also to get a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your quality is very, very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just teach somebody how to roll
a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be passionate about joint
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it has to be passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be the passion, the love for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't smoke, you have to have
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to smoke around you because
it's like there's no way for you to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if it burns correctly unless you're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, because you won't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I was saying earlier,
it's all about pressure points.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're rolling,
you know, too much pressure causes it to
climb.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, therefore then making it combust
at a hotter temperature, then then
[SPEAKER_03]: therefore burning up your turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you go to hit it again,
it's going to taste like nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, compared to when you roll it
more looser, a little bit, a little loose,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a little tight, you know, not too
loose to where you're you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to just, you know, like it's all
airy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not the way you want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can go into more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there's so many little details
and I'd love to share with the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: watch my podcast because we haven't had
someone in a long, we had Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: professional joint roller come on the show
before and he has his own perspective and
[SPEAKER_00]: outlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he does really good work as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the guy right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really, I mean, he basically goes
and QCs everyone else's work, which I love
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody, you know, somebody's got to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when he was doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, you know, I'm not the guy
to put people on blast, but if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that and you want to show people what's
actually out there, what's out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: rec, I mean, we were just looking at some
products that are from September and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's really tough when you're trying
to get your product out there to a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer and you want them to smoke it
immediately and they don't smoke it for
[SPEAKER_00]: four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like in the jar,
you know, or in the, in the joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like a big gap between like
the quality and the, how long it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it lasts the longevity of the
freshness because, you know, some,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on how it's grown with salts or
if it's organic, you know, I feel as if
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes organic, like the, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Synganics or with like salts and
organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Synganics personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I feel like that stuff lasts a
little bit longer than, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: salts, you know, and sometimes organic,
you know, doesn't really last long,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: MI's it does sometimes because I had a
batch from October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on the last like 10 cases,
but there from October, but they still
[SPEAKER_03]: taste like they did when we rolled them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so crazy, you know,
based on how you roll them, that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: long, you know, you'll see with the shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you roll them, how you store them,
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with rolling joints, I've been rolling
joints since the nineties, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like my joints have definitely
gotten better, especially over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really stepped my game up since last
year, you know, and I go down these deep
[SPEAKER_00]: dives where I'm like, okay, which tip is
the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: What gauge tip is the best?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what paper is the best and let's
try them all in smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoy that part of it too,
because I enjoy smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy the R and D side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then getting into hash rolls
now it's like, okay, what kind of hash
[SPEAKER_00]: works the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, you know, like there's so many
different types of hash, even within
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, there's several types of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several grades you can work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will food grade work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will, you know, fresh, fresh flower
pressed rosin work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different options with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of variables with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, you have some fresh press
that's going to be, you know, less,
[SPEAKER_03]: less stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have some that's really
stable that stays cold care for like two
[SPEAKER_03]: months, literally, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have some that literally
turns over in two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just varies on the stability
of the actual compound of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: either being fresh press or cold care or,
or pietella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or pietella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the pietella and you basically
pietella yields a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the second you squish it with
rosin, you get, you know, you get an 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're losing 20%, but also the
pietella is meant to be aged for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just now getting into it,
you know, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Frenchie's the motivation for all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I'm doing Frenchie justice
and he would be smiling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, I know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some fire rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, so this stuff's exciting
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like the nuances with joint
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like most people are like,
oh, it's just a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's not just a joint because
there's every, every last little detail
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be considered, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whether it's the paper, the tip,
the gauge of the tip, the crutch that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even when you're smoking it,
there's ways you can smoke it where if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't smoke it correctly, you're going to
ruin the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there definitely is different
ways to, you know, consume the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially like when you're smoking your,
say you're smoking something like this
[SPEAKER_03]: right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is two grams with a half gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we put?
[SPEAKER_03]: Squirt with some SV26 from Dream,
all living soil right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, you know, like some people are
very big on white ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people don't really understand the
difference between white ash and black
[SPEAKER_03]: ash, gray ash, you know, like living soil
usually doesn't really give you something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like a super bone white ash,
you know, based on the compounds and how
[SPEAKER_03]: it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you're able to flush stuff out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, I think there's,
there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my opinion is, is, does it taste
amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make you feel good?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the two most important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: White ash is something that we've all been
talking about for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so funny that a lot of guys,
it's their first thing on their check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn white?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it drip?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the drip is very subjective to
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there that oil ring?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do love a good oil ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy looking at a good oil ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, someone told me that with
white ash, it almost always is smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with like the grayer ashes or the salt
and pepper, it's like that could be hit or
[SPEAKER_00]: miss, you know, but with white ash,
it always is smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know whether I agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put a lot of calcium in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's subjective for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the guys say, because, you know,
like this is burning pretty decent,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but it does, has a, it has a
small throat bite, like small one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's smooth, but it does have a little
bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked one and it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, well I had a bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even get mad at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and sometimes the flavor is so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't get mad at it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it hurts so good, you know,
because it's like, it's good, but it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you feel that you're like, you know,
in the back of your throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it has a little bit of burn,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, straight Skittles, it should be smooth
all the way down to the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be tasting that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like Skittles with Skittles
Rosin too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Z on Z goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and the beauty thing is, is now we're
getting in also these flavor combinations
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many cool combos to come up
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unlimited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can blend Rosin on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have the Rosin blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could even do the flour blend and
combine those where you got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five or six things blended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it becomes almost like,
uh, how wine is created in these different
[SPEAKER_00]: blends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as time goes by, you know,
they do roles cure up, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes they cure up for the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they care for the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, and like you're saying like,
you're doing combos, doing flour blended
[SPEAKER_03]: with hash, then rolled with Rosin,
you know, them are great, great ideas for
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're coming up and you want to
be different in the industry, there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: tip right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many little things that you can
do to make yourself a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just like these rollers,
every single roller I know has their own
[SPEAKER_00]: way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I love that, especially at
the top level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys at the top level, I feel like you
guys all have your own specific way of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no right or wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all beautiful joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smoke properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to all the big dogs out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got Bruno Rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Stuart Doinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, uh, Sav.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Strain Chasers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Roll BMC.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many amazing top dog rollers
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's really cool to see cause
everybody has their own techniques,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and styles and it's really cool
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you guys are just upping
the game for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's, it's great being part
of this community, especially at this high
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then the access to good flour and
rosin, that's just next level too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're coming up with so many
cool ideas, you know, with different
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborations for the rec market right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool to see, you know,
what we're able to come up for the,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the people of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a great rec market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's people that might want
to hate on it or whatever, but our rec
[SPEAKER_00]: market is pretty good and it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: One day at a time, we're making it better,
you know, brands like myself and James
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, what he does, he's,
you know, obviously searching through all
[SPEAKER_03]: these genetics, you know, popping beans
every day, night, day, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's creating a new way for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so we have new strains of flour
and new strains of rosin to pair with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it's really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about pushing the plant forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, you know, I'm trying to
do my job and also just stay in my lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: What for, as far as for breeding,
like I need to take a deep dive down
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go study rosin and how it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be an expert on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with joint rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can roll good joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like I can roll joints
that you can sell because I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to understand the smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, because when we do phenome hunting,
I give out joints to people and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me what you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give nugs out really anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a little bit, but for the most part,
they're not going to understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to roll it the way they
need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one person to the next is going to
have a different experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he smokes it in a pipe or he smokes it
in a bong or he smokes it in a vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's not going to have the same experience
as the guy who rolls a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we can try to put people on the
same level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going through so many different
phenotypes constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that one area where it's like,
it has to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to tell me your personal
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't, we can't look at a piece of
paper and it's going to say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one burns this way or this one tastes
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it has these terpene profiles,
there's so many nuances within the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and flavor combinations of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just terpenes because there's
flavorants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these other components,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically sulfur-based compounds that
make stuff gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that, but you don't measure those
with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot for people to understand when
it comes to, we're not just smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really something that we're,
it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that we're learning to
evolve into too as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to take it seriously and as
scientific as possible, but yet still
[SPEAKER_00]: considering all the nuances and all the
details in a way that other people can
[SPEAKER_00]: digest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we burn one in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We better burn one in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's get this light one up real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can start talking about ash
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like another, another good thing,
like I want to show you guys the proper
[SPEAKER_03]: ways to light a joint, you know,
would be obviously there's a crown,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, using your torch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Torch is always the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Using a torch is optimal, but if you're
not using a torch, use a big, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recommend it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just based on the Flint crop causes a soot
when you go to light it, there's that
[SPEAKER_03]: black little ash that goes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to get a nice cherry going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that nice even burn on the top
and it's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Dutch crown is really
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what differentiates the
good and the great rollers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, not always, but I feel
like the guys who do the Dutch crowns
[SPEAKER_00]: really good do really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a whole art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically with our, with our hand rolls
and our hash holes, we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have a QR code, but also it's
going to say directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's literally an eight and a
half by 11 piece of paper with
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to keep it light and funny,
but also the same time it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate people on how to smoke it because
you can't smoke it like a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a cigar, but also you have
to hold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a certain way you should
hold them, you know, and then same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are like, Oh, I want to
ash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't, don't ask my joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the one thing you don't want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the one thing is a very
counterintuitive because you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to ash it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many times that, you know,
I was out there and when I was in LA,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot, a lot of people aren't really too
educated, but there are a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just funny when I was out there
chilling, I noticed that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: were just smoking casually, literally
hitting it back to back, back to back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait, but I didn't want to say
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I just wanted to continue to see how
other people smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, Oh my gosh,
education is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to take a second to educate
people, but we're at a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the time or place to interrupt
everybody and say, don't ash it,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the cherry to get too hot
because that'll destroy the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty with ash too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a nice ash on there,
it's going to keep that cherry nice and
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Insulation, it's going to keep that cherry
nice and cool.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to replace the heat like none
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool though, you know,
when you pay attention to like how a joint
[SPEAKER_03]: is performing, you know, like how long it
takes for it to spark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it instant combustion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it combusting correctly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, when you're smoking it,
you know, sometimes people will slide a
[SPEAKER_03]: joint and they'll forget it and it goes
right out compared to like, if the flower
[SPEAKER_03]: has grown correctly, it's, you know,
been fed, has been taken care of,
[SPEAKER_03]: loved, you know, that joint will stay lit
for 10 minutes, five minutes, six,
[SPEAKER_03]: seven minutes, you know, it'll stay lit
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it looks like it's gone out,
a lot of times it's still, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where you put the rosin in the
joint is so important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put it back a little ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guys bring it all the way to the tip
and I don't think that's the right way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, me, I like to put it in the
middle-ish kind of like at least one third
[SPEAKER_03]: from the front.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why is I like to be able to
let the flower combust, get it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you get to, you want to try the
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you pairing it with?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put the hash in the front,
you're not really going to get that chance
[SPEAKER_03]: to experience the flavor, you know,
on your palate with the actual,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the flower, the terpenes from the
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mandala squirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit of that starburst
taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny because we put, we paired it
with some starburst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the perfect pairing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a squirt with a starburst number 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Fino that Dream by ESG on
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of their Finos right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we're doing a food show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you back on the food show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the food show is going to be Omakase
style where we pair different food with
[SPEAKER_00]: either joints, dabs, you know,
we'll use different devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some really good alcohol out
there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, a shot sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, and you don't even need a full
shot, you just need a little sip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have the kitchen set up
here so we can do the food show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be great because we can
incorporate my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's in the form of rosin,
pietella, joints, bong rips, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smoke at any vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a vaporizer company to come on the
show, show us their vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we try different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of cool vaporizer companies
out there too as well nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores and Bickel too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a really great, you know,
they're the volcano manufacturer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they just do a really good
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many different companies
with devices that are good now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm a huge fan of Focus V.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this stuff they're doing,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, shout out to the homies over there at
Focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're crushing it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty nice, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is one of the roles that we
entered into the proper joint competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10K.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the 10K winner though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're smoking it now though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a little baby bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a nice bite though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like it's like, that's how it
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how, you know, you're smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's got that, it's full flavor too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's not like very, some of
these ones are very linear where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's one thing and it's like either
super candy or super papaya, or even with
[SPEAKER_00]: that GMO, like you get the gacks and the
GMOs together where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are special too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love the complexity where it's like
multi-layered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you burn it down, like the
flavor gets intensified and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, wait, there's turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even taste it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's one thing too,
you know, there's a couple of things about
[SPEAKER_03]: our palate, you know, when we smoke,
you know, from the left to the right,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the middle, you know, you're going to,
you're going to, your palate is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: interact different with each hit just
based on this different taste buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with your palate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So always remember that when you're
smoking, try it out, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it's fact, it's bro
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hit it from your left, hit it from your
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once in the middle, and then you'll be
able to, you'll, you'll taste three
[SPEAKER_03]: different, you'll, it's, it's crazy,
you know, but try it out out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this thing is burning really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's exactly what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's, it's performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's really smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as far as tips, what are your
preferences on tips?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it just varies depending on
the size of the role that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: create.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm rolling like a, say I'm rolling one
grammers, I roll for the rec mark,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a one gram with the point two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do those with the 10 mil.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, I'd get a nine mil,
honestly, just because the smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: diameter restricts airflow, therefore
causing it to burn at a slower rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens when it burns at a slower
rate, you get a better accuracy of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I feel like, you know,
because like with that one, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a bigger tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a 12 mil, you know, and like,
it's, it's like, when you hit it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a cannon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hits you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Whoa, it's, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to like, when you're smoking a
smaller diameter tip, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a more slower hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still on the fence of whether I like
the 10 to the 12, but I guess it's
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the amount of flour you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a lot of flour,
you got to use a 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely anything over like 2.5,
two grams, two grams and up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a 12 mil is, is good depending
on how the flour is though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's some flour that's fluffy and
there's some flour that's really dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and a two gram will look like a
1.5 to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so sometimes it just varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Z we got is pretty fluffy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you, you put a two grams Z next to
a two gram of GDP or something really
[SPEAKER_00]: dense, you know, speaking of which we got
the ZDP coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to do a collab on that
a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's everything you would,
you know, like if you, if you hear the
[SPEAKER_00]: ZDP, you're like, Oh man, when I think of
ZDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leans heavy on the granddaddy with a
hint of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm over comp like thinking,
do we put more Skittles, rosin or do we
[SPEAKER_03]: put like a grape gas, uva, rosin,
you know, something that has that grape
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor or them Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Skittles makes everything taste
better pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always like, I, I always go to
Skittles right away, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I should be doing is going towards
different things that compliment it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Skittles pretty much across the
board, you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be super sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rosin is smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not overly strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, that Crippie rosin is fucking
amazing, but it is so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even in the pen, the vape pen,
like you can smoke Skittles five hits,
[SPEAKER_00]: one hit of the Crippie is equal to five
hits of the Skittles.
Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was just thinking like,
say with the flower of like, say the ZDP
[SPEAKER_03]: said it's a heavy GDP, meaning it's more
grapey, more floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not lavender, floral, old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, when you squeeze it,
you're like, it smells just like
[SPEAKER_00]: granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that nostalgia coming back right
when you squeeze the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a not so great structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when you're talking, like when you
said flora, so first thing that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: going to say, what I like to pair certain
flowers with is a floral of a rosin,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cause some people don't really
care for floral, but if you know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: use it, it's really good, you know,
just based on what you're pairing with.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love floral turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that floral expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a, like that silky floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like rose water and you know,
just something like just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a creme rose Skittles, Tim and Kyle
from Canon organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from their seeds and we were
growing it and we had all of us lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dude, that creme rose was like
straight rose water and they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles and it was just everything that
you could imagine about like candy and
[SPEAKER_00]: rose water, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been like searching for that ever
since I talk about my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some people send me seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even popped the seeds and just not
found exactly what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's something special about
those unique, those outliers, those
[SPEAKER_00]: unicorns, you know, they're out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, definitely they're out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like white thorn rose has a
crazy floral, but it's funky and it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got like this, I don't want to call
it zest, but it's like, it's got this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that, that, that I don't know
how to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just, it's got that little
something in there, you know, and like
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what we're looking for,
for the next strain, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously that's the next level we want to
come with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love white thorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love white thorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white thorn rosin is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it even makes the, the best rosin
gummies I've ever had were made with white
[SPEAKER_00]: thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect from it is so good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about the strain on my show a lot,
but it's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The family, they're going to, they're
doing a whole lineup with, with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: White thorn rose crosses with over there
at the Casa Flor family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some special stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually giving Johnny my ZDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the only cultivator outside of my
circle that's getting the ZDP and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to breed it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it has a similar effect where
it has that feel good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just something special
about stuff like that, especially like on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floral side, it's just as exciting as
the gassy and also the purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, but it's, there's so
much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's really gone that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much candy gas out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cherry gas, candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all, it's all that candy with gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like those are really strong too,
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like really strong and sedative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked a joint yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the perm RS 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny that RS 11, I was talking to
Dave cause he's done breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some, I have my permanent
midnight, which is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this, all the phenos really have
the permanent nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has that, I think it's candy paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a couple and then some of them
really lean towards that fucking a marker.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love good marker crosses,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see all the new marker
crosses coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: First class genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do some good marker crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I got my cut of permanent
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: From yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: First class genetics that he's the secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows about the guy who gets the
genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good friend too.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the highest level, the guy's kind of,
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like even the breeders,
it's like, I like collaborating with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sharing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sharing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think genetics, I want,
I don't want to share every last little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit because a lot of times we go through a
lot of costs to phenohunt stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put everyone on game with my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone who wants to learn how to breed
everything I do is like literally in my
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I don't, I don't hold back
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know how I do reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff is in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think education is key, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sharing education with everybody,
especially the guys when I buy my book,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people are home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like anybody can breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can do selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they can't do it on the scale of
other people, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the future is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's what makes you
separate, separate from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what makes your brand stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll stand out a lot more if you have
something unique and special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're not lying, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the, that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, creating your own genetics,
you know, coming with your own lineups,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, being different, not just going
and buying a, going to a dish,
[SPEAKER_03]: your own buying 10 different candies and
calling it 10 different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Runs and LCGs all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is runs back across the LCG with
a little bit of candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's cayenne rinse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the new runs, the line you
got dropping, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that one, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got chocolate runs and that that's a
chocolate times runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we, it's amazing though,
but it's got like the phenol we selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that's hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a run structure, but it has a
hazy nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number two is like just in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's runcy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have one that leans towards
that runcy LCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could cherry, like the, the candy gas
nose, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the old school runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it reminds me of the original runs
that we smoked back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What got that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what hyped up candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like gushers kind of like the
Smarties candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Al's was doing the gushers like back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was maybe six years ago or seven
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved me a good batch of the connected
gushers though, when it was over there on
[SPEAKER_03]: Faridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gushers is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy gushers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a few minutes and it's still
lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can sit here and talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the way we consume
joints now is so different from maybe 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, where, where we do roll them
in a way where I used to roll big joints
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but it's like these ones,
we can actually just let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk for five, five minutes,
seven minutes before we puff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to smoke these too fast
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second you start putting rosin and
stuff, it's like taking dabs and smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: joints at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like sedative is like, you're like,
yeah, cause I do dabs and they wake me up
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a dab in the morning and I'm
awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make me tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I'll smoke a whole joint in the
morning, but I don't smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hash will put me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally I have to, I can't smoke donuts
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I can't unless I'm in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless I'm on vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm smoking donuts from sunup to sundown.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm, I have to work and I have
business to do, I have to just smoke a
[SPEAKER_03]: flower roll or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I get so many effects from so
many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think hazes are making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love me a good haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's already out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite haze right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Fino hunting some blueberry haze
times King Louis the 13th from Dave
[SPEAKER_00]: Messford that passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some of that going on and I'm super
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I like Apollo haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I'm Fino hunting Apollo haze too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some old brother Grimm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I like super silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wrong with some super silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever had the Nana's haze over
there at Codra Verde?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh bro, it's Sunset Sherbert with their,
with the super silver haze, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bro, it's fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't quote me on super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's a haze though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sherbert haze cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a sherbert haze cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bro, I promise you, it's really,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do like that super silver
amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's super nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of Europe from fucking 15
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's like, I like diversity
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like sativas, like these narrow leaf
varieties, like African ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's funny cause you can
have these three African strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: people think of Durban, Malawi,
and then red Congo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, they're all from Africa,
but they all have very different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the Durban just kind of kicks
your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it'll put you in the dirt real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super, super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go over to the Malawi and the
Malawi is fricking amazing too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's almost psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit sounds like it would give me
fricking anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi is anxiety weed, but it's so super
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like psychedelic strong weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely THCV in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got the red Congo and the red
Congo gets you so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like a kid again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red Congo gets me high, but it makes
me giggly laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the other ones are more on like
the parent paranoia or like just out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that red Congo special.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're saying that,
it kind of, it sparked my interest in what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to direct, like push my
direction of like the brand is being able
[SPEAKER_03]: to like focus on like healing elements and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, like with certain weed,
it makes you giggly and laugh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cause some people are battling
depression and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we were able to find strains like
that, that's going to make them happy and
[SPEAKER_03]: give them uplifting, you know,
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the type of stuff that we want
to be able to be like descriptive about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when we package our stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then people, when they're out there
shopping, because it's not just something
[SPEAKER_03]: we do as to have fun with, this is
medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, we're medicating,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's like, that's one thing that
I like, I'm working on right now for us as
[SPEAKER_03]: like, cause like you said, what you do,
you know, with the genetics, we're
[SPEAKER_03]: creating the new wave, creating more,
you know, and being able to say cross,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that strain with a strain that's
going to make a person hungry,
[SPEAKER_03]: give them, give them like, Oh,
I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people with cancer that are on
chemotherapy treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, literally they need
something that can help their nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: make them eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but other people are also,
you know, they're very thin and they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to put on weight and they don't need to
smoke some, some hazes to, they won't get
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to smoke something that's going
to make them hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally because there's some,
some weed don't make me hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll be hungry as a mug and then I,
and then I'll smoke and then I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: hungry no more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and I'm like, damn, I should have,
I should have ate before I smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but that goes for it, you know,
cause sometimes it literally kills that
[SPEAKER_03]: hunger.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GDP stuff like that made me super
hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the munchies from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's munchy weed, and then there's
stuff that's not munchy weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then also the way I consume it,
like depending on how high I get with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things, it's like, if I smoke
first thing in the morning, then I'm off.
[SPEAKER_00]: More hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I do a dab, it doesn't usually
make me hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, and I, I like Skittles dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, I've been smoking on the pen
with that deep dive into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been like trying different pens and
cartridges with my buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like literally there's,
you can have one cartridge to the next and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a different experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a different pull, different
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could taste different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like all these things,
if you're a breeder and you want to be not
[SPEAKER_00]: fully vertically integrated, but like if
you want to have stuff in your bin where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with product skews,
I'm a genetics guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know what the experience is
in these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually we're going to breed
specifically for carts as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, we'll do rosin carts,
but how is it experiencing in a pen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I get excited about those
deep dives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, well, I got to try all
these pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to try these different strains with
the same pen to see which one tastes the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause not every pen is going to give that
same reflection of the turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've really, I like the O2 vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The O2 vape is actually, cannabis brothers
use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the little square ones?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're the round thin ones with the
glass top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're maybe not the sexiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of these others, you get more
hardware.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the way they hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the temperature of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we tested a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the old school brands are
really good still too, but I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want cotton in your cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of them have the ceramic and
then sometimes under the ceramic,
[SPEAKER_00]: they put cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be careful because that will
give you cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like we're smoking to prevent lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of us smoke and they're
like, well, we're not going to get lung
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer from smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like one of the pluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're smoking cotton or smoking a
shitty cartridge from China, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: made properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a bootleg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a bootleg that has fucking problems
with it where it's got pesticides or who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to really be careful on what
you're putting in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, I try to eat mostly
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat all organic, but I try to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't necessarily smoke all
organic weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's synthetic mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have one, a hundred percent
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like certain things for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool is amazing for certain
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil is amazing for other
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa is great all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: All strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely different homes for different
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like lights too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS lights are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who says HPS lights aren't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're not as cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cost more to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as what you get out of it,
you get a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, this thing's still burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still tasting great.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing her thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's not like this next joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we smoke this next joint,
we're not going to be able to drive for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one's going to be creepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That creepy was very hard to roll up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, Jesus Christ, this thing is
sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm afraid too, because that's got
the like at least a gram of pietella of
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like the Skittles might help it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a diva right there, you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I was in Spain, I was hanging
out with Eric from Flow Gardens and he had
[SPEAKER_00]: some hemp for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high CBD, very low THC, very terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spandibus for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got this funny idea that I was
going to take CBD flower and smoke it with
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, like THC rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the funny thing is, is I could
smoke whole joints of rosin like a half
[SPEAKER_00]: gram or a gram of rosin with a big old CBD
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could smoke those to my head and
smoke them all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sit there and smoke them for 45
minutes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't get me over the top high
with some of the things that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I would have smoked a real traditional
hash hole, it would have gotten me way too
[SPEAKER_00]: high, way too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBD kind of balances it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was still super lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like CBD doesn't completely cancel out the
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's like a 50-50 thing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like fighting like, oh, I want to get
you high, but I'm trying to heal you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and so Eric and I, we've been
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start breeding one-to-ones
specifically for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I really kind of like that effect
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious as to the rosin that's CBD
rosin that has the CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The homie he grows, he does some CBD
rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Hawaiian candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny with hash holes, they really
taste good all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like flower that tastes good all
the way to the bottom, but like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it hasn't lost a bit of flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it still tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing I was going to tell
you about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like remember, we're talking about certain
flowers and certain strains across them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They give you certain healing ailments.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same thing with hash holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, the flowers main terpene is
XYZ.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main terpene of the rosin that
you're going to pair with it is ABC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those two together create LMNOP.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it creates a different
blend, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what it does is it creates like,
you know, we say the anxiety, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: creates uplifting energy, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it creates you wanting to eat,
creates different, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: different type of like energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what does it word for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the synergistic effect, the entourage
effect, how it blends together and all
[SPEAKER_00]: works together in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have a subjective experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we can smoke the same thing
and get a different experience because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have different body chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but that being said, I feel like some
of these things, you have a similar effect
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, it's like, but it's hard
for doctors, especially to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you should try this or this and
this, because from one person to the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might, it might not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it might not work the same,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like our cannabinoid systems are
so uniquely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our whole body chemistry is
different and understanding how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid work from a plant that's so
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just, you know, this one terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a mono terpene, one
cannabinoid, you know, doing the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this entourage effect of all of them
working together to give us these specific
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of education right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a good, it's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel like there's a lot of
research that needs to be developed on
[SPEAKER_03]: that for different, you know, purposes of
not just consuming the smoke, a household,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what are the healing properties of
that household that creates the,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what we're going to do at the talk
over there for the connect community
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the first panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the second panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because that's going to be a
really good event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to that with Sergio
and you know, we're talking about terps
[SPEAKER_00]: and flavor, you know, it's definitely deep
dives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I believe he has a special guest
come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to be bringing through some
special device and it's going to show us
[SPEAKER_03]: the carcinogens and everything of,
you know, of the pool and like,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it like how harmful it is for our body.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's pretty cool because,
you know, I'm curious to see what is it
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be like for a households.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that's subjective to the
household because like they're not all
[SPEAKER_00]: made equal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, they're not because you got to
remember households burn at a higher
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, based on the rosin or fresh
press or patella.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we urge people to take your
time when smoking them, let them cool down
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people want to rush to get
real high, get as high as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no matter what,
you're going to get high when you smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: household.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I like easing into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like taking smaller hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like, if I take too big a hit,
I don't get the full flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do like when the high comes on
gradually, if you want to get really high,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just take a couple big hits and you're
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, I think I have you coughing like
a dab, like literally like and you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, you know, because the THC is so
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'd be like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I want to go to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got I got hit in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a big, huge hit off of somebody's
household.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a joint, but I took a big hit
because I was running around so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me hit this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing you know, I'm like,
wow, I'm freaking done.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, let me sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, I'm like, I just got to do one
thing and not try to do two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a busy day that day,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had I had the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were torching s'mores and that's when I
was super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to torch the s'mores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a dab torch s'mores where we had
giant marshmallows that we torched up and
[SPEAKER_00]: got nice and brown and then put them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a whole vibe, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loaded right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year in Vegas is going to be a lot of
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bad spandibus is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Mary Jane in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need more rollers in Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already working on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you should come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got there's great cultivators out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's great flower in Germany now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to check that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to go on a tour with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's figure something out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so I have two booths,
one with Greenhouse where we're selling
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and then we're doing live podcasts
from the Grove booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll be there doing live podcasts
with other podcasters and also other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to do one for the German
people where we can show them your rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: skills and kind of show them how to roll,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we'll give them a little we'll
give them a little taste of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have their own taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these guys have their own ways of
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really good, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're backstrap rollers all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they they peel the flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they got to peel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to if you know, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I learned how to roll,
too, was that reverse the reverse roll
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sticky on the outside and peeling
the flag off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's culture out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can burn the flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to tear it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that takes skill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, literally, I be I flex on when I can
get it all the way to where it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: there's still gum line showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that's the thinnest paper
possible from from tip to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's the magic when you
can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I can roll pretty tight around
the wood crutches, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been trying to incorporate that
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to teach people like one of
those ones where like it's it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: teach people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have a feel for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's hard enough
teaching people how to roll just in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw something like,
oh, yeah, we're going to roll this in
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to roll this backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to have a piece of paper
just sticking off that you have to tear
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but it's a lot of fun, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it is, especially when you rip it and
it rips the whole thing off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, well, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hole right in the middle of the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're tearing it off and all of a
sudden you get a hole about that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, oh, I didn't see that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that two times in a row when I'm
high before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to smoke another joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to smoke one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started learning how to
reverse roll, I was in Amsterdam in 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: staying with my friend Abba.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had an apartment that I stayed in with
him there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he felt bad for me when I was rolling
joints because he was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me show you how to ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to help me because my joints were
pretty pathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they smoked, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was the culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: See the rolling culture out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just dope to see because that was
your journey of the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Started in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper crutches, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We never had glass crutches or bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had paper crutches and the rolling
papers a lot of times would come with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coffee shops had rolling papers and
crutches for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought the flower, you know,
you can get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how I learned to roll with
the, you know, and basically it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy with the cardboard because the
cardboard expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like with wood or with glass
where it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really roll it tight around
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a skill because not everybody
possesses that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's un-American to not know how
to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthony Bourdain said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the new standard, literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's a lot of people,
you know, out there that are starting
[SPEAKER_03]: their journey to the doink and learning
how to roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really cool to hear that,
you know, you learned how to roll
[SPEAKER_03]: backstrap out there in Amsterdam because
that's like literally what that's culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's culture out there to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them, they smoke spliffs too
with tobacco and hash, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pietello will blow their minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles pietello that I just made,
it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking to enter that in some
competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the hash category, traditional
hash is people's got to step up their
[SPEAKER_00]: entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the Dabidu last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple of good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some decent ones, but let's step
this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a Dabidu again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to people entering
really awesome traditional hash with
[SPEAKER_00]: either really good old school flavors or
some really good new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the same stuff as everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it, just cause it doesn't wash
doesn't mean you shouldn't wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be commercially viable to
wash, but like Skittles is a great example
[SPEAKER_00]: of something that doesn't wash very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to love it to wash it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing of passion because you want
the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people throw away, you know,
plants that are literally going to change
[SPEAKER_03]: the world's perspective on turps,
you know, and just cause it doesn't wash
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so sad that we, well, in some ways
it's so sad because we live in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on looks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that it's exacerbated everything
with social media to where you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you're like, Oh man, that's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a qualifier is the way it
looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was growing up, we had cat piss
that was shreds in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was like, I didn't care about
the way it looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted it to taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want that effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we're going back to that,
but it's like, I see the easiest way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get back to that is by people like
yourself and other people rolling joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and giving the people the experience in
the form of a joint where they don't ever
[SPEAKER_00]: have to see the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they trust the brand, they buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing it for the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really doesn't matter what that
flower looks like, or even what the rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make you feel good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it make you feel amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did it taste amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did it leave you with the great
experience to where you want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we strive for when we make
our roles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we want people to be able to
like, man, that was one of the best roles
[SPEAKER_03]: I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's the experience that you
can provide for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I try to do that with
genetics, and I love it when other people
[SPEAKER_00]: try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're on that level with other
things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus V is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to bring it up to that next
level for that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're, whether you guys know it or
not, we're creating experiences for the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what my job is,
is to create a better experience through
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is a better experience through
smoking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all ties in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of this,
is whether it's the guys that are creating
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking extracts, it's the guys that
are rolling, it's the genetics guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's so many people that touch,
there's all these touch points,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a motor, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: In order for this motor to work,
you know, everybody has to do their job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not doing your job up to
par, you know, the motor's not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: work the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people that will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, for some people,
there are people that are willing to step
[SPEAKER_00]: up and do the job and do it to the best of
their ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so competitive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People were getting by on mids 10 years
ago and that just doesn't happen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't grow the best, if you don't
roll the best, if you don't have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, it's a really tough place to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we're in California where it's
even tougher because they do the level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bar is just so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just keeps getting raised every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, you're like, I'm there and
they move the needle, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That two pounds of light is now four
pounds of light and that four pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: light will eventually be four and a half
pounds of fucking top shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got under canopy lights that
are pushing over three pounds of quality
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I never thought I'd really see that
in my life, other than maybe through
[SPEAKER_00]: octagons and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like really with technology,
they're yielding amazing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these guys growing, you know,
and grow with whatever substrates they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in with whatever nutrients they're
growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really pushing the plant forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not literally, it's really cool to
see the under canopy lighting and how to
[SPEAKER_03]: see that there really ain't no more
smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of went away from my game plan
where I'm like, okay, we're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the Keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to press that into rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to take the smalls and
we're going to roll hash hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sounds great on paper,
but you start using under canopy lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more smalls.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no more smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally it's less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas it used to be up to 25%,
sometimes more depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's down now at 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've increased your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still the trim and it's like,
so what do you do with your trim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you sell it to somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: In metric, you sell it to somebody to
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you process it yourself and turn it
into Keef?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now there's like CO2 machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use these tumblers and then
separate the Keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn that Keef into static hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Static hash is making this huge comeback
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like people are so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm like, I'm fucking with
the patella because the static hash is so
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is even better than static
hash in my opinion, but I do love a good
[SPEAKER_00]: static.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, like, that's one thing
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember mixing hash with flour and then
creating a donut or even just a nice good
[SPEAKER_03]: infused roll, you know, cause those do
the, they do the trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're saying cost-effective,
you know, we're coming, we're coming with
[SPEAKER_03]: the consumer grade only for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost-effective consumer grade only.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming because everybody wants to be
able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumer grade only instead of connoisseur
grade only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can have the spinoff of the cheap
stuff for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay, but it's still going to be good
product though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing we're going to strive
on is finding still products that are
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap enough for us to give them to them
at a cheaper price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might not be a hand rolled product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a, what do we say?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of those knockbox rolls,
but a different, but with the twist,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's so many different ones
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to come with the
conventional cone little pre-roll funky
[SPEAKER_03]: little.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to come that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always trying to come different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always going to be a different
experience regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you know, that's what it is
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're saying the experience people
want to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people want to be part of the
experience and some people can't afford,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't afford it, but that doesn't
mean they shouldn't get the experience is
[SPEAKER_00]: how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, how can we, I'm in the same
boat as you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how can we provide an
experience that's cost-effective for the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, but they still get a quality
product to where they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not that we're not trying to take
anything away from our top shelf because
[SPEAKER_00]: we could never sell our top shelf for that
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'm looking at where I,
you know, I've been talking to Artemis
[SPEAKER_00]: Copac and the guys up in Lake County about
doing pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to a couple of different
companies in metric about doing pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want to have something that's in
shops where everyone can try my product
[SPEAKER_00]: that they get a good experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sell something for three bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll go for $9 or, you know, like almost
10 bucks barely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what the average consumer wants
to spend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I went and did these demos for my
brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked these consumers, I was like,
Hey, what's your average, what price do
[SPEAKER_03]: you usually spend for a pre-roll?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, eight bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, mine's 30 with tax.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the funny thing is,
is we probably both smoke $50 joints on
[SPEAKER_00]: our, like we would, they would be $50
retail in most of the shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we smoke on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't afford to, in most cases,
we can't afford to give that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that we can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most consumers don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're okay with, they're, they want
something at a cheaper price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's similar quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're okay with the stuff that's,
I feel like we get this special,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next time people are okay with the
next down and it's still really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing is like, it's still
really, really good, really good genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good rosin, all this stuff,
but it's not always that top top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's where like,
you know, now everybody wants to,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you said, now everybody wants to
spend 50 bucks with tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like $70.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost, you know, with California taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're, we came with the one
gram, but the point too, at like 30 bucks
[SPEAKER_03]: with tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you still get the same experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the jumbo roll, but it's still a
roll that will last about a good 20
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still get the top flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still get the top rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top flower, top rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you still get that experience,
but at a better rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I, I've seen it, you know,
like people are spending 70 bucks,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you have to understand the average
consumer is only making about $50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even $50,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're spending their last 40,
50 bucks for the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they needed to go far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed to go far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the hundred dollar ounces are
really popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got Dave from Preferred
Gardens who's leading the way with all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get in line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get some rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get some material with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have great, great,
great roll, roll material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like their product is amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their price point is good and you get
a good experience with their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had them on our show and they,
you know, they, we, we used to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: blind tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the show in the beginning and there's
definitely one, we had smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I think the $10 eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was fucking mind blowing how good
it was for the quality for the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top quality for the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be people like that
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's still people that do want
to spend the big numbers, but these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: this day and age, there's less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's less and less of the
people that want to spend a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars on an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but there's a, there's a little
market for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's guys that buy a thousand dollar
ounces still.
[SPEAKER_00]: $1,800 ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have some of those elite ones
selling for $500 an ounce and shops very
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds nice to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, but that's something,
but I still want to have something for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think as it evolves,
I think a lot of people are going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: for convenience and they want stuff that's
in a cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want stuff that's in a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my next product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like thinking of making carts,
you know, carts because people love things
[SPEAKER_03]: on the go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Convenience is key to access
accessibility, being able to do as you
[SPEAKER_03]: please when you're on the go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, you know, when you're at a
Dodgers game or you're at a basketball
[SPEAKER_03]: game and you're at the hockey game or
you're, you know, you're just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're at your kid's freaking softball
game and you want to hit the pen real
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hit the pen and it's like nothing,
you know, it's like a vape to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely, I feel like it's one
of the bigger markets right now that along
[SPEAKER_03]: with the pre-rolls and then, you know,
obviously flower is always going to be one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the biggest markets, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's so funny because that space is
so competitive with the pens and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that are putting $10 rosin,
it's outdoor rosin in against guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: are putting, you know, really expensive
rosin in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, where do you fit in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is outdoor rosin better than indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is indoor, I think... Man, it's
subjective, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I love some good full
term outdoor rosin, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's some, you cannot replicate
the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these guys have some
interesting dip techniques where they dip
[SPEAKER_00]: it in different containers to actually
clean it off before they freaking go in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ice.
Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the freeze drying techniques and
some of these things these guys are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to create a cleaner, a better
product from an outdoor material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I work with some guys
that just did like freaking kill it with
[SPEAKER_00]: their indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like even with the Skittles,
you know, it's like next level Z,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and then that Z rosin from the Z
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bro, I love putting strain with
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of good washers now
people got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dirty Skittles is fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd call it golden Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff is so heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just reminds me of like a great
summertime Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, it almost tastes like
you're smoking rosin with it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so turpy, but it has this mouth coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely special.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of reminds me of almost like a
floral Z, but like it's just that mouth
[SPEAKER_03]: coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't wait till you try the ZDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, yeah, you like that,
that dirty Skittles, which is not to stain
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty Skittles by, by Lempire,
but it's my, the dirt soil grown Skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: by my boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, next level, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fucking, uh, ZDP does sound good right
about now, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, and it's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, yeah, we're going to,
we're going to have to dive in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the one that Marco rolled
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go, this is the Crippi with
the Piatella.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's one of the best joint
rollers I'd know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally blown away by the way these things
burn, the way they taste and the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all about experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: You literally just barely lit that thing
and it combusted right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like check out the oil rings already right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just literally excreting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to blow on it a little bit before I
even take the first rip to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely just to see how that cherry is
blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how that ash is burning, how the
cherry is blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the cherry is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it when you see it go from like the
dark color to white ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you know it's combusting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you see how there's a gap from the,
uh, from the oil, the oil ring to the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual end of the paper where it meets
the, uh, ember.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see that gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you know it's, uh,
it's performing, it's, it's performing
[SPEAKER_03]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got this unique flavor too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can already taste the Z in it
with the Crippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this the Zippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's about to hit across America
with different fucking states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, definitely in LA at some of the
dispensaries down there and the Zippy is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make its rounds, uh, in both
flour and rosin.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm excited.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a brand out of, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a clothing brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have bad passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does the, he does his stuff out of,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's mostly out of LA, but like,
yeah, we're doing some collabs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Zippy is one of them and it's going to be
some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm excited, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you were talking about the
cannabis brothers earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely going to be getting some
collabs with them going some great,
[SPEAKER_03]: get some good OGs going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's one thing Northern
California needs as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have a couple of stores out
in LA, you know, only two, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've got cookies Melrose and we got,
we roll up Culver city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're going to have two,
you got two good ones right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it, it's not about how many
stores you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the, which ones, you know,
it's, it's all about the quality of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and it's, I'm really excited to be
able to bring some OGs up here cause we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really have too many, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm the only one with OG up here these
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, so like, and that's what I
want to give the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be able to give them at least
like three strains of OG, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right now of roles, one flower,
one hash hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pairs so well with all the different
rosins out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter whether it's you can go
GMO with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go papaya with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go great gas with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some hashburgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love that Donnie burger too,
in the form of rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big flower fan, as I've said
before on my show, but I really love it,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good in rosin, like even straight
dabs, but like it's one of those ones you
[SPEAKER_00]: can blend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put that with some OG and it would
taste amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: This right here tastes amazing,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got, and so that's uniquely
different too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's got the gas underneath,
but it's got something else too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it's very smooth though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's a mouth coat for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's got the Skittles pietella right
down the middle, you put a big old.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like creamy Z, but with earthiness on
the back end, when you like blow it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like right here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, there's a little bit of
pine and the earth is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roadkill Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roadkill Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some roadkill Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see roadkill anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's like, I got the roadkill.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it looked, looked like some
roadkill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got the crazy, and it just
dumps too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine how it dumps because
the thing looked like it was covered in
[SPEAKER_03]: trikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even just in the bottom of the
bags, like when you're fucking with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the bags have trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like old, old school on the
Turkey bag where you can scrape it with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like white razor blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could scrape the trikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how safe that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're breaking it down pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love weed like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes it a little bit harder to
roll, but depending on the humidity of the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and how it's actually cured,
because sometimes you have to let certain
[SPEAKER_03]: weed cure a little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those, the trikes are not, I wouldn't
say like dried out, but that they're more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're dehydrated a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more, it basically would be more
dehydrated, but it's more of a stable type
[SPEAKER_03]: of stickiness compared to where if you,
you literally press it down one time and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's stuck just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the viscosity is totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have that sticky versus like
sticky versus like sticky and tacky versus
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like stuff that just fucking wants
to liquefy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes Skittles Rosin wants to
liquefy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's rare that, you know,
you see it more stable because it's got so
[SPEAKER_00]: many turps for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all oily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing right there is like the oil
ring is bursting and I'm excited to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we got a donut or a nipple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got a donut in there, dawg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a donut.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the donut going to be in there,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it like, we'll give it like two more
rounds of us going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing's probably going to start
tasting like straight Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so strong too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm knocking a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's strong, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's good strong, but it's fucking
strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing is smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see how high it is from the paper to
the, where the oil ring is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you know the temperature of
the, of the, the core heat temperature is
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Optimal temps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That creepy is, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's performing really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause even with cultivation, it's,
it's from one genetic, you can have it
[SPEAKER_00]: grown by one guy to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy could cure it right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could have a really good or a
really bad product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cure is critical, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some, like you were saying,
but some stuff you can, you can smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: right after you harvest, like Skittles
quick, faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it almost the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can get a little bit of a cure
and it's great still, but like I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes it might get a little
smoother, even if you go like two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: after, but like you want the freshest,
loudest turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that's my favorite with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas some of these other varieties,
you want to cure them a good three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: or four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, they're optimal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain strains that like,
you wouldn't want to smoke your right
[SPEAKER_03]: away, but like with Z definitely that's
one you could just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff in Vegas was fresh fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Vegas with the, with that
dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just mouth coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: 53 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: 53.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's quick turnaround,
especially when sour is just so much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love good sour though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's making it come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, it is definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: People want the real sour though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much mediocre, you know,
like we've seen even, even a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends have sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not like the real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is the real sour cut, it's,
they're not making express real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave from Budge of Arab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought some real sour in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get some more real sour from
him shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those ones that the effect
from sour is what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most, even though I love the flavor
and everything else, that effect is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: morning weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's afternoon weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evening weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weekend weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those ones where I smoke it,
especially the way he grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can literally smoke it any time of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't feel like I get memory loss
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some strains they make, I have to
think about stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be forgetting some shit when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have to stop smoking
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gets me too loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the balance, you know, and it's like
certain genetics work better for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that kind of stuff, especially when
I'm doing podcasts all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do mushroom coffee in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go with that stuff right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your mind right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for memory recall, especially,
and basically being able to recall that
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to think about it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually just speak without trying
to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so mushrooms have really, what brand
is that rise?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do R Y Z E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a shout out, but not an advertisement
rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends turned me on to it a little
while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I love the mushroom blend that
they have in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried it and then stopped and didn't
feel quite the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went back on and I feel really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You felt the real effects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it in the morning and instead of
mixing it with hot water, I do mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: with protein powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do grass fed protein powder,
transparent labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that and blend that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, pretty much it's been a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost 50 pounds over the last year and I
lost it really slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, they lose it really fast
within two or three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've lost a bunch of weight in
like literally a month before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I did it this time, I lost it
really gradually with five to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can watch my old podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you literally watched from last year at
this time to now, it's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, I'm not gonna lie, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have from when I seen you last year
over there and I think it was Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sitting down with the other
gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I think it was Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was because it was on the
street right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, what's up, James?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're chilling with your friend and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're a little bit, you know,
bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't lose muscle was the one thing
I really didn't want to lose muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, I've maintained most of
my muscle mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost a couple pounds, but out of 50,
that's normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people lose like half of their muscle
mass or whatever equal amount of muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't about to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your muscles would keep you taut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do Jiu-Jitsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Muscle memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't, doesn't really lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it takes is a lot of protein and
working out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a lot of working out,
a lot of, a lot of putting in them hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a guy that likes to get on that
fucking treadmill either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even high, like I smoke weed in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that'll get me there and I have to
listen to music, but like 30 minutes can
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like an hour sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I go do Jiu-Jitsu or I go box,
it's like, it's a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I definitely, I feel like it's way
more hands-on, you know, more,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like you're really in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, the beauty of that stuff is,
especially with cannabis, like one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: like is like a small dab before I go do
cardio.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to do cardio or whether it's
Jiu-Jitsu, boxing, whatever, I'll do some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if I'm going to hit pads,
even it's like, I basically will take a
[SPEAKER_00]: hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't even remember that I took
a hit and I'm hyper focused on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I'm not thinking about
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not thinking about anything,
but what I'm doing right there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we all need to find
something, some form of meditation to get
[SPEAKER_00]: us into the present, to get us into the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so important.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis can bring you in the moment
real quick too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like big dabs will bring you right in the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should smack you right dab in the
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody has one of those
experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like as humans, we all do have
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about one of the one time,
like one of the first times you got high
[SPEAKER_00]: on X jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it must've been like when there
wasn't really no temp readers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, and titanium nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like hot ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the bells and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That the cap, the metal cap on top with
the, you know, the titanium nail with the
[SPEAKER_03]: bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking like this was like 2010s when
they had those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like around that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like, um, like how, like,
you know, it would just like the snot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would just be, cause it was like
900, 800, like you don't even know what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're taking it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was red hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would take red hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was guys, this even in the early
days of Instagram, I remember this dude
[SPEAKER_00]: who used to make torches and somebody will
know his name in the chat, but he used to
[SPEAKER_00]: make torches and he used to take these one
gram or two grams snakes and put them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the titanium Niles right down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the only way you could
really smoke those that that much is if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're burning it hot like that,
because that shit take like, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, if you have any one of these new
modern rigs with the, or like basically
[SPEAKER_00]: with the, with the bangers or the Terp
slurps is like two grams in a Terp slurp,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going to have to heat it up
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely do for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: See if there's a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, this is the great reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pink or is it blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we do have a little hole here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a monster piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fat asshole in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably way bigger in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was going to, because I could
tell the texture of it, it would make a
[SPEAKER_03]: nice little hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that nice toffee texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really pliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make snakes and shapes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the rosin, like me learning how to
roll hash holes, I've been, I've gotten a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot better, but even still, it's like
using it where you don't have a snake
[SPEAKER_00]: where the rosin isn't pliable,
where you have to scoop it out and drop
[SPEAKER_00]: like beads in there to get the,
get the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it's been a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get it really, cause you want to
get it straight where you roll it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're rolling the actual flower over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be centered and that's not
always easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, just based on that,
that like, cause some, like we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about some flowers more fluffy and
some is more dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So depending on how it is, that's why we,
we, we have the donut press for people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are like beginner novice rollers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to get the weed into a form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you selling those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we sell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're creating, yeah, we're going to be
creating packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're first, we're coming with the new
packaging because we've just been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like selling them, like the
press and the, and the tamper together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, they're, they're, yeah,
those are, you guys make those here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're a us made.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go through, I go through third dab
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's we've been doing it for no tariffs,
guys, no tariffs, you know, tapping
[SPEAKER_03]: custom, custom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Designs your own logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go have your own product.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you would like come with your own
tampers, I'll line you up, get you some
[SPEAKER_03]: James loud presses and everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would love to discuss putting
together a little kit for people on our
[SPEAKER_00]: website that we collab on and we put,
I'm all about collaboration these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, if we do stuff, you're the,
you're the roller guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, for me, I feel like it's not
as authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I start putting out, okay, all this,
these rolling tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can collaborate with somebody and
we can do it together, it's, it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: much more fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that much more authentic and
authenticity sells these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, people, they, they respect that
more and they understand it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can appreciate it in the club
collaboration model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The collaboration model really is the
future with everything that we're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because now we don't all have to be
experts at everything to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, dude, this is a beautiful hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice fat hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all don't have to be experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can do what I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do what you're good at,
you know, and we can even work under the
[SPEAKER_00]: same umbrella potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the beauty of these guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our brand is based on a lot of
collaboration, you know, with all a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of different cultivators and hash
makers throughout California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so cool is having these
relationships, you know, with all these
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing brands and it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely always down for a collab,
you know, let's get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be working in multiple
states and multiple countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the potential is just so big for
collaborating with people these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like we're working on
Australia, Germany, and Thailand are the
[SPEAKER_00]: next three places we're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany is big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends are already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends are helping out and it's like,
it's good having friends in high places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good having friends that are in the
industry in other States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like bringing their brands here
and bringing my brand over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of work, you know,
collaborating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collaboration, you know, is really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about, you know, just taking your
time and making it happen, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in that effort, putting in those
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone holding their end of the
bargain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like working with good people that
compliment your brand that are willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the hours as much as you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not definitely the passion has to be
there, you know, passion, the hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, you could love it all you
want, but if you're not going to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: get up and grind, it's like, these are the
days where we grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people are missing
some of the stuff in the sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these aren't the times to relax,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in an unstable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our economy isn't doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the day to grind, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't grind today, you better get
up and grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you may not have a job if you don't
for one thing, but also if you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing that's going to stop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you may have to grind
for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to grind for five years,
but there is light at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great space to be in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, I got into the industry,
I've been in the industry for a few years,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like I was mainly like a
construction worker for awhile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, it's a lot of work,
you know, doing construction, building
[SPEAKER_03]: custom homes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, you know, I love weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather be around weed, you know,
and I'd rather be around the plant or
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out how I can do it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could still remember the
conversation is like, I wanted to be in
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: How am I going to get in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at first I didn't know, like I
wanted to try and grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried growing, wasn't too good at it
because the flowering process part is,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of time and a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of knowledge you got to educate
yourself on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, okay, I'm not too good at
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me figure something else out that's
going to be easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I met the homie who went to go
smoke and he had a Fiddle's Hashell and he
[SPEAKER_03]: had it all tied up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: All tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah, he's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some fucking stories about some all
tied up fucking adventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you got contacts, I would love to
get him on the show, all tied up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some history with his brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know him personally, but he's kind
of the guy that fucking set all this off,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, to where we're at these days with
Hashells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know, definitely, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like one of the biggest
inspirations for me along with like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so when he had it and I'm like,
oh man, I want to smoke one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been wanting to smoke one of those
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, boom, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not enough rollers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not enough people curating,
making amazing shit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stills not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stills not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you're 100% right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being in this space, you need to be a
solution to a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be a solution to a much bigger
problem and you're going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're a solutions-based
business, you're a lot better than just
[SPEAKER_00]: being a hype business that's trying to do
what everybody else is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like you're in the perfect place
at the perfect time because I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: with this unstable market where it's going
into rec, we have this product that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in high demand no matter what
on all these levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always have machines to do the
pre-rolls, but the high-end stuff is still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to be done by hand no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited for the future for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we literally, I won't say that me
myself, but a lot of the big rollers out
[SPEAKER_03]: there that are doing it and myself,
we created a whole roller's economy within
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a whole other subculture in the
industry now just for households and
[SPEAKER_03]: doinks and flower rolls and just
handcrafted products that are something
[SPEAKER_03]: that people are very proud of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like art.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can't wait to see different
small brands turn into big brands for the
[SPEAKER_03]: California rec market and then therefore
wherever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because pretty soon, the laws are going to
be changing and everything's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not in the industry,
you're out of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a certain point where you're
not going to be getting back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry if you're not in it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I believe 100%,
I wholeheartedly believe that if you make
[SPEAKER_00]: it through these times, you are going to
be very successful if you're in this
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to suck it up and it's going
to suck for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a brand that's growing right now,
because we're a small brand, it's just me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have no investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have really nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, but it's gradually getting
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting bigger now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've literally locked in big accounts for
different cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we're in over 30 plus stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started out with five and now we're
like 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just going to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a small brand, I just tell people,
keep working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep collaborating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let your head get bigger than your
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just stay humble and keep working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persistence pays off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting up every day and working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like even when you want to give
up, the tough days are the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: to get up and go grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't stay home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't stay home in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't do it anyway, because I work
seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hanging out, no getting
depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the days where I do have... So I have
days where I'm depressed, but I can't do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're human, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's big to just say.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're human, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anxiety and depression and our own self
guilt of not feeling like we meet
[SPEAKER_03]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of society's measures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard because we're human,
and everybody wants us to perform at
[SPEAKER_03]: exceptional levels on a day to day basis,
every day, literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some days aren't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's big for us as men.
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't a lot of space for us to talk
about our emotions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely you guys, make sure you tell
you guys out there, make sure you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about that with someone that you
love, man, because it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Men's health is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially these days, I feel like it's so
easy to get caught up in the news,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the media, in social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of these things are really
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we live a reality outside of each one
of these things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all an illusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things are an illusion and all
these things are just part of a much
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so funny because if you read too
much into the news and you get all scared
[SPEAKER_00]: and freaked out and stuff, you can get
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lit on fire when I hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That motherfucker combusted it to a big
ass flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that's what's up though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some fire right here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see the flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get the run back on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to make that a short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instant replay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing is magical though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a, it's still smoking,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing is crazy slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pietella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done a hash hole with it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first one, but it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, yeah, that was going to be
a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch this guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to roll too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you can do those snakes like
that, it's like, it's a perfect,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's honestly perfect texture right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just like nice little like 0.3s
with like a 1.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using my atom smasher with it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got an old atom smasher where you
heat the rod up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we used to smoke dabs too in
hash back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heat the rod up and you put it in the
bowl and the side instead of a hole in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, it's got it in the side of the
wall of the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you hit it, the smoke goes through
there and I got, I got a bong attachment
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got the pipe and I just,
I love that style.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's from the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do all kinds of crazy shit back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still have the hookah from back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the hookah for hash and uh,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do the hot piece of coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the hot with the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the coal going and it's burning
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of blow on it, let it cool down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put your dab on with the
fucking little tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like it's like fricking,
what is that hookah?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like hookah, but with fucking
with dabs and with hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was pre raw.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we never had a big lump of fricking
hash on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do that with back in the night
and then the butter, the whipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff was so strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a solventless rosin.
Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love the rosin now and I love
the solventless rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these levels of just from the hair
straightener to what we have now with
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys with their presses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the rosin makers out
there for doing the Lord's work in many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the machines that do it now,
dude, it's like pulling bags and these
[SPEAKER_00]: things these guys do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really impressive to the level that
they've taken it from where it was when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just original hash styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel like there's different
levels to hash, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, when you got machine made hash
compared to handmade hash, like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely a little bit different,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some machines, I mean, I know there's some
good machines out there that make that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it like?
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they separate it through like
electricity or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Static electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use a plasma plasma separators with
static electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sambo Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know about you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, that shit's wild, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Static hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit's crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know how they used to make
static hash originally before the,
[SPEAKER_00]: before the machine, the plasma machine is
like you'd have a glove and you'd rub it
[SPEAKER_00]: around on parchment with the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go brush it into a bowl and
they'd like, dude, like this serious labor
[SPEAKER_00]: going into making the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's pretty amazing stuff
where you're able to separate those heads
[SPEAKER_00]: with static electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, what would that one piece
[SPEAKER_00]: be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an original answer, but hell yeah,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all knew about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most of us did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew about it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, we'd be rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, man, just don't give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everything gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets worse and then it gets
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ups and downs, smiles and frowns,
you know, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're persistent enough, you're going
to get where you want to be in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one thing I do say is spend the
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't save it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spend it because you can make more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Memories are worth more than money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow's not promised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told by somebody once that money's
value is in its use and not in its
[SPEAKER_00]: possession.
[SPEAKER_03]: That part definitely is, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Cousin Ed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks, Darryl, because them guys
right there educated me all on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's all about purpose of what
you use your money for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, if you really want to
succeed, then make sure you use that money
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you start learning about
inflation, especially these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to figure out how to invest your
money and how to use it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it can be used as a very
positive tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used in a positive way,
in a positive light to make your world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place than the people around you,
because really we're alive to live on,
[SPEAKER_00]: have experiences and to make the world of
the lives around us a lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was like, man, content is
key, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates a lot of avenues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, man, I really appreciate
the opportunity, dude.
