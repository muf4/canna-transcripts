[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Lance, and he works
with Turplock now, but we've known each
[SPEAKER_01]: other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Lance?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoked to finally be up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's great having you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess let's start off talking about
Spain in 2019, the best interview I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever done that never aired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that was frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need to hit up Peter for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was, I had known about you,
both of us, you know, being from the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: Area and background and kind of similar
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I saved up for college thanks to
flower, thanks to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been following you for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Peter's like, Hey, you got to
interview James?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, dude, I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're like right across from where
we were set up with the company I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, you're, you're doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice to see a domestic genetics
company in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, you know, we don't have to go
too far now because you know all about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but you know, there's two epicenters
as far as I'm concerned with genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain's one and California is the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know if you're
not familiar with spandibus, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: started out as a protestable, like most
international, but I just did an audit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21% of the exhibitors are genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you know, you notice that when
you're walking through it, cause we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done several of them over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you put that in perspective,
it's like one out of five booths are
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about five different companies make
the seats for all of them.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, exactly true as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them come up and some people
know that and some people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but again, to see that American
representation, there's a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, but you're on an awesome
trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the thing that I've always
been a fan about as far as what you do is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the genetics that you're into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm into the generational stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm talking about more of the land
race, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco gold and Swahili and Durban
poison and just all these genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: really were at the core back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that interview, I had taken a micro
dose of what I thought was a micro dose of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the funny part of the story is
that I was high on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was talking to Mario and to
Jai, they were arguing actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, I got to get out of
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next thing you know, you're
grabbing my arm and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to do this interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, okay, let's try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you ended up giving me a hug
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I think it's the best
interview I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, I think it was a really
good interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went away and you came back
maybe an hour later and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, we didn't have the sound to the
sound of the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the sound from the camcorder,
but that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's frustrating that the guy who was on
site there that Peter hired, which he
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously did not hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we lost quite a bit on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some of the best interviews
to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was so natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of us, not to speak for you,
but I feel like we're both very
[SPEAKER_00]: approachable and personable and we're
about good vibes and we're about
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to be from NorCal to
have this mentality, but there's enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: us to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get a few of us together,
it just flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not scripted.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes talking about like deviating
from talking about genetics and talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the passion for the sacred plant and
you know, why we're all doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, sometimes that gets
overlooked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and it, you know,
I just went to three days of dead in
[SPEAKER_01]: company and I think we're here in part to
the Grateful Dead and their, their
[SPEAKER_01]: influence on the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, brands like Anchor Steam
that we just found out Anchor Steam is now
[SPEAKER_01]: closing doors after 130 years or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and Fred Maytag, he's a big
contributor to the reason cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about that a little bit
before this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was telling you, you know,
when I, people ask me and I love doing
[SPEAKER_00]: these interviews during 420 because people
feel like they're still a mystique and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't quite know the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, the story is very
factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're, so I'm from Marin County,
you know, San Anselmo, which is right next
[SPEAKER_00]: to San Rafael and in the Waldo's like we
were discussing, you know, who went to
[SPEAKER_00]: school at San Rafael High and,
you know, eyes over Sir Francis Drake,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're a little bit older than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm friends with one of their
daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were classed as 71, but it's
like, no, we know this history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're looking for the lost crop
out at the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that all of a sudden they
started, you know, one of the guys started
[SPEAKER_00]: touring as a roadie with the dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of took 420 to that national
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's just, there is a history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing I like that nobody
argues is like, this really is the
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenter for the culture and craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the country is falling behind on
legalization and I contribute that to
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you have over three dozen
countries that have legalized already
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world, but no one can argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and you know this, you traveled too,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Thailand in January and people
were like, you're from NorCal,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, they know humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: South America, they know humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some know the triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few know Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm like, do you know the Emerald
Triangle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually three counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, can you name it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You always love poison people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of history and there's a
lot of influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, post summer love,
post hippie hill, and it carried through
[SPEAKER_00]: from that 60s, 70s and still today with
what guys like you were doing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Late 80s, early 90s?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was either 89 or 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a young teen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had older siblings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, pros and cons to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started partying a little bit
younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, like we've talked about,
like I said, you know, mine back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, it was tough because we got some good
stuff off the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as kids, it was like, either you got
stuff from south of the border,
[SPEAKER_00]: the brick weed, you know, Mexi tire,
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at the time for me, the coveted was,
was Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was really hot back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you would come across a little,
again, a little Swahili or maybe someone
[SPEAKER_00]: had some Durban or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, that was my early experience was
either you're going to be totally blasted
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can consume it all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a lot of times it was green
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're buying green bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought green bud and it could have been
any name, you know, not really knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was those green and brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was green and brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's snap, crackle,
pop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember, and I'm going to say,
man, the kids these days don't know we
[SPEAKER_00]: went up the hill, you know, two miles in
snow, both ways to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be like a fallen old
head, but dude, we were picking out sticks
[SPEAKER_00]: and stems and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, of course we tried to grow
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you did just like I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's good stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I would had more stuff saved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the, especially, you know,
some of the Mexican stuff that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, I mean, there's a lot of good
genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't grown necessarily the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't cured or dried properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would get you really high,
but a lot of times you get a headache from
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a strong, debilitating headache,
you know, tight behind the eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: not like headband, but like tight,
like in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, in something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, yeah, it was different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I remember slinging and it's
something, it's interesting, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I didn't even, I think we talked
about it before, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out of the proverbial green closet
in the teens, you know, because while
[SPEAKER_00]: flower was a big part of my life growing
up and growing here, I mean, I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: going down and boarding in Half Moon Bay,
my buddy's uncle grew in Scott's Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd swing by there on the way to
Capitola for pizza, my heart, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these memories of hanging out
with these old heads that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing some fantastic stuff and the bud
wasn't highly manicured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sure as hell wasn't indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was either hoop or outdoor in their
garden buried between, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's nostalgic,
but it definitely has changed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your point sometimes it's just,
it was green or it was brown and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, we, so we used to drive down for
eighths of weed into Santa Cruz and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: called the strawberry, but it was skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a skunk, but it was, the reason it
was called strawberry was because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry sized nuggets had nothing to do
with the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the skunk weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the skunk weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, you know, what I would,
you know, people say roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, but this stuff was strong skunk,
not cat piss that had the ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just straight skunk and it tasted
skunk down to the roach and one little bud
[SPEAKER_01]: of it would just smell everything up,
which you don't really see stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you don't man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting what some of the guys are
smoking up on the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I go up there and still, and you
know, it was a little more popular a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years back, but forbidden fruits,
a good example of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we talk about the stuff and I was
telling some, it was so, I really felt my
[SPEAKER_00]: age, but in a good way when I,
so you were at the dead ahead over the
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at Northern nights music festival,
which is heavy music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, you know, some great bands and
some great DJs, but the undertone is
[SPEAKER_00]: health and wellness and culture and craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes place on the border of humble
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're in the heart of Emerald
triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sitting kind of preaching to these
kids and telling them some of the stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, there was a reason
why genetics morphed and changed over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years, especially in the eighties with the
wand drugs, because the guys that were
[SPEAKER_00]: grown up on the hill, they need to be
mindful of the smell and the way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to grow now under hoop now
undercover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the indoor guys though, cause there
was no filtration like we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even in the nineties, we did have
filtration, but it didn't always work
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and we won't call it names of
specific brands, but there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are killing it with that
filtration and you wouldn't be any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: wiser for what's being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but one cultivar going back to his
forbidden fruit and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was explained to him and it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of, I love quizzing people cause
I'm a facts guy, but I love sharing and
[SPEAKER_00]: educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, do you know what the median
THC is of, of legal flower across this
[SPEAKER_00]: country?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I asked these five guys and
they're all part of the production team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been around it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, one's like,
Oh, 25%, 21, 23%, 40%, 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, the median THC levels,
21%, not that everything revolves around
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, so take forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think the median THC is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go through a whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike is about 15, 16%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpene percentage, we're talking
5%, six, when the median is like 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started explaining to them,
you know, if, if cannabinoids are the
[SPEAKER_00]: engine, the terpenes are the steering
wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone's putting an emphasis on THC,
but be mindful of those smells and those
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, because that's what the real
experiential is with the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just like mind, I started
talking about all the different terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, and there was an old head there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like this guy was named Fred.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing AV for all kinds of shows
and huge dead fan of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I don't even understand
what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, lemon to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Merson what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he, I'm like, dude, you need to learn
your terp profile, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have that much better of an
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a whole evolution compared to
what we grew up with, with what's
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible now, both by product and
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different world now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of stuff is hype driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, so you get a little bit
of everything, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is quality and it's hard to,
argue quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now quality is subjective to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor is subjective, but I feel like
quality, you know, it's like, if the,
[SPEAKER_01]: if the, if the roach tastes good,
when you fire it back up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got some good stuff on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just burnt and it's sad and you
want to just keep it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree in your, you're spot on with
the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't mean to knock it,
but I call them trendy triangle strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went down this road of all these
candies and desserts and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some great genetics that
kind of got overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I feel like GMO didn't get enough
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light, you know, because so many
people are wrapped up in wedding cake,
[SPEAKER_00]: then ice cream cake, then gelato,
you have 41 and now RS.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was with different groups too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like GMO really with our,
with my friends, with Marlon, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my good friend, Marlon Asher,
like he loved GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but, but yeah, I guess to a degree,
I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that was another one that
really didn't peak like it should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get as much credit as it should
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you compare it to Skittles in
Rontz and you're like, is almost or GG,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they're not back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, it gets hyped up and it
gets into the social media bubble and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are going after it for the wrong
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's also the experience
again, talking on the legal market,
[SPEAKER_00]: when people walk in and they're asking,
I call it PC, you know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants, but bud tenders, you know,
Hey, what, what should we smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're telling them what the loudest
thing is to smoke or what the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not saying, Hey, are you
trying to get help with sleep or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a knee injury or how high do you want
to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: How high do you want to get to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like you were talking about earlier,
man, you're spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, you know, when you're
smoking something like Skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm a huge fan of as well,
it's just this nice cool cruise,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like out of your head,
but then you throw in something like green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack and someone isn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, what did you give me,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going on a whole other level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, green crack is one of those ones
that your body will adapt to it really
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you haven't been smoking it,
it gets you super high and it peaks really
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it drops down actually too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, it, it'll get you to the point
where you need to sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just take it all in and it,
and everybody's body is different too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling that same group of kids,
I was like, you know, my friend came
[SPEAKER_00]: across, it was a GDP, which I know I love
the, the old true purple, like purple
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel and grandaddy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is a GDP crossed with Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained the two different genetics
and lineages of those both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, it was one of those cultivars
where I smoked it and I had to lay down
[SPEAKER_00]: and listen to Jimi Hendrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was just, that was the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like this, every once in a
while you get into that perfect balance of
[SPEAKER_00]: heady and body, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that perfect heady body for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell people, if you find that
perfect strain, stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what your body wants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may not be the perfect strain
forever because it's all, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of those things that we can be,
it should be consumed fresh and each batch
[SPEAKER_01]: is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting the same expression
every time, especially grown, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: boutique flower, you know, and then even
the commercial stuff, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think of plant flowers for roughly
70 days, there's a lot that can happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: those 70 days, even in an indoor
environment to where it can be slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm at the mercy of, I'm an outdoor
and it's nothing, I have a level of
[SPEAKER_00]: respect for, for DAP and indoor,
but I'm a traditional outdoor full term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good example of that to your point,
I was given some first round genetics from
[SPEAKER_00]: a guy out of Santa Cruz, thanks to Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Hey, well you test run these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, I kind of stick to
land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, it's a good cross and
it's a zi huat neo with a tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know how I was going to
express and I didn't know what to feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, we got hit with a heat
wave in SoCal, which a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're so lucky Lance, you get to do,
you know, you've got the perfect climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not exactly when you're hitting
triple digits and you're hotter than Vegas
[SPEAKER_00]: in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we got hit last year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's been some rough summers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the last, the year before that I
went to 120 in fall break.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was down there and you're like,
so my friends were working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what came out of that versus if I were
to rerun that now this season with El
[SPEAKER_00]: Nino, like you said, it's, it's two
different, the expression, cause people
[SPEAKER_00]: put, and again, the, the genotype is a
huge factor, but geno-feno-chemo there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these different elements on how
you experienced these inputs that comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, an outdoor is like making wine in
the sense that we talk terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we talk about climate and weather
and all these things that contribute to
[SPEAKER_01]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, beyond drying and curing,
there's so much that goes on with outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's different every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to have good vintages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have bad vintages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a lot of stuff in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even growing the same exact genetics,
you're going to get stuff all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place every year, no matter what.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it in your bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a friend, Greg, he's down in
Santa Cruz and kind of wild, something I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't think in that climate,
but he went with a Kugelgroh format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, yeah, it took these logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them soak all through winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm growing these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, he got these gens,
he got these pucks that he is running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, one of them, he's going to
fully bomb because it's just the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: expresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that thing's like, I don't know,
four and a half foot now, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: siblings are like three foot at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the same bed and it's in the
same grow format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's used, so the same media,
the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, the variants are great
and especially outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a little jealous of the,
I call it God growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm dependent on mother nature,
but the God growing indoor, where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: control the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying it's easy, but you see
that uniformity, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you need from a medicine standpoint,
which I'm a medical, I'm not an activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical advocate first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fully respect that again,
because if you have grand mal seizures,
[SPEAKER_00]: cerebral palsy, like if you find something
that works and then someone goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah, no, this is GG4.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not GG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe the genetics, but it's from a
completely different grower, growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, growing is half the battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you cure it, how you dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you're into it,
but I age my blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually do two, two, and then two
months of aging, which I learned from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Italians, like, but how you handle it,
like that really factors into your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a medical patient, that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really big into aging, not because
I want to age it, but because the
[SPEAKER_01]: quantities, you know, it's like,
I want to, some stuff I want to save,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the most part, I want to smoke the
best of stuff I have right at that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, leading into TerpLock,
you know, it's kind of a game changer
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm a mason jar guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was, you know, I use mason jars
forever and I was very skeptical of the
[SPEAKER_01]: TerpLock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mentioned on my podcast, which will
be two podcasts ago, TerpLock and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple other ones, but I did
side-by-side testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you keep it at the same
temperature, the TerpLock has more Terps,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and as you go longer,
the longer you go, the more Terps,
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the TerpLock.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, again, kind of, I was taught,
grew up with hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was taught the old way, you know,
and some might consider them wives tales,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was not factual information
around this because this plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressed for a century, you know,
is weaponized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew what we knew and that's what
always worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, again, the old guys taught you,
Hey, this is how I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you smoke it and it's fire,
or at least fired us at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, okay, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran mason jars and kept them sterile,
did all the right process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little uncertain about the
TerpLock technology because I thought all
[SPEAKER_00]: bags were created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we grew up with, you know,
Ziploc bags or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: baggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I slang and I sell them in baggies,
you know, but that was based out in a set
[SPEAKER_00]: or film canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do the little stash cans,
but I was kind of a little skeptical on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they explain the technology,
because I'm one of the, and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: probably figured this out with me,
being that I'm community first,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I have to believe in the brand and
the product that I'm representing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to make sure that the culture
and the core values of that company are
[SPEAKER_00]: represented as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've made a few missteps in my career
here, you know, with companies that were
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not necessarily in it for the same
reasons as me, but I also got to a place
[SPEAKER_00]: in my career where I'm like, I'm in a good
spot to where I can be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: decisive and I can choose if this is a
good match or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these guys, I did a side-by-side
test too, before I came to join them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took one crop and I split it and I did
jars on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did TerpLock on the other and did what
they said, you know, hey, go through your
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional dryware, 60, 60, 14,
you know, trim as you trim and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: some in here, put some in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was floored because never had I not
touched, as much as we hate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you have to babysit your buds when
you're curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, technically you guys say you
don't even need to burp it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that you guys say you don't
need to burp it, but I tend to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at my butt all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up burping it without even
thinking that I'm burping it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To explain on that why you don't,
because the polymers that we use,
[SPEAKER_00]: so again, and this isn't a throwaway bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time and time again, people are like,
and again, you deal with some people on
[SPEAKER_00]: the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, I like mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like glass because it's better for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, first off, the carbon
footprint for producing glass in that tin
[SPEAKER_00]: top is exponentially higher than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the carbon footprint for recycling
that material is exponentially higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: this because it's recyclable as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then think about the logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, even if it's a craft
grower, it's pulling down 500 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting that in jars and you're
shipping it all the way to San Diego or
[SPEAKER_00]: LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much weight is that compared to the
bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been on podcasts where this guy
busts out a Yeti and he's got all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you hear it coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear the rattling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pulls up and he's got the jars and
it's all, so I'm like, here's what I agree
[SPEAKER_00]: last season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it in a turkey bag tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its bags, I'm holding it with one hand
and I'm like, it's all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the technology is cool because what it
does is this plant's pretty radical in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that plants, when they're
living, you know, take in the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, put out the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when they're dying, they do the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, they release that oxygen to try
to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually pushes out the oxygen,
keeps that CO2 in that environment because
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps it down to a few percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it still allows the maturing of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on top of that, the fact that you've
got anti-microbial, anti-static and UV
[SPEAKER_00]: protectant and even our clear bags for
guys like you, cause same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have what we call our glassless,
which is kind of making fun, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like a mason jar, it's a bag,
but then you can see your buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't, you don't disrupt that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's cool that you figured out a
secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a test with a lab, third party
lab independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to give them the flower and we had
to give them the material to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we gave them the jars and we gave them
the bags down in Lompoc in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a long-term test, three month
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that while you get to where
you want to with cure in two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the optimal percentage for both
cannabinoids and terpenes is at two
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can keep it in longer,
it's not a detriment to the end product
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens after two months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what friends have been asking
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it just levels off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to peak further than that,
but it's going to sustain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you keep it the right temperature,
I mean, you're looking six months and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing is it's a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be aware of putting it in a
bag and getting it smashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those are, those are the things
like I love carrying around a tote with a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different flavors or whatever,
you know, and a backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to do that,
you need to put them in jars or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's the only thing is you can get
it smashed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do it like squints down in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll put in, again, that's a guy,
totally respect his craft, being a full
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his stuff, especially his Wendy is
super loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one where I got in a
regular bag and you know, bring it back
[SPEAKER_00]: home and my whole whole house smelled like
a skunk came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, okay, I got to put this in
another bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he puts them in the little trays,
which does help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to getting into man, this is,
I got to share this and I got to tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: story behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only told a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as segues, so I have to share
and you remember the phone call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was over at Ed Rosenthal's and we
were on our way up to a Hall of Flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and I stopped by with a few buddies and
you're, you're as good a buddies too with
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed and Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, they're just lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we brought some flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consume that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ed brings out a baggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean literally, I'm like,
Ed, you're giving me flashbacks of high
[SPEAKER_00]: school, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you doing with that bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where did you get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Oh, James gave me this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I opened it up and like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I knew you were a GenX ad,
but from a growing standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you grew that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really I was like, my God,
this stuff is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my second response was like,
what is it doing in a regular bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I called you and I'm like,
dude, smoking your stuff right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed gave it to me, but he gave it to me in
a fricking sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, we got to come up with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's the first time that you see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really awesome, but that's exactly
what he came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely embodies everything that
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that seventies vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love your seventies vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was a big time for,
you know, for the community, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely want to play on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we came together with the collab
bags, do with them as you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the one thing I wanted to come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ever go back to Ed's and he has your
flower, I didn't want, I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it in a sandwich bag, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny how much like polyethylene bags
and sandwich bags, it's just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they kill the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of, you know, they have
them sitting around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is like, man,
unless they're in the freezer in those
[SPEAKER_01]: bags, you're killing turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're losing turps every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are, you are man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a hydrocarbon people and not to
get geeky, but that's exactly it,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turpenes in their, in their volatile
hydrocarbons and you get them even 70
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and higher, and they start
dissipating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people like, God,
this smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: People keep an opening the bag and it's
like, you're losing a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem is it's genie in a
bottle scenario, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you let it out, it's not like I can
put all that goodness back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to contain it and maintain
it is a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even a study, a guy who's doing large
scale pre-rolls up here, he had an R and D
[SPEAKER_00]: team that's doing a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found that there's up to a 50% of the
turp loss post-grind and they're grinding
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of pounds a shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh my God, how much
quality are we losing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to try to retain as much as
we can post-grind, but, but through the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll process.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're talking about grinding is
probably putting in a blender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, you know, I feel like a lot
of guys that do pre-rolls, they blend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like the pre-rolls, we've been
working on a pre-roll to launch in metric
[SPEAKER_01]: in California for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do it, we're going to do it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hand, hand ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's, you know, in milled,
we're going to use a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then those, the thing is, is with the
joints, you want to consume them fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not something you want to sit on a
shelf for two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even really want to sit on a
shelf for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could get a, you know, a pre-roll
should be rolled and smoked relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a cold storage will help
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, you know, doing cold storage
with these bags, they probably last a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you absolutely can still maintain
really high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fresh frozen bags for guys that
are, you know, on the concentrate side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but exactly your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can chill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can freeze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pointed out something a lot of
people are not really aware of or
[SPEAKER_00]: cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about grinding, but there's a
difference between grinding and milling
[SPEAKER_00]: and you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grinding is you're pulverizing that
material and what you're doing is yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're ripping apart the biomass,
but the most delicate part of this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is on the outside, not the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I explained to people who
are kind of the layman to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, oh, well, can't you just handle it
this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't you just process, isn't it the same
as mushrooms or tomatoes or any?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, because all those things,
the goodness is on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have a protective layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapples, oranges, every citrus fruit
has this protective layer, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: your gourds and, you know, a lot of your
other vegetables have protective layers
[SPEAKER_00]: as, cause I'm a gardener across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got citrus, I've got, you know,
all kinds of veggies and I've got my
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I explained to them, that's the
difference is it's all on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I explained to them, like,
have you ever seen a hop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, I've seen a hop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, hop's the only cousin to
cannabis, but something happened in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of this plant centuries ago to
where it expressed itself internally and
[SPEAKER_00]: externally, a hop, all the goodness is
protected inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the cannabis plant, with the
profile, everything's outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't handle it the same way we do
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, grinding, you're ripping
the trichomes off that biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really, like you said, pulverizing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just blending it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think you're, you're getting,
you're homologizing it, but you're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting an inconsistency because
you're getting clumps of those turps and
[SPEAKER_00]: of those oils and those flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're turning it into a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So milling it, you know, that mill it and
just have it work with itself in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: break it down to a better material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like not to do a plug, but the flour
mill, that's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flour mill is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour mill is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I use my old school grinders still
too, but I'm, it's delicate, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we grew up like, you remember the
Mendo mulcher, mulcher in the Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: shredder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sweet leaf was the first one and I got
one of the first 10 prototypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet leaf is like close to my heart as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, you know, I love the flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I met the guys from flour mill a
while back and they hooked me up with some
[SPEAKER_01]: flour mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on a mission too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just like you, like, you know,
that's owner of a business that believes
[SPEAKER_00]: in his product, but he also cares about
the community and he cares about the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's out there and you run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw him at hall of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you see him on the circuit,
you see him working the shows and
[SPEAKER_00]: representing and it's about being a part
of the community, which is a bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, he believes in his product and
he should.
[SPEAKER_00]: His product is a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely should.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe in it because I did it at a
scale back when I was working for Flour
[SPEAKER_00]: mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on point being a marketing guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: The packaging is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the fact that you can go with
different size grinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want a coarse grind,
you can go coarse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a fine grind, you can kind of
go fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you roll up, like I'm again,
old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like more of the fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do like still snapping and
ripping bongs, like you go for the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people don't understand like even
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bigger the joint, the more coarse
you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the air to be able to travel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's too tight, you're not
going to get too tight and the grind is
[SPEAKER_01]: too fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be able to get a good
hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to go coarse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get all those air pockets in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it travels down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smoke travels down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I smoked a 24 gram joint
over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my producer of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you were in a deadhead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead in Company was pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the final is the final three tour
dates in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for it to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, again, for people who don't
understand, like this is ground zero for
[SPEAKER_00]: that group and for that movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the whole band, everything around the
band started here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the music started here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry's house was here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew up pretty much everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody grew up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely some histories.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hit you up and is asking you if
you're coming up on the hill and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, no, I'm like, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ran into a few other people
saying things that they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, my buddy is going to come up and
he's in San Francisco for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's legend, especially again,
when you recognize how much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: influence it had on the community and the
culture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and like the only requirement to
being a deadhead is that you have good
[SPEAKER_01]: taste in music.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's like you can be an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a good person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you have good taste in music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's usually good vibes though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is good vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the ladies that was in our
little group, cause we were 20 feet back
[SPEAKER_01]: from the stage, maybe less, maybe like 15
feet back from the stage, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, one of the ladies pointed out
that the problems are caused by the people
[SPEAKER_01]: with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look around the ones with the
beer cans in their hand or the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are pushing and shoving, it's not the ones
on psychedelics or the ones smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually the ones with the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely truth to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, uh, alcohol kind of numbs
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other things kind of, uh, you know,
heighten your senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really, for those kinds of shows,
you want to be hypersensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, yeah, they, they provide this
hypersensitive experience for you if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hypersensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, why we get along so
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I tell people, and I kind of just
put it as a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I quit drinking back in 2019 and I was
never really a big drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I like the plant because of the
holistic attributes to it and being a
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer survivor too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about, okay, I need to,
I need to put good things in my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never want to come out of remission,
but I just got bored of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is interesting because to your
point, I was like, man, alcohol makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you're running like cannabis not
only helps me remember, but helps me
[SPEAKER_00]: discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again, this against the
stereotype, you know, when I call out,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I can be a little bit of a touch of
activists when I do give my opinion on the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall stereotype and stigmas and taboos
associated with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't just blame Anslinger back in
the thirties or Nixon in the seventies or
[SPEAKER_00]: Daryl Gates and Nancy Reagan with the DARE
program in our era in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also blame Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, so they've got characters
like Spicoli and guys trying to go find
[SPEAKER_00]: White Castle and all this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's not, I, maybe a little
bit of short-term because I'm so
[SPEAKER_00]: enthralled in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I educate people and help them
understand, it reclocks your brain so that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from an experiential,
I mean, everything, music, food,
[SPEAKER_00]: sex, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is inherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enhanced because it puts more of an
annunciation on that experiential,
[SPEAKER_00]: but alcohol numbs you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and then there's guys like
Sanjay Gupta, who kind of brought it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the light on 60 minutes ago that made my
parents aware of the benefits of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and THC and CBD and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Elon Musk, who he smokes
on the Joe Rogan podcast and he's the
[SPEAKER_00]: wealthiest person in the world.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sanjay, that's a good one,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was going against the grain with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he corrected himself and it
takes, it takes a big person to say I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong or I misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the big thing is, is how can you argue
with a parent that wants to help their kid
[SPEAKER_01]: get better, their kid's sick, you know,
and it's like, how are we to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my biggest argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, if it makes you better and
you're not hurting anybody, how can you
[SPEAKER_01]: say that's wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what really, I don't talk
about too much, but when I say Wade,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because again, while it was such
an influence when I was younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did go down the mainstream career path.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got pulled back in,
in a good way in Denver, when it legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: moved out there in 2014 and, you know,
eventually became GM of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing I got to his pivotal point,
because I kind of pulled the Jerry Maguire
[SPEAKER_00]: cause that company is owned by hedge fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it didn't, the beliefs weren't
aligned, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The culture and core values weren't
aligned with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had friends that were from,
from digitalmedia.com marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still put the parent company under
the name and people don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, first off, at this point,
because I do have such a level of respect
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant, I wouldn't work for anyone
who holds that against me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at, let's just look at it from a
business perspective, the fastest growing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the world and the greatest
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's a business person that goes,
no, you worked in weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't work for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But second, what you touched on the kids,
the children, it's interesting because we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually were awarded, we did a great
story on all these families that were
[SPEAKER_00]: moving their children up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dealing with grandma seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is back in like the early,
like the Stanley Brothers, Charlotte's Web
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were covering this and it really
hit home for me because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, while you study in school with
juvenile law and everything and children's
[SPEAKER_00]: rights and all that, in your point,
these parents were being chastised,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're moving from places like Texas
and Mississippi and Alabama to bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: kids to a place because Western medicine
failed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the side effects of Western medicine
was detrimental to every aspect of that
[SPEAKER_00]: individual's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up and they're going from 95
seizures to five seizures a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you argue with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, that's again, I told,
we were talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I came out of the proverbial
green closet and I'm like, I don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: what people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, quite honestly, I'm at an
age, I really shouldn't give a shit
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, you know, because what I believe
in is what matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying I'm always right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying word is born.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, but when you find out facts like
that and you see how much it improves
[SPEAKER_00]: life, and then you find out that the
biggest studies from both the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: and medical standpoint are happening in
Tel Aviv, Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell people like, that is the
epicenter of study on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Israel, I thought they
were conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, they're open-minded because
they know not everything that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution comes in a Petri dish and is
manmade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like trust mother nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a lot more answers for us than,
than people realize, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely, I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what encouraged me to just stay
and feel like you still enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, I'm going on a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine doing anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been to a lot of cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many events have you been to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hit my 190th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This past month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, granted it's been over a
decade, but a majority of those happen
[SPEAKER_00]: when first with weed maps and to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really happened like in the last six
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that I found in actually
wrote a series on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know for MG magazine,
I wrote a multi-part series on the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis by country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided, and I know again,
I've been kind of pushing more on that
[SPEAKER_00]: than other people in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of people, they kind of start
local and go global.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to take a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to support it from a global level
and bring it back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking into different
countries and where they were in my
[SPEAKER_00]: travels were taking me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, thanks to weed maps, I went on a
tour and brought the product to Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went over to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more recently, Thailand,
like we talked about South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica, all these places I've been to,
thanks to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because I found that,
you know, there's universal languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those things is food.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us need food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all music is very universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Words are not lyrics or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beat is, is part of that heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's kind of like that,
that theme song to our life to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is another, it doesn't matter if
I spoke the language or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was greeted by happy smiles in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are all just vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are vibrations, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in the earth is shifting and
it's, it's moving into a, a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: vibration, but everything has energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it comes back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I'm so thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the, the ones that really
stand out is like Nimbin Mardi Gras down
[SPEAKER_00]: in Nimbin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for the 25th anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember again earlier for us,
but we know this happened after the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: love here, the hippies were kind of pushed
out because the yuppies were coming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties and hippies were into granola and
patchouli oil and all that crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were pushed out to Scott's Valley
or the local state in Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot went up to Mendocino and
Humboldt and up the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the same thing in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those hippies moved out of Sydney
and Brisbane and moved down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: countryside on the border of New South
Wales and Queensland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started having this protestable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went down there and it was so
experiential and it was so similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like the hairstyles, the drum
circles, the, the bong tossing
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions, like all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's like being back in Northern
California, but with a different accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything else was like the whole,
the way they respected the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the good vibes, they support each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty radical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spandibus, like we talked about,
I've been encouraging people for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the most people from,
from our side of the pond ever last,
[SPEAKER_00]: this last year out in Spandibus is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expo Weed, the circuit down in,
in Latam, the Expo Weed Chile,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in Santiago is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some great guys that come over
from Europe, but from, there's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: culture down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people don't really pay
attention in South America, but that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole other scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a few land rates that come
out of there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some history, Africa, Durban and,
and Johannesburg has a lot going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but several countries have been producing
for years over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a whole vibe, but I've been
enjoying it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, I tell people, there are
places that were never on my bucket list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the articles, if you get a chance,
man, Thailand, like, do you, do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the U S postal service has been one
of the biggest drug dealers in history,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, as far as traffic tracking,
but when our troops would go on leave
[SPEAKER_00]: serving Vietnam, they'd go over to the
shores of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they discovered Thai
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're using the U S postal service
to ship that back to their hippie friends
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the sixties here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the term bong, that's a Thai term
for how they consume cannabis is bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was brought over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned stuff like that in doing that
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it brings a whole other level
of respect of how this is very much a
[SPEAKER_00]: universal plant, but it's a universal
culture too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been loving it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, you're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what I love about you and your
good vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I'm just along for a
phenomenal ride and thankful to be a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like both of us kind of have the same
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great experience to have,
you know, so definitely good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the different cultures all
over and then Amsterdam at one point was
[SPEAKER_01]: the epicenter to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed half of the coffee shops to
close down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor who came in office, she's a nice
woman, but she's been in since 18 now,
[SPEAKER_00]: she's trying to push the red light
district out to the edge of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's trying to push the cannabis out to
edge of city.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be a legal resident to go
into the coffee shops because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: technically safe havens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal to produce and courier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not technically legal or gray area
until it crosses a threshold of the coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a system that did kind of get
abused, but you and I both know this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the real epicenter of cannabis in Europe
is Spain and really is Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's six, 700 social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a little more conservative than
it was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause 10 years ago you could go around
smoking joints on the street and you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: really do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't feel like it's that kind of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the catalogue government has been
trying to move it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you, man, it's proof of
concept because like being a member of
[SPEAKER_00]: like HQ, just as an example or dank of
England down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it proves that people that choose to
consume alcohol can cohabitate with people
[SPEAKER_00]: who choose to consume flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have an environment where you
can get drinks, you can get food,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can watch footy on the TV,
you can play snooker, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone gets along and everyone's
good vibes, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, we're, we're having this
big debate about social clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: domestically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, go to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go experience it in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go experience it and see that you can
bring all these people together to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can monetize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't smoke, go experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eye-opening, you know, and we're
talking about places that serve alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: that have cannabis, a lot of hash and
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have food or coffee or
drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not trying to hustle you
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the coffee shops is come in,
get your spliff and your espresso and be
[SPEAKER_00]: done in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the mentality of the social
club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a co-op environment where you
come to hang with friends and you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: watching soccer for three or four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not trying to rush you out
because you're invested in, in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that environment, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's definitely, like I said,
it's, it's been a great experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: something that again, both of us,
I think have fully enjoyed and enthralled
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, as far as genetics go,
what, what, what do you, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: you said forbidden fruit a little bit,
but, but as far as like, you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular land race that you
prefer growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, where does that link is land race
encompasses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been nowhere to your level,
nowhere to someone like Judry's level,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I've been collecting through
my travels and so I'm very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have some pure Durban from South
Africa, thanks to a good friend to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some tie from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about Durban real quick because
it's been a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that the Durban in the United
States is not the same Durban that we
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced that they came from Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's the super silver Hayes
cross that a greenhouse and sense he had
[SPEAKER_01]: and some other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Simon from Sirius, they had a
Durban poison and, but I believe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossed with a Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Hayes is very dominant and
leans towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real true Durban is definitely more
musky in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sandalwood, musk, cherry, you get that
licorice kind of muskiness.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really earthy cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't pop the seeds that I got from
over there, but I gave them to a good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, Johnny Ray from raise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about an hour East of Garberville,
phenomenal closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has sheep on the hill, warm carcass,
everything's all huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a hip neck through and through one of
the smartest guys I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave my seeds to him, not all of
them, but gave a good amount of seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full term outdoor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got nature to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a picture and he showed me the
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is another thing you know
when it's more pure and not crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're right, a lot of the land race
came through Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you get a land race from South
Africa that's traveling through Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you get something from Asia or you get
something from the Middle East that's
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling through Europe, to your point,
they try to hardier, they try to morph it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the same because the true
Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it doesn't, you know by butt strike,
really quick tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so Northern nights, which I was just
doing there, they had their 10 year
[SPEAKER_00]: anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they wanted to do a cultivar with
Northern lights, which to answer your
[SPEAKER_00]: question, that is one of my favorite is
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like cause I grew up with it and he
sends me video.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had three different farms including his
own grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me a video of it and I'm like,
yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I didn't have to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a Northern lights dominance
crossed with a GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very specific look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when you know how it's
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again, I think why I lean
towards outdoor because of manipulation
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurs indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the bud structure doesn't always
express correctly in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I let it go outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to John, he showed me a
picture he already grows trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he had a 12 foot ladder standing next
to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was 14 foot tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, and I'll show you the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I knew that it wasn't
something crossed with a dwarf or a real
[SPEAKER_00]: large or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's too many people across based
on what's convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is something that won't,
you know, contaminate the rest of my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that won't get me in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stay stunted or dwarfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a sueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another, I'm a huge fan of sueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 50 50 pretty much of sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue dream too, that we were growing
along with AK 47 when we were still
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing packs back in the late nineties,
early two thousands, nobody likes to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a squatty, not easy to grow
high maintenance plant, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiential is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so going back to, yeah, I really,
I do genuinely like the land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sincerely hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find a guy over in Europe that
supposedly has a true Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, I'm okay with,
you know, I'm going to get some seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from, cause I think Andrea actually,
if I understand, he got those from Nat up
[SPEAKER_00]: at HSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's a, it's a Northern lights
crossed with GMO crossed with something
[SPEAKER_00]: else, but that does entice me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if you're looking for a cut of some
real Northern lights, I got your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause seriously, I've been looking in the
only place Erwin keeps directing me back
[SPEAKER_00]: to, he's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't had the chance to meet them
in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, my buddy Gordon, my buddy Gordon
has done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from grass Valley, but he's done a
lot of work with Northern lights and sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, he's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a huge collection of stuff and
yeah, it's definitely accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that is a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just something again for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we know it's subjective or
endocannabinoid systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just always been the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what works for one person isn't
necessarily going to work for the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, some person might like this profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like food and it is and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you like purple grapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like green grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you like the sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the sour, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got some crazy grapes coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do those cotton candy grapes are
pretty, pretty dope, but which is fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, as long as it's
natural, I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not about the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, a lot of that stuff we'd heard
GMO, but like the truth is like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff is actually just data-driven
breeding and actually experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but, but done on a different level
than I think a lot of people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis, but that's, that's
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's slowly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, data-driven breeding is definitely
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of guys that I know that are
doing breeding at scale or actually using
[SPEAKER_01]: data, you know, it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of need to now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing auto flower breeding,
you should be doing using data as well.
Yeah.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we know how huge that is because
you, we've got a lot of similar friends
[SPEAKER_00]: across the pond and, you know,
of course they use because of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where it is dense population
that they're all about the autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like to your point,
a lot of them are going more towards
[SPEAKER_00]: science and versus the traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have to, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can do whatever, you know,
if you're doing small tents, that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but if you're planting an acre or
two acres or 20 acres, you want something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's consistent and you want to improve
that over generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if you're making seeds,
you might as well be making better seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, instead of just making seeds to
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you're either going one way or
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not going right in the middle
every time, unless it's stable,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see it with regs, the inconsistent
going back to when you're, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running just plain old seeds, you,
it's a crap shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know what I'm going to get good,
bad or ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then the thing is, is growing it
out multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you just grow from seed
outdoors, the next year you grow that same
[SPEAKER_01]: cut, it's probably going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So besides the environmental stuff,
it's genetically, you know, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: genetically more mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's, there's just sexual
maturity that goes on where if you grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple times, usually the third time,
the fourth time, sometimes you hit it
[SPEAKER_01]: right the first time, but it's those,
the third generation I feel like is more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a true expression of where you're going
to get down the road.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've done those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I ran last year is F1 and it was
little basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was surprised like in veg,
it was some of the fastest leaves I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just to stereotype, but to a
certain extent you do pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wow, this is way leaning
towards an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, even just clonal generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to taking a clone as opposed to growing
from seed, getting that clonal generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of those in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really know, cause the genetics
stabilize and then you get the same
[SPEAKER_01]: expression and then you put in tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole, what's your opinion on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of curious on how long to
keep moms around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have some friends of like nine,
10 rounds and I'm like, doesn't it get to
[SPEAKER_00]: a point to where, well, so there's,
there's a lot of debate on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like if your moms are healthy,
you can keep using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but yeah, from tissue culture,
we do two, two rounds of clones and then
[SPEAKER_01]: put new moms in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're worried about viral load.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're worried about, yeah, just,
just renewing the clones to keep them at
[SPEAKER_01]: the most optimal point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're, we're doing gen one from
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the gen zeros, which are the
tissue culture plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take the clones off of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the gen ones and we like those
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like they're the most
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they respond the most consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that there's anything wrong with gen
zeros.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little bit harder to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just one of those things,
but yeah, two rounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen people put their,
you know, we, we, I was talking about DJ
[SPEAKER_01]: short a while back, but putting them in
the ground every year, you let them veg
[SPEAKER_01]: out and then, you know, the, the
vibrations of the earth restored the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is truth to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get really rapid growth outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get really clean cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have tissue culture,
that's, that's an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we get, we need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to smoke something light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to smoke some, a contest entry
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the contest too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was following that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually wanted the entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your fourth place is like,
we actually submitted ours in Turplock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's super dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great seeing Turplock in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we're doing it from clone
next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do tissue culture clone for
the next contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it'll even, even the playing
field out a little bit more when you give
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, especially stuff that's not
super stable, you get stuff all across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of take it more to that formula one
type where it's a little more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point level playing field,
how it's expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is a, that is the way to
smoke extremely fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of people say that,
like, I guess that's how I smoke mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like above two grams,
you really start getting the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way they hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way they refire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice candy turps in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've smoked almost all of the entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long was from start?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be the interviewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of curious, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was falling as much as I could
during my travels, but two week period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't so quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 15 days, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 days and you're smoking every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that 15 day period, you're eliminating
stuff right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's stuff that just got
eliminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got down to 10 and then those
I would smoke one and then wait two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want to feel the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about the effect, but also about
the flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to kill your palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're smoking every day,
you got to drink a ton of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, and then what you're doing
is you're comparing one to the next,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, sometimes I'd fire both of
them up back and forth and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, well, I like the way this tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the way this, this doesn't burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm using rice paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a reverse roll with rice paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that gives you a little more
neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a raw paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like raw papers too, but as far as like
for the, for the no burn, I like the rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's, it's also subjective too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is that's again, it is,
but I think there's some things like to
[SPEAKER_00]: your point, if you did early elimination,
I'm, I'm willing to guess that those are
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that were kind of obvious in nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everyone great on efforts,
but they probably failed somewhere along
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So something just wasn't properly cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the contest was rushed to be a
hundred percent honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gave people seeds in December,
expected them to have flower from seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: June.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, and if you, if you waited a
little bit too long to pop those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having to harvest early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the main culprit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the province people had to
harvest a little early, even in some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that we've tested, you know,
we've popped some of the seed sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some that finishes super early.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not everything's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, with growing
conditions and environments, you just
[SPEAKER_01]: never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even people growing in closets,
if it's extra cold, it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you don't have your
environmental is dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we're going to be doing
another contest here in a couple of months
[SPEAKER_00]: should be super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love to sponsor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was stoked when you hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know, I know you're a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, I, I did the same thing
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the Pepsi challenge before I came on
and obviously drank the Kool-Aid through
[SPEAKER_00]: and through and been nothing but stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you reached out and said,
Hey, this is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I've made very
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love my CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me the freedom that I desire to
make it be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was very clear and adamant about how
I'm community first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, this is, and again,
you don't have to be from NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be brought up by hippies
to be culturally inclined or, or to
[SPEAKER_00]: respect the craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it is kind of instilled in you,
it's easier for you to know what the right
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions are in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so fortunate that again,
you know, he allows that, but that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do more of is supporting
the community because they need it more so
[SPEAKER_00]: than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like you talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went to the head, I went up to the
hill and I thought I'd see more growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and these guys aren't coming out and it's
tough times right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is going micro macro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to you earlier about how you
can easily compare the Canadian market to
[SPEAKER_00]: the California market because both of them
came out guns ablaze and didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily do things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had the wrong guys that were pushing
all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the, the craft guys, the culture guys
are the ones that are coming up because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can stand through storms,
whereas others can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when the money pulls out
and everything eventually comes full
[SPEAKER_01]: circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like LPs and then even LPs coming
into California though, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: LPs in California in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a move, especially during
COVID man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of the LP, a lot of the
Canadian money was coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, even like wanna, I would have
never thought in a love, obviously what
[SPEAKER_00]: Nancy and the team at Joe Hodes,
like I go way back over there in
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing, but I was kind of surprised,
you know, like some of these companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then compared to places like Colorado
and Washington that legalized first,
[SPEAKER_01]: their market stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they've done a whole nother round
of consolidation though, over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, struggled during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had a good COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the ones that overexpanded really
had a rough time during the consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are still around are,
you know, it's improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, and as long as it isn't a
federal, we're going to talk at this
[SPEAKER_00]: level, but I did just do a show recently
in Oklahoma and it was not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going through a hard reset,
but then I also, you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: critical, but I'm still baffled,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in Colorado and it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's like, you got the business in
Colorado and you're from California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was a good experience to cut my
teeth in a market like that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought the experience, but also saw how
it was for a market that wasn't familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with legalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we legalized, a lot of people,
I mean, we legalized prop P, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: which San Francisco is a city and county,
but prop P was legalized in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think 96 for medical,
we technically have no medical since the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, since we were in high school
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going to a market like Colorado and
to your point, like I felt like they did
[SPEAKER_00]: it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to rework it and all the rest of
it, but then Washington, Oh, we'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: do it our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't agree with how they, Oh,
you don't need medical anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I totally am against how they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, one of my aunts, she's, she is medical
in Washington and she was a medical grower
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for herself and to tell her that
she can't grow anymore, that she has to go
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it from somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been pushing organics since the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she's one of the longest living
survivors of AIDS and HIV and did the walk
[SPEAKER_01]: here in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild, you know, and she's been
a cannabis consumer for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to tell her that she can't,
she can no longer grow legally,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, which I guess they allow,
it's a small amount of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like, they, they technically
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, I tell people like
Washington is one of those States where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, like not everyone's
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, Oregon limitless license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden guys on growing
hemp and pushing all that stuff to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the other coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was a whole crazy mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Oklahoma did the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, does nobody learn anything from
anyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: The government's like, let's just give her
one less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get as much money as possible and as
quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I tell people it's short-term
gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long-term goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was very selfish of the
government to say, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to play the extreme capitalism
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get rich along the way, but what
happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get rich quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of like, look, look at the long
term and invest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unfortunately a lot of people
are short-sighted and it happens in every
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people, they look at the
immediate and they're like, Ooh,
[SPEAKER_01]: look how much we can get for these
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just get all that money and then
we'll worry about it down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can adjust the laws or we can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you're getting some of
those people that are producing amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, like in California, that there's
this barrier for entry to get in the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a quarter million dollars for his
life, just to get legal from the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal grow or phenomenal product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has like, Lance, it cost me a
quarter million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone thinks they have that buried
in their backyard, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thinks that all the guys on the
Hill are still sitting on a million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in shoe boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but there's a ton of guys that it was
the barrier for entry and you either had
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty quality and you couldn't get in or
you had great quality, but you didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the money or the resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those guys are kind of, there's some
like, I still have friends to the girl,
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing flower that don't, they don't even
give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do other things, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the hobbyist grower and some
of those guys got the best flower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the ones who did come
out and now they're worried to go back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few of those guys, they're doing
organic produce and going back to farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: markets or GCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know a couple of guys and now
they're, I'm like, you're a general
[SPEAKER_00]: contractor, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know more about growing than I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know about everything in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you are a master, but they have to be
realistic and go, Hey, it's just not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so, but every market is it's,
but I was, I was sad, saddened for
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma because it was, it's really
hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really hurting out there,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the beauty of it is they can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can recognize the problems and then
have solutions to correct those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn from the wrongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you see the industry going in
the next five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, we have stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was going to happen at the
end of Trump's term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and some say that there's a
possibility during Biden's term,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still feel like federal legalization
is going to be a political pawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's going to be one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you have 85%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Pew data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, this is not, this is not
headset, BDS new frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a niche or industry specific
analytics or data company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pew did a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% of the populace of this country are
okay or pro cannabis at some either
[SPEAKER_00]: medical adult use or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that the, the old blue hairs
on the hill, you know, are still trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: play this political angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's another article I wrote,
like a lot of people like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the big three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that don't know,
we're not talking Ford, Chrysler,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chevy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about pharmaceutical alcohol
and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you guys, all those dudes have
been in this industry for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma has been in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, this is where the government
contradicts itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a schedule one, which didn't even
make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why stay at school?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you remember Sesame street where
kids both grew up on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, three of these kids are doing
their own, doing, doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these kids are doing their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw all the schedule one drugs and
then saw weed there as like, there's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be some sort of story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I started learning more
about the, the historical prohibition and
[SPEAKER_00]: weaponizing it towards minorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, it is crazy because this whole
federal thing, it's, it's overwhelming as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as how much support, but those big
guys are already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that one, so GW pharmaceuticals,
which got acquired by jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GW pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest
pharma schools in the world based out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the UK during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not conspiracy theorists,
just essentially in that jazz acquired GW
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical, which was the biggest
pharma out of Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're actually pushing their
organic, you know, plant based cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals in Asia, but they're the
ones who technically have the only one
[SPEAKER_00]: registered here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of five that use synthetic
cannabinoids, they have the FDA approval
[SPEAKER_00]: on a drug that uses organic or plant based
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where things are going to go,
pharmacy here, alcohol has already been
[SPEAKER_00]: invested for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco has already been invested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, big time invested for years,
both domestic and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just a domestic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that federal will come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it is sooner than later,
because just like our education system,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're falling behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're really falling behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg just legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw that this morning,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Luxembourg legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta, people might not hold relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few hundred thousand populous island off
the coast of Italy, but Malta legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're starting out private before
commercial, which I have a level of
[SPEAKER_00]: respect for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people are critical of DC,
but I give DC credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it should be, Hey, I grow great weed
and you're a medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me help you versus bringing in the
suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's roots over suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Malta took that approach to your
point Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's really, really rooting for
Czechia because they decriminalize the
[SPEAKER_00]: drug back in the seventies, but they are
actually waiting for Germany now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is frustrating because the Czech
Republic- The whole EU is kind of waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: for Germany to see what happens because
Germany is really going to set the pace
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since Brexit, Germany,
highest GDP, highest population,
[SPEAKER_00]: not huge, 80 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, I mean, we're 43,
45, whatever here in this state alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ever since post-Brexit, Germany really
has in Germany did take the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a great prime minister during
COVID and she really did say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: like EU, we can get through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I respect that Germany is like that,
but Germany also overthinks things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They over-regulate things and they
over-engineer things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a concern that Germany is taking
the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great with dogs and cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: With dogs and cars, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over-thinking, over-engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the German automobiles,
they're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not saying anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Chevy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they over-engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have German and Chevy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely think that Germany is
setting the pace and once Germany goes
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, it's going to be a lot easier for
the other countries to follow suit in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will definitely happen and everyone's
poaching it at the bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As over in England, I think I saw more
South Africans at one show than I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: have because a lot of the South Africans
were actually, they want to be the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: who, because it's a great growing climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so is Portugal, so is Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look at the latitude and the South
Africans have a lot of potential and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're itching at the bit to feed the
European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Columbia and so is Israel and so is
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in places like Germany, I think they
have a cap of 20,000 pounds a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's companies in California that
produce that per month or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane when you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the amount of consumption, everyone can
have their opinion on percentage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd venture to say a fifth of the
population of most countries, including
[SPEAKER_00]: over in Europe, are consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the demand is there and how they're
getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand grows too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it grows exponentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: With legalization, there's people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, they were big into edibles too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really kind of do the insane scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The edible scene is you go into shops and
they got every type of edible you could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff that I never even thought of,
they'd have there and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoa, I used to be a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like cotton candy with tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's another topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Incredibles and Juana.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites was Sweetgrass Kitchen
because everyone was doing short path.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing CO2 or BHO and Julie went
against the grain and she went can of
[SPEAKER_00]: butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she wasn't doing the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was doing the can of butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ran sueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: She actually ran sueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so impressed because I'm like,
it's not the easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the quickest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, when it comes to, if you want to
clean your house or if you want to lay on
[SPEAKER_01]: the couch, when edibles too, you can go
through different cultivars that lean
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy towards the indica cerebral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can go on that equatorial
kind of where it wakes you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropical equatorial varieties that lean
that way with edibles, especially if you
[SPEAKER_01]: do like a full spectrum edible,
those things can either kick your ass or
[SPEAKER_01]: do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all kinds of different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people think edible, edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, then you have to do something
like can of butter or you start using
[SPEAKER_01]: distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get those experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's just like the race to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes and most of the time,
the fastest isn't always the easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's a pain in the butt for
me to make can of butter versus oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done olive oil base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love the can of butter because I
know I'm going to capture as many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, not just cannabinoids that I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love more so when it comes to the two,
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so much better with butter and fatty
than it is with oil because it's oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: water versus fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start geeking out and going down
these paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's a constant education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're making the water soluble THC
now where you can mix it in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanotechnology was a total buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, 45 minutes to an hour,
no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stuff that I consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 15 minute onset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes away pretty fast, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the headache because they're
actually producing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a whole airspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do another podcast one of these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about the bags and maybe do
something for the contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe send all the people that put in
entries bags so they can return their
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I'd love what you guys
are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are definitely just, I think,
one of many opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really, really nice,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the skin, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skin I use, it's got the Apple box
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, did the soft touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the little Easter eggs and the gusset,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of went with the sublimation down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a 7 gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, if you're pushing indoor,
you can probably squeeze 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoor in larvae, 5 to 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has the turplock technology,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to do a seed release
with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a special seed release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're doing some distribution
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be kind of fun working with some
of these distributors and using this for
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, up-cycle it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take out the seeds and use it as your
stash bag when you're done growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have one for Skittles,
I'll put Skittles in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have one for GMO, I'll put GMO in
there the next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to keep it consistent with the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like storing everything in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Infinity GRs, they're all right,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with the Infinity
GRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely prefer, as far as for
long-term storage, the turplock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can people find you if they're
looking for turplock or if they're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for Lance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growbags.com, or obviously growbag
handles across all social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: For myself, I'm 805Lance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm pretty active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, I'm really active on
LinkedIn, pretty active on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's telling my story again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm advocate, not activist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lead with education, not a closed
fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely follow me,
engage with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love helping and mentoring people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people I brought into the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, well, I'm a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, hey, if you're passionate,
that's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, half of it's passion and
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Passionate and driven.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I have that work ethic, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not for the weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if people think they're just
getting in for fun and giggles and free
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be a rock star?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
