[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today our special guest is Julie from
Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today, Julie?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be with you, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to have you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about doing this for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we finally got to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being here like a year and a
half ago, two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time flies when you first had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Building a facility is no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand it takes twice as
much money and takes twice as long as you
[SPEAKER_01]: typically start out thinking it's going
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you want to do it right,
you're a long game person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so am I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you take your time, slow and
steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And develop it proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good things take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very happy for you, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking good in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life's an adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the journey, not the
destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the destination is death.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one gets out of here alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite teacher says it's all about
becoming the master dancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can dance with everything that life
throws at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of dances.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think enduring pain and appreciating the
struggle is part of the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I've gotten older, that's the one
thing I've learned is the struggle is
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a video about it, about how the
worthy opponent or the worthy tyrant or
[SPEAKER_00]: things that cross us or challenge us is
actually what brings out our greatest soul
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't run from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been feeling also that same
thing where you kind of lean into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pain and the challenge and the
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what's coming is the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say that the measure of the
challenge matches the measure of the gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your enemies make you stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think in that mentality,
you can be a victor in every situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never a victim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting older has its benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny because getting older
definitely has its benefits too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was younger, when I was 18,
I thought, the age I'm at right now is so
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I'm at that age, I'm like,
it's not that old, but I know we're the
[SPEAKER_01]: same age too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that cannabis keeps us
young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I say that the cannabis
industry ages you in dog years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely look a lot older than
when we first met.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think there's a sense of
youthfulness that comes from just being
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant and the kind of the purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the bullshit of the industry,
but the purity of that passion for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as you always do your hashtag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what keeps us young and vibrant and
connected and enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're blessed to be in an industry
that you can be extremely passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the more you put into it,
the more you get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever you do in life, if you're
passionate about it, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: good at it at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about perseverance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about not stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry is rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, you know, how the fuck,
you know, do you do this with the
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just say, don't stop
because no matter what happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't stop and you stay consistent,
you're going to hit your mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm definitely feeling that and
experiencing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you're your own constant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're your own center in the storm,
not circumstance, not people, not
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's also the kind of
deep medicine of the plant, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm finding that in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of very cool that the spiritual and
the business are merging into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I feel the Renaissance
that I always talk about is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be the subject for the
podcast was the Green Renaissance,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think you coined that term in a
large majority of the industry definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: can relate to the Green Renaissance
movement, especially the the people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that were here before
legalization, that even before,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Prop 215 in medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like that Green Renaissance movement,
which it is, you know, I think there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of us that can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the newer generation, maybe they
see it, but they aren't necessarily the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones who created it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can jump on board.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it's pretty profound,
James, because, you know, I became a
[SPEAKER_00]: certified herbalist 26 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I got keyed in to just
from my background with art and culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and studying global theologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I felt as a young woman that
Mother Earth was propagating consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: with her plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that the psychedelic movement
and the cannabis movement, the
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture movement in general over
the last century and a quarter was really
[SPEAKER_00]: about these kind of counterculture revels
through time that were pushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: envelope open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the commonality was, was working
with the plants and the plants opening up
[SPEAKER_00]: their consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found it really fascinating
that a lot of these people ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: visionaries who were creating new styles
of business, new styles of companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: how companies, you know, the idea of
conscious commerce or sacred commerce,
[SPEAKER_00]: that started emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just carrying through
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hippies and the yippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, 12 years ago,
when I came into Skunk and I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to really coin it,
I wanted to contrast that the green rush,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we were all dealing with it
and are still dealing with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll be dealing with it for the next
10, 20 years as Prohibition fully ends and
[SPEAKER_00]: we deal with the quagmire of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept feeling like we need to talk
about the Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to talk about what's actually
happening, that we're in the midst of a
[SPEAKER_00]: second Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then it was like, who's this
crazy bitch fucking talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: Renaissance?
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, oh my goodness, it's like
extremely relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody that I'm speaking to,
no matter where I go in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: is feeling it and seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been really profound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as big as the separation
between the right and the left,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like we were all blended
more so before 2020, and then COVID
[SPEAKER_01]: happened, and there was this big
separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that separation,
left and right, it's not the same as with
[SPEAKER_01]: the green Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is, and there is a separation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shakeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're seeing it more so because I
feel like everybody before 2018 was really
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that movement, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To build it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were pushing boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're seeing people that are in it
for the money or people that never saw
[SPEAKER_01]: that side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never saw the struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never saw people go into jail for 20
years or 40 years or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think moving forward, it's just
great to be able to remind the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: generation and the people that are getting
into the industry that have only been here
[SPEAKER_01]: for four years, that these are the
struggles that we had to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oral history of cannabis, that's why
we're doing this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Skunk Magazine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Skunk Magazine is an oral history of
cannabis, something that a hundred years
[SPEAKER_01]: from now we can look back on and go,
okay, Mila Jansen, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: she was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why she was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the crazy times, I feel like
there's so much stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: counterintuitive that people are like,
oh man, this, this, this, and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's quite fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being a part of, I've been in the
industry for 18 years and part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: global space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see all the different
marketplaces and all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: movements and unique countries,
unique states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Skunk, when I came in 12 years
ago, being a historian or telling stories
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the last 12 years, it's pretty
profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's suited to me because I like to
think of things in terms of decades and
[SPEAKER_00]: centuries of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly when you were talking about
the pandemic, it's a parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last Renaissance, 20 million died
in the black plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that caused the shakeup of church and
state and allowed people to start to find
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to gain wealth, gain land,
gain upward mobility in the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's similar and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I call it green is because
this Renaissance is really about people
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming earth connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, and connected to the plants,
understanding how sustainable,
[SPEAKER_00]: how powerful and self-sufficient we really
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we learn that we are stewards,
we're meant to practice husbandry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're meant to live in communion with the
earth and with the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been fascinating to kind of
hold that line for something so pure and
[SPEAKER_00]: so connected with the heart and what's
real and what's true amidst all the
[SPEAKER_00]: craziness of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also just stay connected with the
purity of the storytelling based upon
[SPEAKER_00]: merit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a pay to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't just buy their way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about merit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, Neela, for instance,
has greatly inspired me as a woman in
[SPEAKER_00]: business and as a woman just devoted to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like Benjamin Button.
[SPEAKER_01]: She keeps getting younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it just brings me great
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I took over creatively, I really got
to evolve the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the purest parts, but I started
representing men and women equally as
[SPEAKER_00]: educators, which can be challenging
because there aren't as many female
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders or female growers yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just all the people around,
you know, black, Latino, native,
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian, LGBTQ and a rich, a rich culture of
everybody speaking in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, skunk is in a homogenous voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about spotlighting thought
leaders and visionaries globally and
[SPEAKER_00]: having them all speak in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it's all happened because the
universe and the plants led me here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you listen to the plant, it speaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just listen with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in a really interesting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think they were talking about
like walking barefoot, being so hippie,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years ago, and now we've got guys like
Gary Brekka, who's talking about grounding
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not so hippie anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's proven studies that actually
grounding is good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it used to be such a hippie-dippie
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now a lot of things are going in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're having science backup stuff that
we once thought was just really strange
[SPEAKER_01]: and different and pretty amazing times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I really, if you truly are in a
Renaissance, and you know, I agree,
[SPEAKER_00]: James, it's been really gratifying because
when I was a young woman and studying
[SPEAKER_00]: herbology, I learned a lot of the kind of
things that were not really looked at from
[SPEAKER_00]: society, like sitting down and communing
with the plants, speaking to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my courses, we went out and we
looked at the genetic signature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and we sat with the plant and we let
the plant speak to us about what its
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of these things
that seems so strange, the Renaissance is
[SPEAKER_00]: really about, it's really fascinating to
see how so many people are coming out with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, science is now backing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even organics, what I've been really
pleased about is, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking about organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even before I got into cannabis 18 years
ago, I was fighting for organic textiles
[SPEAKER_00]: and farm-to-table and organic farming and
sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just fascinating to see and to
me, especially in the industry right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: back, you know, Skunk is the only cannabis
magazine, which many people don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the only cannabis magazine in the world
devoted to organics, which trips me out
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're the only one, but that's the
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back 15 years ago,
it was definitely fringe and it's still in
[SPEAKER_00]: the minority.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are still using salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've seen is that a lot of the
quickening that's happening over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: five years is a lot of people are
abandoning salts, not because they
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily care about Mother Earth or the
soils and the waterways, which we do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because they see the science,
because they see the yields, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: see the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what, you don't want to
make money?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a problem with making more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't give a fuck about Mother
Earth, but they want to make more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty crazy to see all of these
big time indoor growers abandoning their
[SPEAKER_00]: salt programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moving into the future and seeing that
it's actually giving them better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty gratifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a happy medium,
like the Synganic model where it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at the end of the day,
we want to give the plant what it deserves
[SPEAKER_01]: to represent the best version of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, you know, I believe in salts and
I believe in organic and I believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to smoke stuff, I like
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic flower just up a can of organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew some amazing, amazing stuff,
but I also have friends that grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa and use inputs that are also organic
that do really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a commercial scale, I think there's
a happy medium somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not going to, you know,
I'm, I'm about the future and how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving towards, and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, I'm realistic about
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I know we've gotten into this
conversation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job is to hold a standard of the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always said Skunk is a magazine of
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily just covering culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm creating culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a culture maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my responsibility is, is towards
mother earth and humanity, not just
[SPEAKER_00]: towards what works now or what's worked in
the past and what performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, James, we're like coming out
of 125 years of prohibition and what
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition did to farming and agriculture
in general and how we had to approach it
[SPEAKER_00]: and go indoors, which many people around
the world, they're going to have to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not, you know, to me, the epitome
is, yes, if you can have outdoor organic
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown flower, it's purest with mother
nature, but I'm also not a fanatic in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see, I guess, cleaner and more
sustainable growing practices across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board and just more consciousness that,
oh, what happens downstream from you
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it's like, we want to encourage
people of all different types of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, outdoor, light, greenhouse,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see if there's ways that we can
do things more sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it's a conversation and it's an
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I would guess that the
majority of people don't even know that
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason we're growing indoors is
because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so funny because without
prohibition, we may all just still be
[SPEAKER_01]: going outside or we wouldn't have gotten
here so quickly and we'd be behind
[SPEAKER_01]: technology-wise, but people started
growing to hide their plants, started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I like to go to the root
of things and think about that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: think about how I can respond to that
versus just talking about the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going to the root, yeah,
you see the origin of that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm fascinated with,
oh, well, if we were just doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: because it wasn't allowed, because we were
hiding, and then all the input,
[SPEAKER_00]: output, old system of salts came into
being from that, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to shame or denigrate the
past, but it's like, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we free ourselves up, can we continue
to evolve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we continue to do better in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I believe, James, we're at a
crossroads.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about the Renaissance,
it's like, I know that we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence and the technology to be
regenerative in practically every industry
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing that holds us back as a
society is not desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the corruption and greed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stymied a bit by the fact that
corporations are kind of ruling our
[SPEAKER_00]: governments and stymying, I think,
that forward progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, it's going to push to the
edge and push over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're seeing organic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the hippies in the 60s, it was very
fringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now every market you go into has an
organic section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the 80s and 90s for organics was
rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the 60s and 70s is where it
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gone back and forth with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I would say that most of my
friends eat organic or mostly organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just takes decades of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's some things happening
on the planet that are not going to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for my part, I'm devoted till the end
of my days to helping foster more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable, regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the term organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want everybody to know that organic
is kind of a bastardized term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard you use the term synganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked with different scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're going to continue to
evolve our understandings and our
[SPEAKER_00]: vernaculars, myself included.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Skunk wants to evolve with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think it's an evolution,
James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that anything is really set
in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just learning how to optimize
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And genetics, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning about genetics and where
they should be grown, especially when you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at outdoors and what's optimal for
what region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding breeding lines more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just scratching the surface of all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the big pharma companies,
they're a little bit ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a whole, we're sharing information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We share it in Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my breeding book.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's information out there for
people that are really looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the kind of stuff that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the beauty of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beauty of the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole dark side to the internet
and all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of the internet is sharing
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know where to go to get
reliable information, it can be an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often say that the shadow and light
work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's universal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very into hermetic principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of those principles is just that
those two polarities are always in union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they work together to birth new
realities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like the womb and the
masculine principle creates life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as gardeners and farmers, people know
you're working with the shadow and light
[SPEAKER_00]: to create a balance and to birth your
plants, your food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I like to think of that,
too, that we are in a land of shadow and
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of shadow that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amidst that, there's great,
amazing discoveries of just light and
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that is what always
excites me and keeps me going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is just keep pushing forward and keep
riding this evolution and help in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: you can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help the good that's being fostered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Spannabis this year was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the biggest turnout in a
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt really just pulsing with energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gone that I think that was my
15th one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandmother is from Spain, from
Catalan.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was southern France, northern Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she spoke Spanish, English,
French and Catalan when she was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever I go back, it's just like it's
breathing and the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I grew up eating tortilla,
espanola and pan de tomate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the different comida,
I was like a part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, just being there just feels
so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the conservative backlash
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is conservative backlash for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could feel it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they did raids the night before
the event just to flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was their flex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're in charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was, I don't know, 60,000 people
that were in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them went to the event even,
but people were everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People passionate from cannabis from all
over the world going there to hang out and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time and learn about stuff,
among other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke, learn about stuff, see what the
latest and greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like this collective energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just so bright this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post-COVID, it was kind of rough coming
back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's this new hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't feel it here in California
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are depressed about the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over there, everybody who went felt
the positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people were so excited about the
industry, so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like over in Europe,
there's this new turn of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany going legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal really pushing for, they're doing
production over there that's going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: international.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the energy is definitely different
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice and refreshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like bringing that back to
California, bringing that back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then it motivates people all over
again like there's hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, James, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what I've been feeling and what
I've been saying kind of over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: six, seven years is that in any one state
or country, you're going to be dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the quagmire of legalization,
which can be extremely depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're dealing with genocide of
farmers, genocide of small mom and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, any country or state, they all
have their own version of asinine laws and
[SPEAKER_00]: over taxation, over regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hopeful for Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: On paper, it looks kind of very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks better than a lot of what we've
seen out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've been telling people for a
long time is don't be entrenched if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get to the level where you can be a
global educator and have global projects
[SPEAKER_00]: and different global things happening,
that this is a wonderful way to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm constantly encouraging because I'm
a brand incubator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in service to brands rising to the
next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times I'll advise people in
any way you can, find a way to be a global
[SPEAKER_00]: educator, especially if you've given 20,
30 years to this industry and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, find a way to reach out,
even if you remain doing commerce in one
[SPEAKER_00]: state, one country, but find a way to
reach out and extend your voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like that's going to be the
thing that gives you lasting staying
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those brands that are able to do that
journey will, I believe, exist for a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long, you know, the next several decades
if they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's all about legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as you get older, it's like,
what do you want to leave to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, you know, which brings us to
the next subject that I had, which was the
[SPEAKER_01]: next generation, Sage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen Sage grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your son, Sage, I've seen him grow up in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, from being this cute little kid
to actually becoming a man who,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's doing extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's worked with Humboldt seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's kind of like seen it all
and he's finding himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to do a podcast with him
specifically, and a couple of the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guys kind of show where they are now,
because he has a long future in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and he is the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great seeing somebody like Sage
who is very passionate about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sees the business side of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Taurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's just very practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he grew out 181 plants this
last season by himself, yielded 71 pounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: moved them all at 600 a pound,
which was a huge accomplishment
[SPEAKER_00]: considering the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were dark moments where we
talked and it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just fucking continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you do, don't stop and stay with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a hard season too, because it
was a late start wet season and then had
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish early because it was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was particularly challenging
season as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was proud of him, but it wasn't
sunshine and rainbows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's seen, I've raised him
in a very, I think, old world way,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we connected on, but helping him to
do a lot of apprenticeship, helping him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled him out of conventional school,
even though he went to a charter school
[SPEAKER_00]: and he went to a constructivism school,
which was learned by doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I raised him when I was a
young mom, I was studying herbology and I
[SPEAKER_00]: raised him on the land and I taught him a
lot of survival skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, how to build fire,
how to build shelter, how to eat and
[SPEAKER_00]: forage wild edibles and how to make his
own medicine and heal himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught him those things as a young
person and taught him also a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: practical things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's missing a lot from our
world right now, but teaching our young
[SPEAKER_00]: people how to cook, how to balance their
budget, how to save money, how to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: and shop responsibly, how to have respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the basics too.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the basics that aren't taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, common sense isn't common,
unfortunately, but yeah, the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, those are the things,
you know, it's like learning how to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they spend like all day in school,
but they don't ever learn that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've really been a big believer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Renaissance definitely has
to happen within education because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: so much about how we have different styles
of learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people in cannabis,
frankly, are kinesthetic learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They learn by doing and they need
apprenticeships.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why growing plants is so beneficial
to younger people, whether you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes or whether you're growing
cannabis or whatever you're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you learn commitment, you learn
dedication and you learn that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about what that plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be successful, you have to
be regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to wake up and water
the plant when the plant needs water or
[SPEAKER_01]: give that plant whatever it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes your needs or wants have to
come second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I love about growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of the most amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these younger generation kids,
they all need to grow, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes in their backyard, grow some
peas, grow some herbs, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think get connected to the land again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about that a lot is getting that
connection back to the earth, to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's one of the
biggest problems is the disconnect with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I chose a charter school for
Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they had a whole gardening program
and they taught the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a course and they grew
their own food and they did their own
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped me so that when I,
when he came home, then he had
[SPEAKER_00]: understandings of things that I was ready
to teach him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely would encourage,
you know, all parents to take,
[SPEAKER_00]: take hold of that for your kids and for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it does bring so much joy when we do
spend time putting our hands in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is extremely healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool cause science is really
proving it that scientifically we can now
[SPEAKER_00]: prove that getting all of those microbes
and, and working with the microbiome is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually healing to our person and to our
own, our own health discipline aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's so rewarding to be able to
eat something that you grew, smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you consume it in one way
or another, but like seeing it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: very beginning to the end, where there's
no disconnect, where you saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had problems, you know,
you see the problems at the end too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I felt like, you know, I had this
conversation with Sage, but I felt like he
[SPEAKER_00]: grew so much in ways that you can't learn
from anybody else and you can't learn it
[SPEAKER_00]: from your parent just telling you,
you know, it really is about your ass
[SPEAKER_00]: being on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the frying pan and you've got to
fucking deliver for yourself, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, for your project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does develop you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does develop you greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was beautiful to watch,
uh, you know, and also give space,
[SPEAKER_00]: give space to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, it was an ass kicker and
it's just, it's incredible because now he
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what he can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you, you learn how strong you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn how capable you are by not
turning away and staying the course till
[SPEAKER_00]: the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing a job well done and finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Failing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Failing is a part of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the most looking back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Failure is one of the most important parts
of life because you can't be good at
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not God given talent that makes you
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's failing and getting back up and doing
it again and keeping, keeping on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just so important to
experience failure and experience loss and
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle and all those amazing things,
but especially failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay to try something and fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're older and you fail, you just got
to get back up and keep on getting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people give up and that's really
sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I went through a battle,
uh, last year that I'm not really talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about just yet, but I did find that again,
I mean, I was, I know this because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: read so many texts, sacred texts that talk
about the hero's journey or the heroine's
[SPEAKER_00]: journey and how, you know, being a little
bit obliterated is what actually makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: into the greatest expression of your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking actually with Nikki from
Nikki and Swami, um, and she's a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with her this morning and
was reminded of the Bhagavad Gita and how
[SPEAKER_00]: Shiva, um, talked to Hanuman and Ravana
and said that, you know, whoever wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: play the hero or the villain, the villain
will repeat many less lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always spoke to me that the villain
or the person that crosses you is sacred
[SPEAKER_00]: because it does make you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I'm stronger than I've
ever been and it doesn't matter what comes
[SPEAKER_00]: my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I can attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have the strongest sea legs jams
that I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from the obliteration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from really going to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people in the
industry are facing that through these
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of genocidal moments in
legalization and what we've had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through to try and exist in this industry
that's just so tumultuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say it not just for myself,
but for all of us that don't fear,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're saying, don't fear the
obliteration, don't fear the failure and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that what was within you that
made you create something beautiful is
[SPEAKER_00]: within you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing can take it away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No circumstance, no person, and that you
can create it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can take what's inside of you away
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's that strength now
that I have to know that that center is
[SPEAKER_00]: untouchable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's untouchable by circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter where I go, I'll do the work
that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's true for a lot of
people that have been able to withstand
[SPEAKER_00]: test after test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some days you just got to get up in
the morning and show up for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't worry about your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's being present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think presence is such a big thing,
too, because we can all live in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: and think of how great it could be or how
bad it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes we just got to focus on
right now and today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we make this day the best it
could be?
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Present moment, consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was in the health and wellness
industries and yoga industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a yoga studio and taught yoga to
kids and studied a lot of the sacred
[SPEAKER_00]: texts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my practice is present moment
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the present moment practice,
I do think it's very much a secret sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: in business as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while everybody's getting
distracted by what other people are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: or what's going to happen in the future,
or what happened in the past, if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the present, there's always opportunity in
the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always treasure in the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're present and you're
listening, you will get guidance on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: move through and where to go, who to talk
to, where to be, what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner guidance system has answers
every second of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when we cultivate
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really my devotion,
James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk is definitely teaching people to
grow fireweed with fire genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But underneath that, there's definitely
this feeling of seeding consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that more and more people can access
that for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's available to each individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's so powerful to know that
the guidance is always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of the Bjork song, her song All Is
Full of Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she speaks about how love is there for
us 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not picking up the phone,
if your doors are shut, if your windows
[SPEAKER_00]: are shut, if you're cutting yourself off,
then you're cutting yourself off from that
[SPEAKER_00]: which is available for you 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's available for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's exempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to, in my further work as I
continue to go, I'm definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: working on and I'm writing a couple books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to do more of that work as I
continue to stabilize Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those worlds of consciousness and
commerce and plant medicine merging
[SPEAKER_00]: together in union, not compartmentalized,
not separate, that they're in union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there's this wholeness that we
can all feel from, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no place to arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no end goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just present and we're on the
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing the next thing that we
need to do each step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to enjoy the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing experience once you can
look at it from that perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it makes the tough times seem
less tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found levity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very, I think, serious person and
very sincere in how I approach things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the universe is really always
encouraging us to, I think, find levity
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the key to the divine
comedy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just attend, you know,
attend with discipline and sincerity to
[SPEAKER_00]: our task.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, James, I do think, I mean,
and they talk about it, that I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from 40s into 50s, there is an
invitation if you've done your work and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done your inner work, no matter
what field you're in, no matter where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are, that there is a sense of peace that
can come from just being present.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think going into my 40s is
when I became a better storyteller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that with a lot of my friends
that are transitioning from their 40s to
[SPEAKER_01]: 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when you become a storyteller,
because you've experienced so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can tell stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there may be some genetic side to that
where it's by design so that we can tell
[SPEAKER_01]: the younger generation this is what you
need to do to be successful, or this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what you need to do to stay alive in
business and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My book, I would never wrote a book in my
20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought I would write a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then writing a textbook, it's pretty
wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys have a magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've written some articles over the last
10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to participate in the next
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put an excerpt in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think looking at nature,
I like nature to inform me in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you just said about nature,
I think of like the trees that die and
[SPEAKER_00]: they call them nurse trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned how they give and are giving
certain nutrients that are needed to each
[SPEAKER_00]: individual tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give themselves, yeah,
to nourish their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's when we feel joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the more we can, I forget who
had said it, if it was Joseph Campbell,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was the idea that if you align
yourself to nature is the goal through
[SPEAKER_00]: observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is the ancient art of
learning and study was through observation
[SPEAKER_00]: and through observing nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got the insight and the wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that is the Renaissance
too, is those of us that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: Renaissance people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a Renaissance man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Renaissance woman is that we're the
embodiments of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the listening to nature,
she's guiding us on how to do things more
[SPEAKER_00]: like her, more in a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think about that in business a lot,
that we are strengthening the myocelial
[SPEAKER_00]: network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm doing with kind of the
expansion that I'm doing and different
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue generating streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I'm doing that right now
is definitely attempting to model myself
[SPEAKER_00]: off of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we live in such an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just with technology,
we're in the infancy of some of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're long past that and other aspects of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine, we're just starting to scratch
the surface and we're going back to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're undoing Rockefeller's campaign of
ignorance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's profound to me because literally I
think on the first class of herb school,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was like 22, 23, they said
Rockefeller, he went after the apothecary
[SPEAKER_00]: and the apothecary and the apothecaryist,
his campaign was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He formed the American Medical Association
and he started pushing pills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started to go down and get herbs
and plants, say from South America,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they would create isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would isolate a constituent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would concentrate that constituent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people don't know,
but there's all the pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have those crazy warnings because all
of the natural plant buffers and the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant medicine was taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I learned about Rockefeller's harm
and then I learned also about the harm of
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates and how people became
disconnected from nature through that
[SPEAKER_00]: process, not knowing where things came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you went into the apothecary,
you could see the tea or the tincture and
[SPEAKER_00]: which plant it was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see a returning to that and I
see, again, it's exciting more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are going to get off of
pharmaceuticals or at least learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying, I'm not a fanatical
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying all pharmaceuticals are
bad or all allopathic medicine is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of the modern and the ancient
coming together in union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of times in modern
medicine, we're treating symptoms rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than going to the root of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with politics, that's with
medicine, that's with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so, I think a lot of times I go
to the counterintuitive side of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seems the opposite of what it
really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we just look at that
symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really we have to go much deeper to
the root of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throughout history, it's been like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're fighting issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been fighting issues forever
throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the undoing of the harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, this second
Renaissance is about going to the root of
[SPEAKER_00]: things and that we actually have the
technology like you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light side of this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always said like to fear the
Internet or to fear AI is to fear
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves in the sense that we are that
our brain is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking when you were talking
about kind of other perceptions or sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: perceptions that we have beyond our five
senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are able to communicate
nonverbally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always said that love is
akin to light because love travels at the
[SPEAKER_00]: speed of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I think of you, you feel it in a split
second and then you'll call me or say
[SPEAKER_00]: something or you know that I was thinking
of you because you'll think about me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all happening, but it's been so
pushed down because they didn't want us to
[SPEAKER_00]: be as capable as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's just part of us all kind of
coming to remembering and also taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma away from what we just naturally
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about vibrations and love
being a powerful vibration, but the only
[SPEAKER_01]: vibration that's more powerful than love
is authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny that that made a huge
impact on me because for me when I read
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was just a few like maybe it was a
couple months ago and it really spoke to
[SPEAKER_00]: something deep because in all these tests,
I think that what we're finding,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always believed that like cannabis,
you talk about Bob Marley and how he said
[SPEAKER_00]: the herb reveals you to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always told Sage when he started
imbibing, I'm like, listen, the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to reveal you to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she reveals, you have to do the
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to integrate the lessons that
she's showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just use her and then not do the
work because she's encouraging you on how
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, that's really
what's happening is that there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity that not only is she
encouraging us to be conscious,
[SPEAKER_00]: but deeper than that is this feeling of
self-love and unconditional love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've realized now as an older
woman that unconditional love of self is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the practice because when we get
into a space of unconditionally loving
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, first off, we can make it
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second off, we can actually be of
service to our community and be loving to
[SPEAKER_00]: our community in a way where we're not
expecting anything from anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need anything from anybody,
but we can just show up in our wholeness
[SPEAKER_00]: and be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the root of that is the unconditional
love and acceptance of self.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be authentic if you don't fully
love yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, I think a lot of
people deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of compassion,
myself included, of imposter syndrome or
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of not accepting the self or
judging or berating the self.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that also, as we get
seasoned and as we age, hopefully if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing our work, we come into a space where
we do accept ourselves completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do accept myself completely,
my strengths, my weaknesses, my failures,
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I accept myself completely, my strengths,
my successes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that unconditional loving,
I feel like I can really be relaxed and
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic and I'll actually do good for my
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to take a moment and we
are going to talk about my good friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave Mesford, who is struggling with
cancer right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We filmed the podcast episode,
but he gave me some special flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I want to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Blue 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just a great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love you, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his best bud, Vivian McPeak,
our managing editor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivian has been, you know, keeping me
posted and sharing with me everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been happening with Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, my heart goes out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's such a special fellow and I wish he
wasn't leaving us so soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a three year struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a three year uphill battle with
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's lived a lot longer than the doctor
said he would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sad, but I went to see him and he
gave me the last jar of his Blue 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Crow Organics is his brand and the
flower is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get a lot of, I get a lot of flower
from people all over and everybody thinks
[SPEAKER_01]: their stuff is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave didn't have to tell me this stuff
was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an amazing blue berry nose,
but the effect more than anything is what
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some pining in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to come as a, as a thank you
to Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dave is a great, great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helped start CannaCon, HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked with HempFest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a volunteer for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took the first photo of me when I was
in high times in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's also a breeder and a grower and
very passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's revolutionary in his own right and a
really good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's always excited to talk about
flower and cannabis and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds, breeding, storing pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect of the flower is really special
and the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor kind of matches the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strange thing to say, cause we're
talking about two different perceptions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the flavor is a mild, but turpy,
but it has this nice blueberry like that
[SPEAKER_01]: coats your mouth and just stays with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in my upper palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this sense of like pine,
like a pine forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's blueberry on the tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just one thing, but even the
effect is like, it's not a super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super long effect, but it's really
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's one of those things I
could smoke all day long and just be
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a brightening right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those ones that doesn't
get you tight behind the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Alison Drayson, she really likes
it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're going to get this strain
out there to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's do a strain report in the next
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing an homage to Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking with Vivian about it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he would be so happy to see his
herb come out in print.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took the photo on the back of the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the blue 13 male that's on the
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He contributed a whole bunch of photos and
he's just a great, great, all round,
[SPEAKER_01]: great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's celebrate him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He deserves to be celebrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love celebrating the conscious men in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all of us, our time will come to an
end at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people like Dave who are really
revolutionaries and have been advocates
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to record his story was an
amazing thing to be able to film a podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got three hours of footage and
I got some great stories and I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many people that I've known
in the last 30 years where I didn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: their stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad I had the opportunity to be
able to get that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, it brings healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious when I say that I really like
covering the conscious men in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: because it does bring healing to the whole
community to see men of integrity,
[SPEAKER_00]: men who kept their word, men who were
protectors, men who were servants to their
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful to celebrate them
because it's not only about them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about all of the young men and women
coming up, being nourished by that and our
[SPEAKER_00]: own community being nourished by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gift and I'm very happy that Vivian
has had time to slow down with him and be
[SPEAKER_00]: with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what a gift to exit in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandmother just passed and we were
able to be with her and surround her with
[SPEAKER_00]: love as she journeyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that that's so wonderful to
have a conscious transition that's
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by everyone you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody gets that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody gets that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, yeah, I mean, we live in an
amazing time with cannabis being where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's at, where we can openly talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's great to be able to get these
stories and be able to pass on stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next generation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Skunk Magazine is special in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that I think that makes
Skunk Magazine is really special is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very inclusive rather than exclusive for
its writers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get writers from all walks of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those guys that are watching or ladies
that are watching the show, if you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: want to write an article, you can submit
it to Skunk and they will consider
[SPEAKER_01]: publishing it if it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you get that with most
magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one of the beauties of
Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted it to have a community
feeling, a global community feeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are a global magazine and that
was really important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I took over creatively,
I set about to create a different type of
[SPEAKER_00]: program with writing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have like 80 to 100 contributors
globally and they're all told of deadlines
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all invited in and they can
submit content, which if it's worthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that issue, it could be published
online or it could be published in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's open-ended because dealing with
stoners, I learned quickly that if I just
[SPEAKER_00]: had the set people, I might be short a few
articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have this flow where we get more
content that we need and then we do that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where we either push it online or
push it to the next issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of people will say,
they can write and they can't write.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody thinks they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people can try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's good, definitely we'll
consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to encourage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon Rust has been writing some good
stuff for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's amazing in organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really well-spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a real good writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really well-rounded and really
passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very different because and I've
been, you know, people have not understood
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was doing, but now I think that
they are understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something about it where it's
not like the other rags where you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of buy your way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an advertorial article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honing in on thought leaders,
visionaries, and they're usually company
[SPEAKER_00]: owners or somebody on staff at the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tell the story of their
brand through education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that the future of marketing
is authenticity and open source DIY kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of intimate feeling that that's what
people are really responding to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old way of just pushing advertorial
content and that feeling of lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: substance or lack of soul or lack of
meaningfulness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of end consumers are
really not into and they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to it as they will with this type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I love about it is that it's
actually coming from the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the content is coming from the
people that are living it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're sharing their insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's actually something I mean,
I want every skunk is, is a collectible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an educational tome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just pushed the pages up to 160
pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: After printing my book, I understand what
that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't know means that
you're paying more money for your
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like buying a car every quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're 380 pages in the book and it's
just, it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it every quarter without fail and
it's intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is intense, but you know, after doing
it for 12 years, it's also easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I have to do and I get it done
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really excited because this year
is going to be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm launching seed sales with the
subscription, the Seed Savers Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the U S you're going to be able to
receive the subscription with the choice
[SPEAKER_00]: of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, the Seed Savers Club is all about
protection and preservation of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: histories and lineages and encouragement
of proper genetic work in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward, proper inbreeding,
proper strengthening and development of
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a lot more knowledge and respect
and consciousness coming forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I definitely want you to
participate after we, after this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to talk to you,
but it's going to be cool because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly talking with soul breeders,
people that are true stewards and practice
[SPEAKER_00]: true husbandry of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's about nerding out and
honestly enjoying nature together,
[SPEAKER_00]: developing interesting and unique
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, in this
Renaissance also, I've been told that
[SPEAKER_00]: those of us that are activated globally on
behalf of healing and empowerment are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to thrive in the bones of a dying
world and crumbling societal structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are actually bringing healing,
medicine, empowerment in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a pathway for you to thrive
because millions more people around the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet are going to need to access their
healing and access, you know, alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's why I say just keep going,
no matter what, keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to do with
these different programs of monetization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also, I just sold 30 pounds of
chocolate skunk into the California market
[SPEAKER_00]: with Sonoma Hill farms and they're going
to be doing 30 pounds of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, 30 pounds of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 pounds of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be doing 5X that for
this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a successful program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have another, you know, 15 licensing
deals on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another way that I'm going to be
protecting skunk is working with craft
[SPEAKER_00]: makers, you know, award-winning flour,
award-winning hash makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way that I'm going to
protect skunk and remain agile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also do something of substance where
I'm telling the story of what the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: maker is doing all the way from seed to
the final sale and showing the journey
[SPEAKER_00]: through the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty exciting to bring those
worlds together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been waiting to do that for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people think that books and
magazines are dying and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a nickel for everybody who has
said to me, print is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's just laughable to me
because, you know, I'm an alchemist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that I think of things magically and
have studied magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that I know about,
you know, the written word is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: written word will always have power.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the power of the word and there's
nothing that's ever going to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've evolved with the
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only do four issues a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do them with the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do quarterly and we have a rich
storytelling online, rich storytelling
[SPEAKER_00]: through social.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually bringing our forums
back this year as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right on the cusp of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will be back hopefully by the
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not about having all my eggs in any
one basket, but there's something about
[SPEAKER_00]: the power of print that will always
remain, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe also that, you know,
in the pandemic, a lot more people went
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, independent bookstores
started coming back and a lot more people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, changed forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain things that change in our
world where we're never going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old way of doing certain things like
the classic nine to five and the classic
[SPEAKER_00]: office job has kind of been turned upside
down on its head.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still exist, but a lot of people,
so many more people work from home or have
[SPEAKER_00]: flex schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, work four tens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was going on a little before,
but now it's definitely more extreme than
[SPEAKER_01]: it ever has been with people working from
home, people doing, you know, working
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple jobs where they have small work
schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about being dynamic more than
anything and being multifaceted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to print Skunk on Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to do that, but I will
always print Skunk.
Ouch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it sounds amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it would be... We're not
there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to be the first to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on it and, you know,
we're going to be launching also,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a new project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing something called
the Cannabis Guidebook, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a free magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be more for the end
consumer and more for the mainstream
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be, you know,
a mixture of like a Michelin book showing
[SPEAKER_00]: the best in show, along with like a little
bit of Rolling Stones and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I've been waiting to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a free magazine like seven years
ago, The Highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is going to be something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really anything out there
that's going to be quite like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a marketplace
component as well that's going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable to work with us for the small
mom and pop dispensaries for the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely inspired by Whole Earth
Catalog as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that counterculture
publication, it had very much a
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be bringing those
feelings back because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love counterculture rags through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've studied them and I really don't
know if you know Richard Jurgensen,
[SPEAKER_00]: who has the archive up in Willets,
but he has an amazing collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines through time over the last,
you know, 75 years, 80 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get inspired by things that have
been passed and then ways that we can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of bring those good ideas back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a modern way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about this and it's going
to be bilingual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's not to me like we still
need print.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that print won't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's evolving and I don't
think it's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I'll be a long standing person
in that regard, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's already existed for thousands of
years and it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's going to continue to
evolve, but we'll continue to evolve with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice,
usually ask about one piece of advice
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have one piece of advice for
the younger generation or Sage's
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, one piece of advice that you
could share with everybody about the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, about yourself, what would that
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, you know, basically the most
important thing is be your own constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be your own guiding force and seek the
answers within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look outside of yourself in the
sense of, you know, ever comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try as much as you can to cultivate that
presence with yourself in the moment and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen within and follow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow your own inner moonlight and let
that guide you, because that will protect
[SPEAKER_00]: you through anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just turn down the noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outside, as much as you can
certainly get inspired by those people
[SPEAKER_00]: that inspire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also seek them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, old school
apprenticeship, I've always told Sage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, learn from everybody that you
can and learn every aspect that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's been studying hash
making for several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's just been going through
chopping fresh frozen and that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what he settles on doing,
it's just wonderful when you show up for
[SPEAKER_00]: life and you're willing to learn and study
and grow and attend to a situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of young people,
you know, they need to understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time is how they're going to get the
best results and have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningfulness in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't expect something to happen so
quickly in one year or two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that it's when you devoted 10
years, 15 years that you start to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: results of your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and just continuing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's perseverance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say to a lot of people interested
in getting in, you know, keep your own,
[SPEAKER_00]: be your own constant and never stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep going no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always seek the way forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been great having you on here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you and Jeanette and I'm thrilled
at what you're developing, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kudos to you, to your show, to your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, love you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people are interested in finding
more about you and Skunk Magazine,
[SPEAKER_01]: where should they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: SkunkMagazine.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to Skunk Magazine.

banned on IG and Facebook.

Julie Chiarello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very easy to find as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just pay attention to what's
going to be coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're launching Skunk Genetics with the
Seed Savers Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're bringing five properly inbred Skunk
Crosses to market at the end of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's going to be very exciting
for people who have been looking for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, check out what we're going to be
doing in the year ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life's an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

Bye.
