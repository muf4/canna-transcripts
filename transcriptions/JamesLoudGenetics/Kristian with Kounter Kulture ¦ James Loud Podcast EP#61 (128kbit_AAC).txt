[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James loud podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and today our special guest is Christian
from counterculture and Conception,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great James good to be here, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you're here We've done this
before on the James loud show back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day and we've known each other for quite a
while We met through Jay before he passed
[SPEAKER_00]: over a finest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were doing big things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, it was just a fun time with him
incredible person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a valuable contribution to the
industry and just loved the plant loved
[SPEAKER_00]: weed he was yeah, he was amazing and it's
yeah, he would be In disbelief on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things in the industry and other
things he'd be excited about so yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you grew out some genetics of
mine back back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah back in the day Seven eight sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember grow on that for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had a lot of in the 215 we
had a lot of sour heads and not everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to wait for you know, 10 12 week
strain and Yeah, seven eight sour had the
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour smell it had the structure and
stuff and did really well with that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while You had that nose burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just don't you don't get stuff
like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey people don't Well, I think for a while
People didn't appreciate the sour and then
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden people just want a purple
I think weed is is starting to become like
[SPEAKER_01]: a fashion and starting to become cyclical
Yeah, you know and to see You know a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of old stuff kind of coming back,
you know, like a lot of the new generation
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether just you know smokers or people in
the industry haven't seen a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that we we you know grew in the past and
and got to like and it's fun for that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry being on the Genetic side
like seeing you know seeing some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's almost nostalgic some of these
smells that I haven't smelled for 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: and I saw it's like Unmistakable that it
has this in it, you know, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: real thing or it's a derivative of it You
know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about Urkel earlier
Smelling something with Urkel in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I love that where it's like you
smell you're like fuck That's got Urkel in
[SPEAKER_00]: it or it is Urkel, you know, I've seen
both Urkel Urkel's been going around again
[SPEAKER_00]: as well Yeah, that's one of those ones
that will never completely go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope yeah, I mean I think you know like
you hit the nail on the head that's
[SPEAKER_01]: nostalgic like for me like when I've smelt
some of these like, you know, you brought
[SPEAKER_01]: me a super super silver haze a couple
couple weeks ago and I was like You know
[SPEAKER_01]: like it kind of triggers a memory or
emotion, you know for me a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: and like it'll put me back into a place
and you know, it's special it's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing on the breathing side like with
the Urkel like I've smelled things I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, ooh, I want to try to pull that back
out deep, you know funk and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like purples nowadays like You look at the
color but like purples like how to smell
[SPEAKER_00]: to you know, right 12 very specific Yeah,
I mean before GDP was Urkel and it had
[SPEAKER_00]: that very floral What you think of purple
weed smelling like that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in there and yeah, it was it was a
good one Didn't yield the best now still
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't but yeah, I mean for as far as
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's amazing Say I like GDP to GDP is
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like grow GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I've complained about on this show many
times About how long it takes to veg but
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower smoking GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the taste I think it's great heavy
hitter heavy hitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that floral like Overtone almost
and then it's complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting how it's changed
over the years with genetics where there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a point where you couldn't even sell
purple to save your life and then it went
[SPEAKER_00]: green and you know, and then Cookies kind
of brought the purple back in the the
[SPEAKER_00]: color back into it and then it evolved
with gelato again and then They said yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get rid of all the green stuff I
remember some of the first, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've talked about this in the
past but like some of the first breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: books I read yeah, like, you know,
that was a recessive trait wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually select and get that out of there,
you know, and it's funny to see because
[SPEAKER_01]: You know in the old days, I think the
purples, you know probably weren't as
[SPEAKER_01]: strong, you know, and you know nowadays
like we've you know, definitely the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution people have You know got
stronger and and you know frostier and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff Like that, but yeah, I mean when I
first started doing selections and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding like it was a recessive trait you
wanted to yank that out of there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's funny how it's so subjective and
flavor is so subjective and color is so
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective to the individual and it's it's
funny how there's actually weight put on
[SPEAKER_00]: the color of it when it's something that's
supposed to be You're looking for a flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and effect but you know people eat with
their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and whether it's food or whatever,
but it's interesting because My friend
[SPEAKER_00]: just passed recently and there's a couple
things I've been reflecting on his
[SPEAKER_00]: memorial service was last Saturday and his
son and daughter basically made me the
[SPEAKER_00]: steward of his seed collection and I was
going through the seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him ten years ago, you know,
so the the value of seeds are in their use
[SPEAKER_00]: and not in their possession and I'm sure
there's tons of people I've given seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a germanium and So many people
have given me seeds that I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: germanium and it's it's really a trip With
that but he was so heavily focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor Over the last month since he passed
on 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been You know reflecting on the
importance of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been focused on flavor heavily
focused on flavor as a chef I'm all like
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor flavor flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so effect has kind of gotten sidelined
a little bit I mean, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feel good when I take it and I
talk about the effect But I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be prioritized to a certain degree
this white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this popular now and if you Have a
chance to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing thing to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an amazing effect Even beyond the
fact that it's purple rosin and purple
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's cool But the effect is it's
feel good wheat at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel great You smoke it
you're like, wow, I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take on the world It's not gonna
have that narcotic effect that some people
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking for it's not gonna have that
crazy sativa effect But it has this
[SPEAKER_00]: calling almost but like makes me feel
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah enough on my rant What do you breed
for a lot of terpene?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the effect as well to like,
you know, I've always tried to To to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it as like something that I want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know I grew up in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I love gas I don't think that's ever
gonna come out of me, but I do love I love
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit You know the last couple rounds
I've been breeding for for hash I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple farms up in Nevada County and for
the last couple years I've been breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: for hash and selections for hash and you
know, like with the state of the Industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's tough for some of the smaller
mom-and-pops, you know Like I know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always the the back-and-forth of is it
indoor better is it outdoor better?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it but like I think there's a
whole community that has been growing some
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing stuff under you know light houses
and been doing a lot of selections for For
[SPEAKER_01]: for things like that to get into people's
hands and in the whole hash lines and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that So I feel like a lot of
the profiles have been you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's kind of playing in this one
little area Yeah, I've been trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that area You know like a lot of
the GMOs a lot of the papayas and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that like I want to Explore and try
to get some bigger yields hash yields and
[SPEAKER_01]: and just have some new, you know new
profiles So I've been kind of focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: that for the last couple years Not to say
that I'm not you know breeding for for
[SPEAKER_01]: flower as well, too But that's kind of
been you know, a little niche that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been trying to hit and you're doing your
selection in greenhouse For the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have an indoor right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of rely on you know,
some indoor partners Preferred gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: working with David for four years now He
does a lot of selections for me and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Like I always try to get it into
multiple people's hands to see if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: right or wrong And you know, like I think
you know our palette sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for me I lend towards the gas and
you know, not everyone wants the gas right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You know part of it is also Once I do
the selections we put in a tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and get it out to the masses So it's you
know, like I need multiple validations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also work closely with Ana from CAM,
you know She's running a lot of the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff is as well as some other smaller
indoor partners in Sacramento as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, I think the more data,
you know from the nursery side of things
[SPEAKER_01]: the more data I can get to the cultivators
and hand it over the more successful
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna be with with the plants with
the strains that we're putting out so data
[SPEAKER_01]: on when to harvest data on this plants
never fit in a box and You know with crop
[SPEAKER_01]: steering and stuff now Like I've seen some
strains that you know They like to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed a lot harder in veg and you know,
like they don't like to you see stacking
[SPEAKER_01]: as much so it's like You know the more
data I can get on the specific cultivar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I'm trying to kind of package
that and give that to cultivators so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they have a better You know head
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's the future is is more
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we're doing data driven breeding
work I think Before it was like we pop a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff and we do our selections
now a lot of us are taking notes and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of us are logging data and Trying to
capture as much of that as possible so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we get better results in the future
Yeah, and the more, you know your lines
[SPEAKER_00]: the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Background in computer science
data collections always been big for me
[SPEAKER_01]: even like the old 215 You know,
like I had things stored, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: encrypted and secured So, you know in case
the door ever got knocked down like I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't lose that stuff, you know,
so I think it's important now it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: important than ever like You know the the
cultivators really rely on the nurseries
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know Every nursery has hurt some
of the cultivators and it's when everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: goes to scale There's bumps and bruises,
you know, like there's been no book
[SPEAKER_01]: written to do this, you know So it's just
we're all learning and the more that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can you know, give the cultivators a head
start I think you know, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to focus on on the breeding
aspect of it in the data collection
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're working with conception too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are doing big things over there
Some world-class people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin had a good vision and me and him,
you know Kind of shared shared the the
[SPEAKER_01]: same idea the same vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring in a lot of breeders that you
know, everything on the menu is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: paid royalties to a breeder, which is
unique if the breeders are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting reimbursed for their work and and
you know, they're they're more driven for
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation and you know if they can focus
on what they do great and Getting money
[SPEAKER_01]: for that and keeping them in their lane
You know, there's gonna be more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation in this industry and hopefully
we get out of this this box of you know
[SPEAKER_01]: purple purple gas or candy I should say
and you know, like, you know, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: the markets, you know Like you look at the
other markets that have you know come and
[SPEAKER_01]: matured and you know It's more about
terpene profiles and effects and stuff So
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully the industry starts catching up
and well the spray turd boxes in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you that's It's comedy that
but people are buying it on sale
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately people are but people buy
vape carts to so I mean it is what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the breeding is gonna go
in other directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already seeing it I see a lot of
people talking about sativa, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about how sour and og
are making a comeback and they will they
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely will there's a lot of people
that want them and if it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour it'll be a sour cross or Og
cross there's a lot of good og crosses out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's even purple gas that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's heavy gas So it's just evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is exciting I'm always excited to
find new stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah rhubarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for some rhubarb Stuff like
that, you know, I mean that little
[SPEAKER_00]: nostalgic things that I think of when I
was a kid, you know, it's like Pancakes is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for it because it smells like
pancakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I saw a
chocolate tie Yeah, it really smelled like
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was on the on the stick and it
was wrapped up for me Like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up on brick, you know Mexican brick
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we started getting some of the DC
bud the Beasters we moved a lot of that I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the first time I saw purple weed
actually and I was looking at in a mason
[SPEAKER_01]: jar being like I don't know that Bud could
look like that, you know, and then seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate tie stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that was like mind-blowing to me
Yeah, no, so it never smelled anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like it right still having to this day
still still searching still searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm gonna come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like there's some interesting
chocolate crosses out there The chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: is there's that chocolate hash berry back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of chocolatey but I wasn't
Super chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and same thing with chocolate isn't
it has a hint of chocolate So but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did these things will reoccur the
genetic recombination will Provide those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics again at some point those unique
traits So you do seed production too and
[SPEAKER_00]: you make seeds you make a bunch of seeds
and crosses and yeah We just I did a
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dropped at spandibus this year what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpod took the original skittles more
like half focus line Cross that to a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding some amazing few knows out
of that Yeah, found a couple that are
[SPEAKER_01]: pressing at like over 5% with you know,
a skittle guava Kind of like a rotten
[SPEAKER_01]: skittle smell Yeah, doing seed production
released another line a red line with
[SPEAKER_01]: farming stone another hash line great line
like the GZ crossed up the papaya rainbow
[SPEAKER_01]: belts and Another whole line that I was
doing Skittles Hindu skittles papaya
[SPEAKER_01]: across the sides in these skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I haven't had a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like Bagging on strange
stuff because maybe it wasn't grown by the
[SPEAKER_00]: right person or maybe it is good And I
didn't get the right cut or even the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're in the same cross Yeah,
my experience with Hindu skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess excited it I was an idiot Spencer
and I bought two bags because he was like
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one get one free and it was Hindu
skittles I'm like dude, it's gotta be
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and It just wasn't skittly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that flour or arousal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've had a really more in arousal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It makes it makes candy funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like some raunchiness like they
did the Hindu skittles papaya was like
[SPEAKER_01]: rotten fruit Yeah, and I hit that to a
couple I had to to the fat so I had it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the sods I did to a couple different
things blueberry cinnamon, which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: calling blue Andes And it's given a lot of
depth of flavor Yeah, skittles crosses are
[SPEAKER_00]: tricky, you know, breeding with skittles
is cheeky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of Recessive traits
then if you breed stuff and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles you're looking for the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not as good It's a hard turpentine
pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that candy in there and then we had
some Skittles back crosses that leaned
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy on the CBG flow gardens just got
some COAs done class It was like some
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous amount of CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to try some of that flower
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like yeah, I mean I like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like flavor and skittles is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've always you know, like in the
old days It was always like the nose sold
[SPEAKER_01]: the bag So, you know, I've been doing a
lot of selections based off of loud
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes profiles Some of the breeding
that's done now are the selections like
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like we've lost it becomes you know,
little mono turp or You know a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: is ruined weed Sorry for interrupting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Instagram is ruined weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that that mono turp and all those
things As far as why the flower isn't as
[SPEAKER_00]: good I think a lot of it is social media
because you don't actually have to smell
[SPEAKER_00]: it you don't actually have to taste it or
or Feel the effect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at it and a lot of people are
basing the quality on and you know Some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff looks amazing and it just
doesn't smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah No, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the marketing side comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I think that's where California kind
of went wrong, too I miss like opening a
[SPEAKER_01]: jar at a dispensary and smelling it right,
you know and now it's like I've seen a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people with the push tops and it you
know kind of pushes it to you but like the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed sits in that jar for For months,
I'm sure you lose that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some of the other someone just told
me that Oregon still does the deli,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like you still pop it open they
pull it out and Package it there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it should be I mean,
I think there's a freshness involved and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have the freshness of the product
It's like just like anything no one likes
[SPEAKER_00]: day old bread or something or stale bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I guess wonder bread stays fresher a
lot longer but I'm sure there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: preservatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's interesting these different
markets and then New York expanding and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their thing and I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own set of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out there two 420s ago and I grew
up there and you know, New York is Weed
[SPEAKER_01]: has been in the culture in New York for as
long as I've been alive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was excited You know, I was in
Washington Square Park with everybody and
[SPEAKER_01]: then seeing, you know Just everyone coming
together and stuff like that But you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the same problem that you know,
Los Angeles dealt with with the
[SPEAKER_01]: whack-a-mole's, you know, like they Take
out one, you know illegal dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: three more pop up So they're gonna have
their you know, they're gonna have some
[SPEAKER_01]: some growing pains I do think it's gonna
be one, you know, if you look at the sales
[SPEAKER_01]: volume I think it'll be you know,
one of the top for sales for the country
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, everyone everyone loves it
there We have some seeds that are over
[SPEAKER_01]: there now and they'll be doing some
marketing at the end of the summer flying
[SPEAKER_01]: out there looking at some Some strains we
have working with a group out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're planting like six or seven acres
between a couple different areas Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the one of the farms is right where
I grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably 15 20 minutes from where I
grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Wow, I'm excited to see it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just it's it's interesting and I
can't wait for interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's just I mean for What
you guys are doing in conception and for
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing and it's gonna be just
such a big game changer When it opens up
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, there's all these loopholes
now that you know, I think those loopholes
[SPEAKER_00]: will go away eventually But they need to
have it done so we can do it the right way
[SPEAKER_00]: where there will be interstate commerce
where cultivators will be so able to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: to other states Yeah, I mean that's just
silly that you can't go to New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy California weed legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to just like any other
agricultural product Or anything you buy
[SPEAKER_01]: in the grocery store the rescheduling is
not exactly what we want But I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a step in the right direction and
hopefully like, you know, we got to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing and Trying to make it better,
but I think it is, you know At least a
[SPEAKER_01]: step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had the chance to read the full
You know bylaws that were just passed this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they released it I saw Omar
Figueroa posted about it But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have the opportunity to
comment on it for the next few months
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that's gotta it's
gotta happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's gotta happen and schedule 3s
You know people are like me and we just
[SPEAKER_00]: get any step is a good step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel I Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think it should be descheduled a
hundred percent But at the same time we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to move forward You know,
and I think there's a there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people fighting for what what's right So
we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hope that it really Opens up,
you know like interstate commerce and I
[SPEAKER_01]: could think we have an oversupply issue
and in in California it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed and it's not wine doesn't get
better with age so no keep the supply
[SPEAKER_00]: coming turn it all into Roz and then you
get threes it I mean really extract is the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing to do when you have an
oversupply of product Unfortunately since
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't sell to other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but Oregon has the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce some ridiculous amount More
than they consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they were trying to push it down
below for a while trying to open up
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate commerce between you know a
couple other states and I think the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD the whole Farm bill has really pushed
the rescheduling or you know these whole
[SPEAKER_01]: talks because it's it's really cats out of
the bag and and they need to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to you know Control a little bit
better and and you know create a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more of a thriving economy off of it,
you know For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the new hottest latest greatest
thing in conception?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch as far as Like the candy
lovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lemon cherry sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a collaboration between Tiki madman
and Mario from Shubinski So it's the lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry gelato cross original sunset
sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the sunset sherbert It's one of
those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like didn't really get like its day
in the Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally didn't it was like You know,
like the sherbert came out kind of like at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time I guess that skittles came,
you know skittles kind of blew up for a
[SPEAKER_01]: second and it was like a real quick rush
into the gelatos and Gelatos took over and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean sherbert's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love I love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows it it produces Amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields pretty good the purple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's Yeah, it's a special one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely didn't get its fair fair
share, you know, it's fair day and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that whole thing very vividly
from the from the Bay Area and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: the sherbert was Just killer still is it
is it is so yeah, I'm excited for that
[SPEAKER_01]: one, you know I've been working with Mario
for four years now and I remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: original sunset sherbert I had got ten
years ago or something, but I grew it for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time and and Vended a lot across
California and then started working with
[SPEAKER_01]: him a couple years after that and then got
to grow the real one I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man, I've never never had the real one,
you know, like it's so loud and it's I
[SPEAKER_01]: like that funk that really has Yeah,
that's that's one of the new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a blueberry Thinment, so it was
honestly it was like two of the original
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that like I brought through tissue
culture the original thin mint I had
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten from a friend Early on it wasn't
even called cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't even called, you know came
to me as a cosmic or something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: and I remember growing it at that time I
was growing a lot of sours and oh geez and
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember growing it and like looking at
it Just being like freaking out being like
[SPEAKER_01]: this isn't gonna yield anything,
you know, and it was you know golf balls
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way up dry it fast forward
trimmers are trimming it come inside and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like, you know bags like this big
I was like, is this a quarter pound?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is half pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like now it's a full pound You know,
and I think the the Girl Scout was like
[SPEAKER_01]: such a game changer You know from what we
were growing that hit the market and
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was just like wow At that point I
was living in up in Lake Tahoe and
[SPEAKER_01]: Truckee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, like we were growing in
the garage and there's Before like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know AC systems and stuff like that I
used to drag cold air from from we'd run
[SPEAKER_01]: them lights at night drag it through the
Garage and suck it out the other end and
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean it would it would come out
black Yeah, and did you have like hoods
[SPEAKER_01]: that had airflow through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we started and six inches of the
fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Those are great hoods like I mean I
actually like looking back now I could
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled some really great numbers off of
those hoods even going through glass And
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like we had cool tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was yeah, we did vertical guy with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah cool tubes, you know,
I mean Interesting ways of doing back
[SPEAKER_00]: before we had real before many splits
right now many splits were such a game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer I remember we started putting
reams.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember who came up with the idea
But we're just like let's just stick a
[SPEAKER_01]: ream, you know, like home You know system
into the into the garage and started
[SPEAKER_01]: calling that way and that's when you know
you saw the big jump from from the lights
[SPEAKER_01]: that give you Just started showing up and
stuff like that and we're like can't cool
[SPEAKER_01]: this, you know, like we got to figure
something out So yeah reams came along and
[SPEAKER_01]: and got the rest of sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting these evolutions
and Feminine seeds I fought back on a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff like Feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like nah, you can't do Feminine
seeds It's gonna ruin the gene pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you know, and then auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very against auto flowers in the
beginning I was like there was some bad
[SPEAKER_00]: ones at the beginning dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some bad ones 10 years ago 15
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like I Saw them and I'm like I'm
never going on a flowers ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, then my buddy Nick Showed me a
greenhouse full of auto flowers and I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't believe that they're auto flowers
Yeah, like amazing and the blurples the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple LEDs like I Nobody they grew good
ever used those though and in my opinion I
[SPEAKER_00]: know at least the circle of friends that I
had like everybody they wanted to show me
[SPEAKER_00]: their blurples It was like dude terrible
weed and I like never I'm not using
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the time I was like,
oh that's LED I don't want to use LED like
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS or see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like CMH They should check her board
with same age too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a great way to do it
I think you get amazing flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's funny how like blue dream grows
better under HPS than CMH I feel like the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can handle the heat more too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that blue dream used to grow like crazy
Yeah, yeah, and I mean you have it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: now like so many people are still talking
about the single ended, you know bulbs
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, like the the double ender
for like The some of the connoisseurs,
[SPEAKER_01]: they they don't want to sell, you know,
they still think that that was the best
[SPEAKER_01]: You know best weed that they ever swapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I heard OG girls really get in her
CMH Like that's the one I grew makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the light intensity is not as not
as you know intense I guess PBFDs are
[SPEAKER_01]: probably lower in CMH is right probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's probably why it does better
Yeah, I always felt like I mean the OGs
[SPEAKER_01]: always just grew better outdoors for me I
couldn't I hadn't Jay was great at growing
[SPEAKER_01]: OGs and and inside I always I always like
to put the OGs outside I love good outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: and I forget for for periods of time and
then I get some good outdoor I like I love
[SPEAKER_00]: really good outdoor like yeah the effect
also the flavor and I feel like the rich
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor of a good outdoor like a good OG
that's been grown outdoors where it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: that gas that's just Down to the roach not
that indoor OG is bad at indoor OG is
[SPEAKER_00]: friggin amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like Brian vital,
you know His OGs fire that stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and I love I love that stuff but
good OG that's been grown outdoors Most
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor flower growing correctly is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's that 1% of stuff where
it's like, yeah that white thorn rose is
[SPEAKER_00]: another one It's like sun ground and the
the taste is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the nice it has like a floral ish
rose Like vanilla and almond is in there
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's it's complex and then the effect
just clean I think my favorite is the mix
[SPEAKER_01]: light the addition of some light,
you know, like Sunlight and an artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a handful of strains that
I've grown indoors outdoors and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: put it into a mix light and the expression
it gets is is just It's night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the future to honestly think
makes light is the future of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world You know as far as if you're
talking about the best bang for your buck
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want for quality I'm not that
outdoor is you know outdoors amazing too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as if you want an indoor
product I think eventually we're gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: away from These big facilities and really
focus on mix light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it has to you know,
especially in California Like the cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: producers is this astronomical the power
prices that we pay here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's too much There's some
growers as you know preferred gardens and
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucas from emerald kid like to mention
like their light supplemental is You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go up against anyone's Indoor,
you know, and then the only thing you get
[SPEAKER_01]: from the outdoors is like the shelf life
is a little shorter What do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's contributed from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the oxidation just breaks
down quicker Like I don't I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know was actually having this
conversation with David the other day Like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been able to put my finger on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hasn't either just like Yeah,
I don't know the Sun just breaks it down
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker or once it gets in a bag You have
a shorter shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting to figure out where
that comes from But yeah, I'm a big fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix light and they just greenhouse in
general and I think it's better for the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet I think it's as good if not better
a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the Sun in there sun kissed Sun
kiss get a lot of the sun kissed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then even in the winter you can
do mix light Yeah, so there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah under canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's like Little shout out to Favin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these guys craft farmer Favin these
guys doing under canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like the favins I've seen
really good results We're running here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's cool to see the new,
you know, like I said, I have a background
[SPEAKER_01]: in tech So to see the new innovations that
are happening, you know, like I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one of the good things,
you know, even with this rescheduling
[SPEAKER_01]: right like it's it's Schedule one the
government saying there's no medical
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a schedule three if it goes
out, you know goes that way like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying okay Well, there is some benefit
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the small steps but again now it's
gonna open up more money to really Start
[SPEAKER_01]: doing R&D R&D is expensive, you know,
like and that's where the evolution needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to go and it needs to get pushed a little
faster hopefully the 280e disappears and
[SPEAKER_01]: and bank, you know real real banking and
lending starts coming out of this and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just gonna push the Innovation,
you know quicker right and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: countries like Israel They're just so far
ahead of us with four years ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and studies but we have the
opportunity to change it any moment and so
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that part of it
definitely is a good thing The
[SPEAKER_00]: government's known it's been okay for all
this time and now they're finally like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay They've held the patent on you know
cannabis as a as a medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like since the 70s, right and at the same
time in schedule one so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like once I realized that it's just you
know, it's just it was always just a money
[SPEAKER_01]: grab and and You know them just trying to
control with lobbyists and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at the history and it's just It's
sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean strange world we live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is unfortunately, but hopefully
some of the you know, the old ways are
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to to die off and Even my
grandparents when I told them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I was getting into You know,
like it was it took a second for that
[SPEAKER_01]: until like that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps helps people but it's also it's
very addictive and I'm like No,
[SPEAKER_01]: like reefer madness like probably was one
of the best marketing campaigns of all
[SPEAKER_01]: time Like we're still trying to break
those chains, you know Like for sure we
[SPEAKER_01]: recently moved from Truckee down the grass
valley and like learning new new friends I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean we have a farm on our property and
it's just like, you know having new
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and having it like Disclose that
to you know kids parents and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that You know, most people have been open
but it's still like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people still look at you a little
different You know, and it's for sure 50
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 years of this bad information just beat
into people's heads You know, I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: in high school we used to we used to get
High and watch and watch refurbished like
[SPEAKER_01]: but people really thought that's what I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wash it on acid Watch it over and
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the comedy man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's funny how impactful that
was Yeah, and how many people still I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, there's a lot of people yeah over
50% of America's fine with it I believe I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the the last poll is like pushing 70
is like 65 60% I said the cats out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag And and you know, actually it took my
grandmother.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had rheumatoid arthritis and I would
send her CBD cream Yeah, and she was like
[SPEAKER_01]: why this is actually starting to work,
you know So I think the CBD the whole farm
[SPEAKER_01]: bill like really helped people realize
it's not the devil's lettuce It's not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna you know, people aren't gonna run
amok jumping out of buildings,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it you know, it helped and
you know push I think we're Where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going, you know a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny because like stuff like
you hear THC a and you think oh that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: gets you high and Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also if you don't heat it up,
it does not yeah I remember the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: I ate a gram of THC a I have ulcer of
colitis and so my good friend Tim over the
[SPEAKER_00]: can of organics made a bunch of THC a for
me and I had tried eating it For you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was a little nervous eating a gram
of it because I know eating a gram of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: like a thousand milligrams We gave me
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah But yeah, I did it doesn't get
you high at all, but it did have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on my gut health so
anti-inflammatory properties and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the things that we're gonna be
researching and you know Exponentially
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than we could before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm excited about that part of
schedule three Now how they tax it and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they do other things people are like,
they're not gonna tax it No, they're uncle
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam taxes that we have tax the shit out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you want to know who you're selling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Partner is his uncle Sam, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I mean we have to move
forward I think the biggest win here is is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know, they're now finally Saying
that's not the devil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not you know, there is some benefit
to it And you know, I think a lot of us
[SPEAKER_01]: got into this understanding the benefits
and wanting to you know I think one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with 64 is that like we used to
donate to this group of children in Nevada
[SPEAKER_01]: County in the 215 a lot of our trim and a
lot of those avenues like disappeared with
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 unfortunately, yeah, and We were making
some great strides and working with kids
[SPEAKER_01]: with epilepsy and all sorts of you know
Issues and I'm happy to see that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: come back now real doctors and real people
are getting involved and trying to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: some yeah, I mean during The two 15 days
it was like some of the doctors were a
[SPEAKER_00]: little You know little sister there were
dr. Liz Frank Lucito one of the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors I've ever known the you know,
and he was like really about it and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was doctors They were about the money
grab, you know a little the 99 plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's 125 for this script or it's 300
The one point they so some of the doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: were charging 500 for a 99 script.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Frank Lucito was great He's he just
retired last year, but he was writing
[SPEAKER_00]: scripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was one of the first ones So he also
wrote my buddy's younger brother when he
[SPEAKER_00]: was 14 script.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he had medical issues and But he was
a believer and believer in the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the benefits that the plant could give
us and I would love to get him on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I've heard you say for a long
time and it always stuck with me it was
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the sacred plant and like I said
R&D is expensive but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully we can keep pushing it and and
seeing what we can do I mean we like Lost
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 60 years to not really being able to
see what this plant can do So I'm excited,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for for the next yeah iteration
of the industry Yeah, I mean, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to be alive, you know we taking this
thing one day at a time and seeing where
[SPEAKER_00]: the future I try to live in the present as
much as possible and not get too excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about the future or too upset about the
past and We're in an amazing time on on
[SPEAKER_00]: some levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the strangest friggin weird place
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I never thought There'd be a time
where I didn't understand the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: generation Yeah, because I feel like
that's that's always like the case and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I just don't get some of the
kids these days and and you know I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like how my parents and my grandparents
thought about the work ethic of my
[SPEAKER_00]: Generation is kind of how I feel about the
work ethic of the younger generation It's
[SPEAKER_00]: like I feel like our generation has like
this work ethic and you know, not all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us There's a lot of dirty friends that I
started up with but a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_00]: have work ethic and then the younger
generation I think with technology It's
[SPEAKER_00]: made life easier Made people softer,
but like my father's generation and my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandfather's generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were way tougher than our
generation I feel like absolutely these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys were made of leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I You know My parents are both like
first generation My dad's side came from
[SPEAKER_01]: from Norway my my mom my mom side from off
the boat from Italy Yeah, you know and and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the things that I grew up watching
your stories I heard and and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Visibility like solid like my my
dad and my uncle had to like really dig
[SPEAKER_01]: out underneath the house to make a
basement have like a you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a den for everybody, you know,
like At like 10 12 years old, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just digging things like that and I grew
up in a construction family and and I get
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped off after kindergarten I get
dropped off to my dad's job site and have
[SPEAKER_01]: to run around pick up Pieces of wood and
clean up, you know at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: and now like we kind of Live on a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like my kids are all sudden have the
huge towards chore list to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know They're not happy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they weren't you know, they weren't
around that but now it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we we live on a big,
you know piece of property and Everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: has a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has a responsibilities Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another interesting place with
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I think Mexico Columbia
especially being you know around the
[SPEAKER_01]: equator Yeah, you know kind of like what
they did to you know, like the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and stuff like I've done a lot of
work in over the years and Monterey and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like watching that, you know get
moved to South America like it's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder how that's going to affect You know
cannabis going, you know, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding is great, you know, like being in
a 1212 and Not having to to you manipulate
[SPEAKER_01]: lights at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could think it could be a great area to
breathe But well, you're breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: different things down there like a
humidity and things that do well in that
[SPEAKER_00]: 1212 environment you could take something
that performs really well here and Bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it down there and it might not perform and
something that sucks up here and bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: down there and it might perform really
well Also, you could take something here
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think is gonna be a certain way
you bring it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely different So it's the
beautiful thing about a you know climate
[SPEAKER_00]: and localized genetics that work well for
those local environments I mean we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah bringing the race back to land I
guess again going back to innovation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know being You know two regulations
getting spurred right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're breeding for you know Not just
the effects of the terpenes but also
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for like traits we're looking
for, you know, like there's you know some
[SPEAKER_01]: that are you know, but try this resistant
or pest resistant like, you know again,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where I feel like we're gonna make
some leaps and bounds over the next couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of years if You know if the rescheduling
happens and well, and I think there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of traits that people don't even think
about You know when they're doing breed a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of readers aren't even thinking about
like does this plant trigger faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is those sort of traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be extremely beneficial in places that
have shorter seasons, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and not everything triggers at
the same point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know and it's And there but
there's so many traits like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I grew one this past year that
Outside like it won't trigger until it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets right at 12 12, you know,
yeah and Had it still was still up in in
[SPEAKER_01]: November, you know like getting to
Thanksgiving and but you put it and adapt
[SPEAKER_01]: and manipulate the light triggers triggers
And it finishes quicker, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love I love I love breeding I love
you know, the female hunting side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things I think you know, like that's often
overlooked, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all want to be a breeder,
but they all just want to make seeds They
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people love it Yeah, but a lot of
people think the breeding is making the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and that's like the the smallest
part of the whole breeding process Is this
[SPEAKER_00]: in it's the part that anybody can do it's
the seed selection and going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just hitting the lottery with
stuff And other times knowing your line
[SPEAKER_00]: really well and knowing that you need to
pop 20 seeds and you're gonna find Kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking for, you know,
we People argue about big hunts and little
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts and it's it's different for
everybody and what you're looking forward
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to find unicorns,
you know, and you're going through big
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're trying to find specific
things in smaller hunts, that's good,
[SPEAKER_00]: too How much of your resources you want to
dedicate to one specific cross or to tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of different crosses?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like now Now the the whole concept
of curation, you know is is being thrown
[SPEAKER_01]: around a lot but I think on the pheno hunt
side like knowing what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: is you know and being able to Pull pull
that right thing out like it sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole new trait or you know,
like that I think is overlooked a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a whole there's a whole art to it too
and also knowing your lines because the
[SPEAKER_00]: more you work with those lines the more
you know them and you know kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna pass on like depending on what
the parents are and You can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: identify stuff if you work with it a lot
But if you're working with completely new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff all the time It's harder to get a
grasp of really what's contributing what
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that's unfortunately where the
industry is right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everyone wants a new hottest
thing, you know, like but you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that I grew up around You know
breeding and stuff like they worked lines
[SPEAKER_01]: for years and years and years,
you know to get something and that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one of those arts that have kind of
been lost right now a lot of my stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked a lot I don't even offer
because people don't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stuff that we've been working for the
last four years since 2018 especially like
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't share a lot of the autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes But the photo period stuff not so much
because people just don't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want RS 11 times permanent marker
Yeah, or whatever it is the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest cross with the latest grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whatever your latest greatest cross
With everybody else's latest grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what people were super
hyper focused on But I think we are going
[SPEAKER_00]: back my banana coffee has been selling
like crazy which is the Fort Collins cough
[SPEAKER_00]: times banana Z that I made yeah,
and I Wouldn't say that it has a great bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that it finishes early It's
it's but it's special because that Fort
[SPEAKER_00]: Collins coffee is like the nl5 haze like
the PIF Cuban black haze Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many nl5 haze crosses that are
good and Fort Collins coffee is special
[SPEAKER_00]: and it spears out and it grows tall and
You know short it doesn't it doesn't bush
[SPEAKER_00]: out at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of shoots up Okay,
you get a little lot of not a little but a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of apical growth where it's just like
one main shoot and Then side branches that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all smaller, but it has this crazy
funky like nose-burning profile It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like your typical Sativa, which is what I
like which is kind of like PIF is like
[SPEAKER_00]: that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a typical Sativa and so you put
some candy On there and you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: some real funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like sometimes taking both ends of the
spectrum and putting them together You got
[SPEAKER_00]: to get like I was thinking that's better
So, you know, it's like one thing just
[SPEAKER_00]: putting all the gelato with another gelato
and that's it's fine Yeah, but going real
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme on stuff where it's like I'm gonna
take the shortest plant that grows the
[SPEAKER_00]: slowest and Then put it with the most
vigorous crazy plant that gets super tall
[SPEAKER_00]: that I need shorter And seeing what comes
off of that we're doing some wild fino
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting right now We have some stuff
that's completely like the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stuff that's six weeks old That's
like still only this but it's like bush
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like five feet tall the feminized
portion is is unique to you like
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding the lines and then all
sudden it's like an onion sometimes like
[SPEAKER_01]: all sudden you open you take another layer
off and you're like I didn't know that was
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, you know, like all sudden
something, you know, right field You're
[SPEAKER_01]: like where the hell did that come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's like the skills?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's once like you get a lot of stuff
that's most of it's not skittles not
[SPEAKER_00]: skittling not stuff that I and and there's
also terpenaline like limonene and
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenaline in the freaking progeny to
when you cross skills to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah first class genetics my buddy ray He
had some problems with his skittles and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was definitely Terpenaline dominant really
after yeah epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, which we can still argue whether
epigenetics exists or not, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely think I so my my first
experience with that was the ghosts og and
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh do g where they'd gone through two
different places and ground side-by-side
[SPEAKER_00]: they're similar, but they're totally
different and So those have taken two
[SPEAKER_00]: different paths, even though at one point
they were a clone off of the same plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh, and they're different do you think
that's like from style or for like I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say genetic drift because it's
Whatever epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those those plants experience
bacterial load and who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogens over the period of time and
maybe they fight off some and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: there's good bacteria that changes in the
plant You know, so there's these chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not just genetics But they can
be different expressions and they're be
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar and you know I grew them
side-by-side and saw that so but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the argument lately like is
epigenetics real is you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure all this stuff is real,
but I think what extent and then what is
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know that that's kind of A hot
topic right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just listening to another podcast or
like well now the hormones change the
[SPEAKER_01]: change the structure of the plant and
stuff like that and You know definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: have done like fingerprinting the DNA and
looking at it before and after you know
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no change that's happening right
at the DNA level But I think if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at styles good bacteria is bad bacteria is
pests all that stuff plays into it right
[SPEAKER_01]: like even microclimates too, I guess I
heard about a lot too, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in Grass Valley, like I think it's
one of the best microclimates in
[SPEAKER_01]: California And what I can do there,
you know what I can pull out of you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain and you know We grew in in the
Central Valley for five or six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like totally different,
you know, but I think this is all becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: like fashion it's becoming cyclical and
Seeing some of the old stuff come back
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly like tissue culture We knew we
had to to do it, you know at one point
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know mean when me and Jay got
together like it was really we were trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it for for in-house like For for
what we were developing Trying to clean up
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetics like at that point like,
you know coming from the 215 into the 64
[SPEAKER_01]: error Yeah, I remember Crockett growing in
in Monterey and that's when the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: we started learning about SSI drift,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and then what what's in those plants
to like, you know, we all shared genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: back then You didn't know what someone's
IPM protocols were, you know, like they
[SPEAKER_01]: were spraying some bad stuff You get it
and you know microbutanol and in four bit
[SPEAKER_01]: like that stuff was in there for
generations yeah, you know and we really
[SPEAKER_01]: went down the route of tissue culture to
remove that and We were trying to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: our property and in Yolo County was
hitting like a bunch of speed bumps and
[SPEAKER_01]: all sudden there's like thousands of
plants, you know starting to back up and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we became a nursery by accident,
you know, like Jay I just remember like
[SPEAKER_01]: standing and there were Jay and Bo and the
nursery and we're looking at all these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants like we have nowhere to put them,
you know I was like, I guess we start
[SPEAKER_01]: selling them, you know, and and even like
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember You know at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have enough Plants to sell at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to tell everyone we're doing
sort of been like 16 17 I think and people
[SPEAKER_01]: at the Emerald Cup are like I'd say like
25% got it and like we we were like
[SPEAKER_01]: showcasing we had like 10 plants to
showcase, you know and People were looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at us like, you know multiple peel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is GMO, you know, like You or
Monsanto or like this is a practice that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been used for 40 years in trying to
explain it why it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I mean the old days I mean I
have so many people So many people like in
[SPEAKER_01]: the old days like all you need to do is
put that that genetic back outside for a
[SPEAKER_01]: full moon cycle It'll be totally the same
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll like reset everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know and so it's funny because
DJ short he told me this is a long long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago when I was super excited about
tissue culture like I was like this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Graham when Bill Graham was the
tissue culture guy back and you know 2009
[SPEAKER_00]: or 2010 or something like that I was super
excited and I was sitting next to DJ short
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was telling him how I want to learn
tissue culture and he's like actually all
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do is put that plant in the
ground and You do that in the spring and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna take fresh cuts every year
off that you'll get the same results as
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Depending on who's tissue culture,
you know Because I'm sure you might get
[SPEAKER_00]: better results than certain people that
are doing tissue culture They don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing and there's different
types of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand that either They
think all tissue culture is the same and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not no mirror stem tissue culture
When you're using undifferentiated cells
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot harder to do a lot more
time-consuming a lot more time-consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Just being able to do nodal
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and I think there's a lot
of these kits and the kits are great Ways
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to learn and develop an
understanding for tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think they are The future of
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are gonna have labs like you
have a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lab We have labs we have
technicians to know what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn some of it on your own But
to take it to the level that you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: at is very very difficult for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you know understanding that
at scale is There's very few people that
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it we in the world you guys are at
a scale that no one Else is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean no one no one else is even
touching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool It's cool to see like I said,
it's world-class group of people Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there is a pathologist from UC
Davis, you know She actually wrote most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the primers for for PCRs and stuff like
that You know to see some of the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know, again, I'm a geek at heart
You know, like I wrote software developed
[SPEAKER_01]: software developed, you know hardware too
for 15 years as I was like also in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis You know growing in my garage So
I'm a geek at heart So for me like
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing, you know a form of tech or
biotech and what cannabis is with my dream
[SPEAKER_01]: space Yeah, and we started it at finest
like when me and Jay and this is like just
[SPEAKER_01]: the next iteration, you know and
conceptions also now like getting ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: open up a lab in Portugal and you know,
we've spent time in Spain the last couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years together and and You know trying to
get into the Germany market like it's best
[SPEAKER_01]: dinners ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yes, it's just it's it's cool to see
like, you know, like I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people are looking at California in the
problems we have here but like I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in You know, we're all we're all
kind of treading water, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like there's a I think the good time
is still coming You know, it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people talk about the the good old times
but I think moving forward from you know
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and and Just the science side of
things like I think we're we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to You know starting to push
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with tissue culture I I wanted to do
this subject justice in my book and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: had Matt Snyder from apical biotech he
wrote the chapter and I didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the chapter it was but but I feel
like it's such an important thing to have
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of moving forward in the
future because if you want clean genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: either you're gonna be growing from seed
or you're gonna be going from tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture plants, it's not a lot of Clone
propagation unless it was from tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture because there's so much many
problems with everything not just hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think a lot of people focus on
hoplite and veeroid but it's like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just one of One of 20 issues like more
than more than that one of 50 issues it
[SPEAKER_01]: could probably have and I think we're
still learning about them too,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, you know the whole nodal
Maristem right now like we test right for
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 pathogens, right and okay, it's clean
You can use nodal or do you use Maristem,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like back and forth we do both,
you know, like and I think Maristem is
[SPEAKER_01]: also a Kind of like an insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what if we find something new that
has been sitting in that tissue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, like we're just
propagating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting and then I don't know if
you read the article Kevin McNamara from
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal genomics Just started talking a
lot about HPLBD being, you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted now to pollen like we thought
it was you know, just through Dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't read that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty definitely need to read that
Because I was always curious whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: can transmit hoplite through pollen I
think we talked about that on the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time on the podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like totally at that point, like people
thought 10-15 percent, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like don't quote me on the exact number
But I think it was 50-60 percent like he's
[SPEAKER_01]: saying like 50-60 percent transmission
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what cuz yeah We were saying
purple city genetics did a study and they
[SPEAKER_00]: found 10 percent transmission 10 7 I
believe it was 7 to 10 but Kevin McKernan
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever he says I I would go with a lot
of stuff that he Says he's super smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some amazing stuff over
there and yeah, we so resistant strange
[SPEAKER_01]: find stuff that's resistant to hoplite and
Veroid but and We've been we you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that we bring into culture at a
conception actually gets to tested with
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal genomics Yeah, so we're doing
the mapping of the genome, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're also trying to work super full
genome Yeah on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, like the whole the whole
mind proposition is you know, like a
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery like can This is this right and
who's who's were you taking taking my
[SPEAKER_01]: word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where did I get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like did I get the right one to take
it the wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're using my floor DNA same
idea, but it's like the fingerprinting
[SPEAKER_00]: technology is there You might not be able
to tell if it was a sister or if it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent if it was related But at
least you could tell if it's the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing and it just keeps us keeps us
all honest because there's so much Cut
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing going on the cut fishing game is
just it's so bad and it's like it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: going on forever Because somebody gets
something they're like, well they they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to protect whatever same thing with
crosses down the road It's like I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand people wanting to rename stuff
to protect their IP because we can't fully
[SPEAKER_00]: protect IP but like Renaming other
people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So taking credit for other people's
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's sad It's it's sad and it's been
happening but but we can see the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: it not happening So you guys can make sure
it doesn't happen that you know at least
[SPEAKER_00]: to the best of your ability and that's all
we can do Yeah, I mean like right now none
[SPEAKER_01]: of this is enforceable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right because like if you take it to
court, where's it gonna go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna go it's gonna go nowhere and
any federal judge is gonna look at and
[SPEAKER_01]: like get it on my court Yeah, like it's
still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not allowed to be doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't sue each other, you know No,
yeah, but I think you know again and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: making baby steps and you know,
there are patents getting pushed in Well
[SPEAKER_00]: in selling clones if you're gonna sell
clones, you might as well finger breath
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what it is in the bigger
library you have to put it against you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find out if it's original if it's
something The same as somebody else's But
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes baby steps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one at a time and one foot in front
of the other and till you have a big
[SPEAKER_01]: library and I think it's important for the
the genome to like I think Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of the data that the genomes
like sequenced against data again Like the
[SPEAKER_01]: data who's to say that this is the real
data, you know, like exactly Who's to say
[SPEAKER_00]: this OG Kush is the real OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're relying on the person that
gave it to you Yeah, and that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with phylos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was stuff there was 70 or a
hundred different things in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: were named different things other than OG
Kush that were just OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so Then it just it becomes like
where did you source it?
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way to really do that and in my
mind is from the breeder and Holding
[SPEAKER_00]: holding the breeder accountable if you
know, I think that's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think that's where we're starting right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're starting, you know,
like I said everything on the menu goes
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the breeder Yeah, you know like
not just the royalty but like the gene
[SPEAKER_01]: like mapping and doing You know saying
okay, this is you know stamped in history
[SPEAKER_01]: of what they created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're protecting them Hopefully this
is also opening up a way for patents and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff moving forward but it you know,
like when we saw what What happened with
[SPEAKER_01]: corn and soy and stuff like that with
Monsanto like none of this work was being
[SPEAKER_01]: done, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all of a sudden Monsanto comes
out and you know blankets gets patents on
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and then starts showing small
farmers and forcing them to use seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully this is this is that path
forward Like we've all put a lot of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: time money into creating these things and
this is a way to like, you know Who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: where this industry is going?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like hopefully this is one of
the ways of like cementing that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this is mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've created this and you know stamping
that that portion so and and again like it
[SPEAKER_01]: just You know, this regulation is gonna
just start, you know breeding more
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation Yeah, I mean I think that when
you can start really capturing data and
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding people to be honest accountability
is so important having someone say one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as opposed to Proving one thing
where you have the data and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a great thing So especially
when people like Monsanto or whoever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know I mean, I think there's gonna
be a lot of people that want to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab a patents and protect stuff That's
not necessarily novel but that you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be original Yeah, I think
again going back to the gene numbing like
[SPEAKER_01]: the sequencing like That's still a huge
portion of this plant that we have not
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to really do R&D on yet You know
like the the medicinal the true the true
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal side of it Yeah, and the gene
numbing, you know is a step in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction It's very difficult to a lot of
people don't understand this this
[SPEAKER_00]: studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very difficult because You're
talking about a plant that changes from
[SPEAKER_00]: micro variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can change extremely in a period of 70s
70 days of flour or you know, the veg plus
[SPEAKER_00]: the flour whatever but we're looking at a
chemo type that could be changed by
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of the environment or nutrition
very easily right and so and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: some stress factors can cause it to change
and so it's hard to fully study something
[SPEAKER_00]: that changes so much unless you can have a
Chemo type that stays the same word like
[SPEAKER_00]: for manufacturing drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean how many times have you saw
something on the Vine cut it down put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bag and be like, oh that's that's
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not there anymore So many times,
especially if you know hunting it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the winners aren't always the winners You
know when you're when you're selecting on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant as opposed to in the bag It's
amazing what a day or two can do to like
[SPEAKER_01]: walk in and be like wow That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then tomorrow's gone, you know,
it's just what yeah was it environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: was it You know just one portion of that,
you know that that makeup showing for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second, you know One of these flavor
molecules can be deceiving So a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people if you go by just the smell and you
don't actually taste it Sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: taste isn't there or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like mild, but then you taste
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like wow, it's overwhelming It's not
always the case a lot of stuff that's loud
[SPEAKER_00]: as loud when you smoke it, too But it's
it's interesting some of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: have like softer softer like smell on the
nose and then you you hit it and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: wow It's like then you get softer turps,
but sometimes they're just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the skittles was like a
perfect example of that like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a friend in Turkey had a mobile
dispensary up there and that was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time I ever saw skittles like I was
dropping off some pounds to him for the
[SPEAKER_01]: menu and he was like check this out and
Pick up the bag and it's depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And yeah at this time depth's
probably going for two grand twenty two
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred dollars and he's like this is
skittles and I was like kind of ugly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and so I think people usually
say right Yeah, I was like what you pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like 3,600 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like what he's like open it open it
as small as like that is different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's like now let's go smoke it,
you know, and Yeah, I mean, it's never
[SPEAKER_01]: judge a book by its cover and I think a
lot of these You know a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions are done wrong too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wish everything's blind taste us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how it should be done That's
how we do our funerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everybody gets joints now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one gets flour I know what the flour
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just smoke it and then we can talk
about that Taste and the effect fortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: goes back to the the marketing the
Instagram like, you know people want to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see it like yeah I mean I'm
excited about the day where they trust the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand enough to where they don't have to
see the flower They can just buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll and be super happy and pay
premium prices on a premium flower
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll They're getting super fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also they need to smoke it fresh
especially something like a joint where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been ground up and then put into a
piece of paper and smoked you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke That sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have as long of a shelf life
once you start fucking with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I definitely see brand You know
recognition and brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like you said like it's tough It's
you know, like here in California like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know consumer packaged product like it
takes a month to get it to the shelf Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's impossible like to To get any
quicker, you know, and but I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, like D to C is is is come in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't really taken off yet I think
right but you know, like hopefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know with the market maturing and
stuff people are gonna start Like becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: loyal to brands, you know, like you see
with with wine or beer, you know We have a
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly membership package for seeds and I
can't wait to the day where I can go to
[SPEAKER_00]: all these Yeah, all these farmers and all
these guys with facilities that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with yeah and get some sort of
monthly membership package in the mail You
[SPEAKER_00]: know where you get you get the new stuff
that's coming down or maybe you get to be
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the feed on it or whatever I think
that monthly membership package is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of it's great, but we can't do
it yet in California Yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the county that I'm in trying to
push that that farmers market model Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, there's so many, you know hoops and
things to jump through but I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming Yeah, I mean you can go to wineries
and you can hear stories about the
[SPEAKER_00]: winemaker and how they made the wine and
then get to taste the wine there I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see Humboldt and you know
Trinity and Mendocino and Sonoma
[SPEAKER_00]: especially to be able to go up there and
you go check out the farm and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: watch them harvest if they're harvesting
or at least hear the stories and try the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and yeah Have a chill area and then
you can experience the different terroir
[SPEAKER_00]: from one region to the next or one Yeah,
one climate to the next I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where like the hash side to like,
you know, this is like what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about It's usually a little more protiquy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think you know, I remember the
first time cutting down A greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: freezing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was probably 15 16,
you know, like where there was like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of the 215 into the it wasn't
we weren't regulated yet, but it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like prices were crashing but the hash
prices were up and it felt so weird to
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze a whole house ended up screwing it
up royally like, you know, my body was
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'll just vacuum seal it throw it in
the freezer to me vacuum silly pull out
[SPEAKER_01]: and crush the flower and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but like I think you know being able to
to put it into a shelf life a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer and stuff like that Like when rosin
and extract is a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a joint You don't actually get
to see the flower and you're just basing
[SPEAKER_00]: it on especially on the taste and the
effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day rosin you you can
go by what it looks like a little bit But
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, that's where like the outdoor these
guys are doing outdoor rosin like top
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty amazing call you a lot like
yeah, maybe A lot of washing for me on the
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the type six side And I think
you know that group is one of the best and
[SPEAKER_01]: best in the business You know also work
with paper planes like we have a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that stuff is going to live resin
I like live resin a lot and I was up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and I smoked a bunch of amazing
live resin up there and Some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: just stuck on the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with rosin rosin is
amazing too, but some good live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just skittles live rosin nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's I love that stuff when it's
like when it's on that level Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I think you know pho hydrocarbon
got a bad name because of the The
[SPEAKER_01]: refinement they were doing for a bit all
the carbons and stuff They were you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: purifying it with it just came all
monoterp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah I know exactly what you're
talking about with they're filtering it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using charcoal and some other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and stuff Yeah, isn't necessarily
healthy and I mean it was like I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: being up and humble, you know,
like people Saying you know turn your mold
[SPEAKER_01]: into gold, you know, and I think it just
goes back to the the product You're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in you know, whether it's rosin
resin, whatever it is Like if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting quality material then quality
quality out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean this market like you have to have
price points, you know, like different
[SPEAKER_01]: price price regions like Rosin is a little
more higher shelf right and not everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: can afford it, you know But like live
resin a lot of people can afford that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, and again going back To you know
techniques and things like that and great
[SPEAKER_00]: product I remember 2013 when the sauce
first came out from holy water do that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was so nuts, you know 30% turps on
something that which was like turp
[SPEAKER_01]: overload Yeah seeing some of the first
shatter and stuff and spoke it with some
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like cracking and popping No,
like don't know about this stuff again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know regulations spring innovation and
getting chemists and stuff involved now
[SPEAKER_01]: and products are getting better Safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah made in the actual lab environment
not just on someone's porch or a herpeta
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah interesting times man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be part of the evolution of
something this big That's gonna be this
[SPEAKER_00]: impactful over the next however many years
in the future that humanity exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Impacting all of that future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember you saying like,
you know putting out the book and in doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this podcast It's like it's solidifying
our our stamp on this history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You know people coming, you know in
front of us or you know, like I think With
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation like a lot of people forget
about what we went through You know and
[SPEAKER_01]: not just me but like everybody everybody
we so easily forget about stuff Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you document it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think it's important because
like, you know, I've been rated You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we've been harassed, you know,
like in the county like I took a step
[SPEAKER_01]: forward with actually that the whole Group
of children that we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know supplying them tinctures
and all this stuff like our county Decided
[SPEAKER_01]: that they wanted to ban all commercial
cultivation and they banned all commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation They made the mistake of
actually putting it on the ballot Yeah to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask the county like do you want to
regulate cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny, you know, I think like this
industry a lot of times we have so much
[SPEAKER_01]: like headbutting You know, and you have
all these different layers of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, get the hippies you guys got the you
know all these all these different people
[SPEAKER_01]: like and For once it was cool to be a part
of because like everyone came together
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're like, okay This is us versus
them, you know, we ended up getting 75% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the boat, you know, like in politics is
insane Strategically we had some great
[SPEAKER_01]: people helping us like Heather Burke
lawyer like she always kept us out of jail
[SPEAKER_01]: and but you know, she really was like
pivotal on like structuring this and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, like it was a cool thing to be part
of because we You know the county it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of funny the county Nevada County
Grass Valley, Nevada City is such a split
[SPEAKER_01]: county from super crazy liberals to like
super crazy Conservatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally and it's like it's this huge
opposite end of the spectrums and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, obviously it was it was pretty easy
to like talk to the liberals and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them might not wanted You know regulation
coming but you know, the conservatives
[SPEAKER_01]: like we we played a different You know
different levels and would talk to them
[SPEAKER_01]: about this also going back to land rights
and stuff like that and just You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we came and came together and was
able to like, you know get Get it
[SPEAKER_01]: overturned and you know now regulated and
and to me again, I go back It's it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the I think it's one of the best
microclimates and in all of California
[SPEAKER_01]: like Does it's it's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going on up to you know up to the
Sierra Nevadas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the foothills So you're getting like,
you know some of the heat coming from The
[SPEAKER_01]: valley but then also these great little
pockets of super dry too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, super dry Yeah, I think it's one of
the better microclimates and in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because Between the mid part of
California all the way through Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for outdoor cultivation That's the
best in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's one of the seven Mediterranean
Climates right like it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately like, you know I think when
all this kind of figures itself out like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're advanced to that portion where You
can take indoor and you can throw it in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York Throw in anywhere in the world
the right person running it with the right
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics like you're gonna get a
comparable Product right, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but again, it's just like no one has the
Sun we have here No one has a climate we
[SPEAKER_01]: have here, you know and for either hash
production or you know outdoor It can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really be no and I'm not saying there's
not other places that it can't be grown
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and duck Well, and I think you
know, there's places in New Mexico and
[SPEAKER_01]: places in Arizona that seems so great Some
great has come out of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah with and I laugh because like I grew
up Watching, you know the thunders storms
[SPEAKER_01]: and the hailstorms and even portion in New
York It's you know hurricanes in
[SPEAKER_01]: September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, you know the the
weather and stuff that this plant gets
[SPEAKER_01]: beat up out there too But I've seen some
great stuff come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gene West I don't know if you know jeep
and then he had kick-ass farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Grass Valley Okay, he used to be
a Marlboro man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay amazing guy Yeah, he was always doing
really Creative things that were I think
[SPEAKER_00]: really smart But one of the things he did
that shocked me was he did this technique
[SPEAKER_00]: called stock splitting you could only do
in Grass Valley or in someplace that was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely dry because he would judge the
planets out about you know, yay high and
[SPEAKER_00]: he would instead of super cropping or
topping them to get the hormones to Shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: out more branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would take and use a buck knife split
the stock down and then tape it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and then Without it would do it
would have the same effect as topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would have these huge plants with
so many bud sites and you do that So he'd
[SPEAKER_00]: split it crossways once down and then he'd
split those and so I mean you would run
[SPEAKER_00]: the buck knife Yeah, you know he had this
video that always gives me like the
[SPEAKER_00]: shivers and I see it like dude You're
killing that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went out and saw his plants and they
were just amazing big huge tall plants
[SPEAKER_00]: That he had topped like that and you could
only do that because of Botrytis and other
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal pathogens I think in my opinion you
could probably only do that in a handful
[SPEAKER_00]: of places in the world and be super
successful with it but he also watered
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so dry he was able to water
from the top of the plant in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, and then he would water from the
bottom in the afternoon to cool the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and So yeah, he was doing all kinds of
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big Grass Valley guy amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's doing other stuff right now,
but Like so many people in this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: have gone kind of into other occupations
Yeah, some of these people, you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: that definitely, you know scream You know
the benefits and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, like some of them aren't
here anymore Yeah, I mean we've lost a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Jay being one of them but
so many innovative people too and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also other people just quitting because it
got so hard Yeah, and that's why I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cultivation is on my jam I'd
rather be into the picks and shovels and
[SPEAKER_00]: on the genetics much much preferred
because that's where my passion is it
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway is with you know, I feel like I
like exploring Feel like an explorer from
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the like we're going into new
territory that people haven't seen stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen these profiles before and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm constantly looking to be surprised to
surprise myself Yeah, but it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is I I share that thought with
you on the breeding side of thing like
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I think I'm like a serial
entrepreneur like I always want to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like my whole life you are Like
my whole life is like my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: professional life has always been like,
you know startups in the tech industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: startups here and yeah, you know,
like there's something about me that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to go forward and be ahead of it,
you know, like and Breeding kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: clears, you know satisfies that you know,
cuz I'm always getting something new,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know trying to Put something new out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's the long play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the long game for sure Yeah,
breeding is not just the quick money the
[SPEAKER_00]: quick this or the quick that it's it takes
a lot of time to do it successfully to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the like picks and
shovels that like I think now more than
[SPEAKER_01]: ever like genetics are Or are worse more
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like not having the right
genetic right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, of course, but but it proves a
point right it's Like if you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong thing even just green right now and
you're playing the wholesale game It's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be super hard to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you know, if you have a purple
candy runs cross or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like yeah it and Having the
right thing and understanding that the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and what the market's asking for to
like it's again it goes back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: procurement and that's one of the things I
do love about what I'm doing right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to curate a menu of You know a
percentage of them Have to be what the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry wants but trying to find the best
ones the newest ones the unique ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and then having a portion of the
menu of You know people putting things in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jars and you know cultivators that
don't have the time to breed or phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt and you know unique strains and in
unique terpenes or cannabinoid profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: like Yeah, it's cool to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's great time to be alive So if
people are interested in finding more out
[SPEAKER_00]: about you, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting ready to launch my website,
but Instagram counterculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Christian with a K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a counterculture counter
underscore culture underscore CA pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: active on it conception nurseries is
Conception nurseries calm same thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Instagram as well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well one last question So if you had one
piece of advice for your younger self
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just starting out in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like you know people use
a lot of the same don't give up and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I was actually having a conversation
with a friend on the way here this morning
[SPEAKER_01]: and and you know, I think it's Tenacity,
you know, like I was using the analogy of
[SPEAKER_01]: a baseball.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love baseball.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up a Big big Yankee fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandfather grew up in New York
watching in the Bronx watching,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Yankees play some of my
first memories are are you know being you
[SPEAKER_01]: know going to to Yankee games and stuff
like that, but I use the analogy of
[SPEAKER_01]: business right it goes back again to like
you know being an entrepreneur like
[SPEAKER_01]: pivoting and baseball if you hit three out
of ten you're going to the hall thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right and I think in this industry,
especially right now like we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: really down on ourselves because Just the
state of it's in you know, it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking roller coaster for sure and from
cultivation to money being you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like so all the games that we have to play
right, you know the tenacity and I'm still
[SPEAKER_01]: in it like a year ago like I was
questioning what I was doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like cuz I had a good, you know path on on
on the tech side, but it's really just
[SPEAKER_01]: tenacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this was there was no recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no book to follow like we've all
made mistakes in this tree and I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like just keep going keep going like don't
don't let certain things pull you down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like honestly losing Jay was a
big honestly, I didn't have the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually process it because like I was
literally in the middle of building a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally left there went to his funeral
for 30 hours and had to come back and go
[SPEAKER_01]: right back to work, you know, and it's
just you know, I feel like I've been on
[SPEAKER_01]: this course of this industry for a reason
and it's almost like a blind faith kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I think what I would tell myself
is just keep pushing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like again, like you said can't really
can't really rely on what was in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's in the future, but just being in
the moment I probably actually I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: probably take that from you enjoying the
moment a little bit more, you know being
[SPEAKER_01]: being more present not trying to worry
like, you know things covered or or
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about the mistakes we made in the
