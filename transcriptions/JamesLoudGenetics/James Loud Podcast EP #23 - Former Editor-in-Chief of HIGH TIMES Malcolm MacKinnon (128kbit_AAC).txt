[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA dragged away the crops and seeds
were scattered everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was so there's feral hemp growing
all over the reservation now, courtesy of
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Malcolm McKinnon,
previously from High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing photographer, good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't talked that much in the last
maybe five years, but he's a great guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm glad to have you on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks so much, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I toured your grow rooms in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent a few days together, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were, you know, you brought in all
those great artists at the Cannabis Cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you were part of High Times
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were in deep there during the Cannabis
Cups, during the golden age of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Cups, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were amazing times, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole world's changed a lot since back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, especially for High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, talk about this, just so you know,
former colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the real problems is
for High Times is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the outlaw edge is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's you know, cannabis is
becoming more and more mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is High Times now, you know,
protesting against?
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a very, very definite
opposition to government control and any
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what High Times was.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times motto was, you know,
like, do what the hell you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't hurt anybody and the
hell with anybody else, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the whole cannabis thing has
kind of changed High Times a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they made some real poor decisions
in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the publishing industry has certainly
been a problem because you see magazines
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, anywhere, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you can't really see any
more except the dentist's office,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's everything's changed in the
industry as far as media is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of pot magazines out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't really say a lot of good
things about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be covering their advertisers
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for rolling on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I can't really get real
excited about cannabis media these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, you know, there are a lot of
corporate entities now in the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you want to cover these
people fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you used to have to have some balls
to be involved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even on the media side to do an
event, you had to have some balls to go
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and try to do an event because
they wouldn't always allow you to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if you'd planned and paid for permits
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember Cannabis Cup,
I guess it was, I can't remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 2011, 2012 in Amsterdam,
we had 150 cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in and raid and raid the Cannabis
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, it was it was unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, they thought a drug park
was going on, which is a drug park in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe is, you know, where people are
doing meth and they're doing shooting up
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, then we listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that people don't realize,
a lot of people who are newcomers to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the Johnny come lately that
cannabis was very, very dangerous to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people went to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people had their families broken
up, had their property taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Via these draconian RICO laws,
those forfeiture laws, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, terrible stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think when people, you know,
these days don't understand that the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry stands on the shoulders of these
people, the entrepreneurs, the growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dealers who kept this plant alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, it was dangerous during
the Reagan Bush administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was downright dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinton was no better, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Obama wasn't even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we there was a lot of persecution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a pot, the war on drugs has been a war
on pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because meth is dangerous and heroin is
dangerous and cocaine is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say the people who are dealing
with that stuff, they're dangerous people
[SPEAKER_00]: at pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are pretty peaceful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the cops come in, they seize
everything, seize your property,
[SPEAKER_00]: break up your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hell of a lot easier than dealing
with with meth dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the war on drugs has been a war on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, from from the beginning,
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when Richard Nixon declared the
war on drugs, he was holding up a pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it wasn't holding up needles or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it was it was also a war on
hippies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, it was a war on
counterculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was more than just drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was it sure was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people have pointed out to me
that you realize it around since 78,
[SPEAKER_00]: 79, you know, disco got real popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these polyester shirts and,
you know, looking like a disco guy really
[SPEAKER_00]: became the popular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it seemed to be this insidious
war on hippie culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly you have this manufactured music.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have John Travolta dancing around
in tight pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, what the hell happened to the
culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, seriously, because the 60s and
70s, man, it was all about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie and, you know, the great rock
groups of those times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things change, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back into your history a
little bit and start talking about your
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences with cannabis from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my experience from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I went to the University of
Michigan in 1975 and Ann Arbor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, is was the most liberal place
for pot in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a five dollar desk appearance
ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were walking down the street
smoking a joint, if you had an ounce,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was only a twenty five dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those these laws predated the
legalization by decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I went to school and I
experienced some of the greatest pot ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had some Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one time I just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was having an anxiety attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff must have been just off the
hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought I was going nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only anxiety attack I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, you know, going to University
of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I I went to New York to
become an actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was a theater major.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a master's in theater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to New York to become an actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, did a few different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved into the fitness
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a top aerobics instructor,
taught in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of the pro Reebok team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I led New York Sports Club during the
aerobic boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got sick of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ran into Peter Gorman, who was an editor
of High Times at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he recommended me to photograph some
of his stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, you know, working on as a
photographer for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got better and better at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a real, real break for me to
go to High Times and start a career there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my first full feature in 1991,
but I did have a feature, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: had had had work published in 1989.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where it started in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I became a photo editor, that features
editor, that a senior editor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I became an editor at Hemp Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, you know, really, it was a
wonderful place to really hone my
[SPEAKER_00]: photography, find out, you know,
how good a photographer I could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also learning about Canada
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this was a real education for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the people who were involved
with High Times and were involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing drugs, were very, very driven
people, intelligent people, very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, it was a great, great break for
me out of the fitness industry in the High
[SPEAKER_00]: Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, High Times opened up the doors for
me in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many things I was able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many celebrities I've interviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many experiences I've had are all
because of High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a great affection for High
Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 25 years there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years, my God, that's a quarter
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's over a third of my life
when you get down to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, it was a tremendous
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it all started in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, seriously, you know,
High Times was my, my entrance into the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of cannabis and meeting all these
people, people like you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very righteous people,
people who were really brilliant seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, plenty of, you know,
big time dealers and celebrities and
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the cannabis industry who are
really leaders or doing their thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on the sly and loud seeds was
one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I visited you in San
Francisco, things were still, you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep things undercover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was still a very,
very dicey arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I visited you and, you know,
touring your grow rooms with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we drove down to LA together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was pot being delivered down there
to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only 10 years ago, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say that they're pioneers,
or that they've forged a path on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own, I ain't buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what people went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the work had to be done by the
activists, the entrepreneurs, the dealers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people kept this plant alive while it
was being, you know, vilified by the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generations before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm standing on the shoulders of
giants in the breeding world, the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation cannabis, people like you
that, you know, believed in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, tried to make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I think we all did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we realized what we were
involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the exciting thing about
being with High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly, it was just the fact that we felt
like we were we were on a mission of some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't doing People magazine or,
you know, a food magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing cannabis and it was
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, the government tried to
stop shut down Night Times a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: times, first with Green Merchant in the
early 90s when they actually subpoenaed
[SPEAKER_00]: UPS's records to find out who was buying
hydroponic equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a war on growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going after them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, if you ordered hydroponic equipment,
you might have the DEA showing up your
[SPEAKER_00]: door and say, can we see what you're doing
with that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how bad it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, in 2003, 2004,
Operation Headhunter and Operation Pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreams, when they went after the bong
industry, they tried to go after our
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had very, very heavy advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times at that point in the glass
industry were getting tons of glass ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bongs were huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they went after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they arrested 57 people for shipping
bongs and paraphernalia over state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they busted 57 people, including Tommy
Chong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy Chong was the only one of that group
that went to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to prison for 10 months for
manufacturing a bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not that long ago, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of the country, it remains
very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stigma is slowly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see it with the older
generations and also the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: generations like myself that are getting
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of people in the
United States that have tried cannabis on
[SPEAKER_01]: some level, whether it's an edible or a
joint or whatever, whether it's high
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the stigma is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think especially in places like
California, New York, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have this area in the center of the
country where slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even look at look at Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Oklahoma is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of the deep,
deep south states, Alabama, Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_00]: are that are not friendly to marijuana at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're still taking your life in
your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska ain't so cool either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in Colorado, you have a choice
of Nebraska or Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those both borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard of people crossing
state lines of Colorado going into Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cops are just waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look like a hippie car.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to pull you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out if you got pot in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a money thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, listen, the war on drugs
is all about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I put a lot of people,
you know, a lot of people made money off
[SPEAKER_00]: the war on drugs, you know, prosecutors,
states, you know, all the revenue people
[SPEAKER_00]: had to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Court costs, all that kind of stuff,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, we incarcerated
millions in the United States has the most
[SPEAKER_00]: people in prison in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We imprisoned people for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm no granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of bad people,
you know, who should be in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if there's an
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard people talk about,
you know, are there alternatives to
[SPEAKER_00]: prison?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really, really difficult
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember interviewing this woman named
Maya Shenwar, an attorney in Chicago in
[SPEAKER_00]: the high and high times, and she said,
you know, listen, did prison evolves?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, people used to put
people in chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, I think we're still a very
primitive society as far as how we treat
[SPEAKER_00]: people who disobey the law, you know,
especially when it comes to drugs and our
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of people who have addiction
compared to places like Norway and
[SPEAKER_01]: countries like Norway and Portugal and
people addiction, especially 100 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember kind of remembering we're
discussions like this on talk shows back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest to God talking about why are we
treating people with addictions like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we putting them in jail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we treating them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it cheaper to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are like I say, the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we always talk about how great a
country we are and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you, it just drives me
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stupidity of our politicians and it's
all policy driven, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kowtowing to their parties, leaders and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody's on the same page as
far as nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing changes to get people to actually
come out and, you know, use their backbone
[SPEAKER_00]: to support something that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, suddenly they're a maverick or a
rebel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking common sense is
completely bizarre in this country these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Common sense is not so common,
but you know, it's just it's so money
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated and a lot of it's motivated by
greed as well, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't I don't even know
what the answers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a difficult time right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to agree with with our political
landscape and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if people smoked a little more
pot, I think everybody would calm down a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you see what happened in
Woodstock in 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's doing, you know, hard drugs for a
fool, a few fools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you were there any fights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any, you know, any riots or
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to an event and as a pot smoking
event, they know that nothing's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you go, I remember cannabis
cups, you bump into somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bump into somebody at an event where
beer is being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bump into somebody and you lose your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, how many times have we seen
fights in the stands of sporting events in
[SPEAKER_00]: Memphis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it's all motivated by drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people get beer muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but people don't get cannabis
muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to start fighting you
after they smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead in Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the people causing all the
problems were the people drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't seeing the stoners,
the people eating psychedelics pushing and
[SPEAKER_01]: shoving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little pushing and shoving
going on at the second to the last night
[SPEAKER_01]: at Dead in Company in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about some high times
photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorite covers of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a bunch of them, but I still
have I still have my magazines,
[SPEAKER_01]: believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of them was the chocolate box.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the different hash in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolate box.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my I had a very short reign as
cultivation editor, not knowing anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually made me editor for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was my first cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was covering B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a Valentine's Day cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I showed that cover to some
people down in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a daughter who was who was
somewhat autistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she saw the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came over and tried to grab some of the
chocolate off the cover, which were buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty realistic looking covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like February 95, I'm going to
guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that were 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing there was some green
hash and I was so excited to try green
[SPEAKER_01]: hash until I tried it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was probably two or three
years before I found some green hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: paid a bunch of money for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the worst tasting hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe everything that was in
high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as other photography that you've
done for high times, magazine covers,
[SPEAKER_01]: centerfolds, you know, the centerfolds,
it was like a Playboy magazine for weed is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what high times was back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's the way it was
conceived, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to be a kind of like a parody of
high times magazine, Playboy magazine with
[SPEAKER_00]: a centerfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was really thrilled about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to shoot as many centerfolds as
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I shot 35 covers in all that
includes hemp times and high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to shoot incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shot buds, I shot people, shot models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having control of the cover was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you get a cover, you've hit a
grand slam in photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was always shooting for the covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always, always, always, because,
you know, it's a huge rush to see your
[SPEAKER_00]: your image on the cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, you know, there are some times
that, you know, things go great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember we shot Kevin Smith on
the cover and the art director,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank Max put Jason Muse on his shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looked like he, you know,
a devil on the shoulder like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it hit newsstands right as 9-11
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it died on the newsstands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was buying magazines then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some news magazines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very, very disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I remember one year we were we
were limping along toward the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, not really there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our covers were not selling, you know,
like two or three, you know, bombs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shot Jenna Jameson for the cover,
the the porn queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to her house in Arizona and
shot this this cover of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended the year on a bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the things sold off the hook and
that not necessarily saved the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, high times always did well,
but certainly made the owners extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: happy that they ended the year with a
huge, huge paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we we turned in some covers
that were selling in the hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some bad, bad decisions made in
2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to take the pot out of the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This honestly happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought in John Buffalo Mailer,
who was the son of the author Norman
[SPEAKER_00]: Mailer and another man named Richard
Stratton, who was a Hollywood writer,
[SPEAKER_00]: who had spent some time in jail for hash
smuggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought them in and they decided
to make it an outlaw vanity fair,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the readers roundly rejected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a few months, high times was on its
deathbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not an exaggeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the owners decided that they had made a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rushed back to cannabis and saved the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the best part of that,
you know, because the publishing industry
[SPEAKER_00]: has been dwindling for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part of all that was that we
decided to finally bring a cannabis cup to
[SPEAKER_00]: America in 2010, the San Francisco Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized we had something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we entered a absolutely golden era of
high time from 2010 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cups were just tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Denver, I think are the fifth
cup we had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 40,000 people show up over a three
day weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had, you know, just so it was
while the publishing industry was
[SPEAKER_00]: dwindling and, you know, it was really
struggling and magazines were closing high
[SPEAKER_00]: times was still holding firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah, so I was with high time
until 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think they've made some
very, very questionable decisions in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were they, you know, they have
massive debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had five CEOs since I left five
different CEOs, which doesn't really bode
[SPEAKER_00]: well for a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently they have massive debt,
which is coming due in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hate to see high times go,
you know, wonderful magazine, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly a huge part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis media is a very,
very dicey things these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I'd be here in the
same place that I'm in without high times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winning the cup in 2012 was a big,
big deal for me and my brand and my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and, you know, all the people
around us that were growing our genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we held our genetics a little
bit a little close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't want them to get out as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've made mistakes along the
way, but high times was definitely pivotal
[SPEAKER_01]: for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first won in 2012, we had no idea
that we were going to win because I'd lost
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost in Seattle entering some extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd done some stuff and we went to
Amsterdam thinking we were just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we had a Cali
connection right across from us with
[SPEAKER_01]: Swerve and his 40 or 50 foot long booth
that was like 20 feet in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, oh, man, these guys know
how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little 10 by 10 and we ended up
winning the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always love that when that happened,
because, you know, the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: Barney's always had these huge booths,
you know, and Cali connection,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it did happen a few times
with DNA first showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a tiny little booth at the Sugar
Shack in Amsterdam, a tiny little booth
[SPEAKER_00]: that they took.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I forget what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was for Chocolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chocolo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they, you know, just it was
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just absolutely put them on the
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Arian from the greenhouse wanted
their strain immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sure you've had dealings
with these guys, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're a winner, they want their
strain, your strain in their coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he wouldn't a cup of the strain
is a is a huge, huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a shame we haven't had a
cup there in years, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, good Lord, like seven,
eight, nine years since we've had an
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were I'll tell you, that was the
most fun I think I've ever had in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry on a regular,
you know, yearly basis because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it really gave Americans a
feeling of what real freedom is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember the first time I was at
the Cup of 1995 and I was there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and I'm smoking a joint in the
window of the coffee shop, having a cup of
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what is, you know, what is,
why is this so forbidden?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most natural thing in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just enjoying, you know,
an evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that, of course, Amsterdam's got me,
you know, he's getting a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting a bit more strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No smoking on the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the amount of coffee shops
compared to back 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's less than a quarter of the amount
of coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a real crackdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're trying to, you know,
like they don't want Amsterdam any longer
[SPEAKER_00]: to have this image of like in any way
anything goes down with the red light
[SPEAKER_00]: district and, you know, buying
psychedelics over the over the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, buying seeds and stuff they
want to soften.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to they want to make their their
their image a little bit more respectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that seems to be what's happening
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's really unfortunate because
that's one of the most beautiful things
[SPEAKER_01]: about Amsterdam is you can go there and be
yourself and get whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you want to smoke,
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take some psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go visit Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just talked to him the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he's sick in the hospital and now
he's out of the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he's doing he's he's in a good
mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but so is a real character.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've known him for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've photographed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've interviewed him for high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's very interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very strange, you know, on
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had some heart problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember he pulled up his shirt and one
of the gattams comes to show his,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bypass car down the middle of
his chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's Soma for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but he's you know, he was a cohort
of Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, you know, before they went
over to the cup in 1995, I remember Soma
[SPEAKER_00]: and Jack were just smoking up the the
entire office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every time we'd go back,
we'd go back and, you know, talk to him
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jack, it was it was a great,
great couple days before the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Steve Hager, he started the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his last year was, I think,
2012, the year I won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of changed the vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve did a wonderful job, invented the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I think I think the people who
started working the Cup after that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably did a better job of just making
it a more marketable experience for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not taking anything away
from Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve didn't have much to do with the
Cannabis Cups after 2008 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he wasn't in the organizing of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So High Times is and the Cannabis Cups are
synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody is taking their cue from
High Times and our events throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had tremendous success.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our Cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see that same success
happening at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now there's all these there's all
these other events, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Emerald Cup has kind of been around,
but now Emerald Cup is this big
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was never like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very underground and and,
you know, very it was a private.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's money to be made,
James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Spannabis is still amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of turned into for a lot of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like how fish is to the Grateful
Ted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we end up at Spannabis every
year seeing the same people that we saw at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cups and we've seen at Cups for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're I think your sensibility
toward cannabis is very, very unlike
[SPEAKER_00]: America's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just more cultured.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, America is capitalism,
you know, cannabis capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's really caused
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: California hasn't brought in the revenue
that they thought they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York doesn't seem to be doing too
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, legal cannabis has been not,
you know, a great success so far as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what the states thought they were going to
bring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black market is alive and well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my favorite issue when I was a kid,
not my favorite photograph, but my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite issue was the million dollar grow
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there was something about
ecstasy in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was like my favorite when I read
a million dollar grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was actually featured in the
next million dollar grow room in 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm trying to get somebody to do the
billion dollar grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some big, big grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Colorado, they started using all
these industrial parts for cannabis out
[SPEAKER_00]: near the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were the biggest growers I have ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an acre of pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just unbelievable stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that there are bigger grow
rooms like that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you think about Holland and all
the flowers they grow and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses that are just lined up for
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this can be done very,
very easily in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see a billion dollar grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kind of things that we
brought to high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a while, it became like,
OK, we've seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it first started happening,
it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started seeing the big giant grow
rooms, people liked seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was also that underlying
feeling like, is this the way we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot thing to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still would you know,
I'm still very much like Jack Herr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see just like growing
everywhere and, you know, have vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: stands, you know, sell it right along with
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hate all the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what made high times great was
because we always encourage people to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: your own, grow your own, grow your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like I like the boutique
cannabis and I like the the microbrewery
[SPEAKER_01]: model for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's definitely that's got a
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be like how alcohol was
where there was just four big companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's what I hope and I expect
for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also see these smaller businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a kid coming in the industry
when I was 14, I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at you want something for
those kids to look up to, it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like they're going to, you know,
the average kid is going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: afford a multimillion dollar business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's who's to say that he can't grow
really good cannabis and eventually build
[SPEAKER_01]: himself into a nice boutique cannabis
brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think people like
anything, there's room for everybody in
[SPEAKER_00]: this business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do your job well, if you know,
if you're a good grower, if you handle
[SPEAKER_00]: your business responsibly and,
you know, I deal with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: similarly honest people, I think you can
do very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's, you know,
regardless of the corporate influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: the influx of corporate people,
I think you can still, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: create your own entity as you did,
James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, you know, you had a
head start because you know, you were
[SPEAKER_00]: laying the groundwork and it's very,
very underground fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, now when you're able to
come out of the closet, you've already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've laid the foundation and
you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So laying the foundation, you know,
what you did, you know, it takes years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to get involved in the
cannabis industry, this is that's what it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, with everything,
it takes years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just it's you want to know
some people have a natural gift,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sure, that's not everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, like just because you
can grow really good, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: perfecting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at scale as you're growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, even if you're not good,
it's like you just do it over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: till you get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as my photography, it's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mean, I started out,
I was I was a good photographer and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: started out with high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I learned over the years
how to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I, you know, I observed
everything, you know, all other
[SPEAKER_00]: photographers, other, you know,
I looked at, you know, thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, you know, try to figure out what
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I over the years,
you know, it took me a long, long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: really say, I think I'm I think I'm a
pretty good photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a long time to actually say
that, you know, it really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least 20 years and I didn't,
you know, when I started, like I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and work with high times, 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think when I say 2011,
I can say like, my photography is fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, just like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm so, so pleased to,
you know, issue this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book is coming out, Pot Shots,
The Journey of a High Times Photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really going to be a historical
documentation through photographs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: of the movement, some of the incidents
that people don't really know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of still life photography,
lots of gardens, lots of buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, models, celebrities,
the leaders who have gotten us,
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten us here, the icons of Cannons,
Jack Herod, Dennis Perrone, Lester
[SPEAKER_00]: Grinspoon, Tommy Chong, all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I photographed and, you know, got to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really it's, you know,
people have been asking for it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's been a slog getting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's I think it's going to be
a real representation of at least my
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which kind of coincides with the
legalization movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these things take time and you
have years and years and years of
[SPEAKER_01]: photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, you know, I was taking snapshot
pictures for a long time and my wife
[SPEAKER_00]: bought me a Canon 81 camera for my
birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 1984.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was, you know, so I started my
photography career regularly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively late in life at 29 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got totally into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I shot in an amateur way for years
and years and years before I did something
[SPEAKER_00]: for high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, you know, I did some some
photography for money prior to work for
[SPEAKER_00]: high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 1989, I did my first feature,
you know, shot some rocket Munaka,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a an editable from India that
Peter Gorman had brought back from his
[SPEAKER_00]: travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I photographed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first photograph in high time,
1989.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been published now, James,
in five different decades, five different
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s, 90s, the zeros, the tens and 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shot two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shot the Dennis Perrone cover and I
wrote an article a January of this year
[SPEAKER_00]: about the New York state of kind,
the first legal harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's five decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were Gordy Howe, if it were
hockey, I'd be Gordy Howe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I always say.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about your working with the
people in South Dakota on the res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2000, Alex Whitepool and some other
people decided to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had pushed an ordinance through
through the tribal government,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then OKed the industrial hemp
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2000, two crops were sown on the
Pine Ridge Reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were both plowed under and raided by
the DEA, by the FBI and by local tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: police.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came in with guns drawn to to seize
the crops and drag them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did it again in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tried to grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2002, they did it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, a court injunction was
slapped on them, a federal injunction,
[SPEAKER_00]: telling them that they couldn't grow
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was lifted in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the funny thing about this in 2000,
when they first raided the crop in 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the the DEA dragged away the crops,
dragged them away and seeds were scattered
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was so there's feral hemp growing
all over the reservation now, courtesy of
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just an amazing thing,
because, you know, this this operation had
[SPEAKER_00]: to cost a half a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a completely for what to seize
a couple of acres of hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, seriously, that's how that's how
crazy things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was there and, you know,
I got to know Alex Whitepool very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been friends with him for 20 years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I mean, there's something I've
been involved with a long time is with is
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Pine Ridge Reservation and their
attempts to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're growing cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legally, and James Loudseeds are in the
ground there, from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vic Camp, who is a very prominent guy,
the reservation is growing James Loudseeds
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were kind enough to donate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so this is something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's legal growing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a couple of dispensaries on the
reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's becoming mainstream
there like everybody everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have tremendous drug problems on the
reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, meth is a real scourge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, nothing cannabis can can can
change that in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly it's an alternative to doing
meth, which is the most destructive drug
[SPEAKER_00]: out there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that and fentanyl fentanyl is
killing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meth is just fucking people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I've, you know, been working
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to the Lakota war pony races every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I play Custer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Custer in a number number of them
where, you know, I kind of ride through
[SPEAKER_00]: all the Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come and try to grab the flag from
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a symbolic thing in the
middle of the race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoever grabs the flag gets like about
five hundred dollars or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been doing that for doing that
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I've gotten got to know the
Lakota people extremely well over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of friends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the things I'm most happy
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in my book, there are a few other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, the example of 1996
Woody Harrelson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I in Kentucky planted four hemp seeds in
order to draw attention to these
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous laws that were outlawing hemp
cultivation in Kentucky, which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest hemp producer in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the country back in the 1800s,
the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he so he orchestrated his own arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there at the planting and I covered
his four years through the legal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was finally acquitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically, and not coincidentally,
the Lakotas plants were raided on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: day that Woody was acquitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that was coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was purposeful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the federal government showing we
don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue to outlaw hemp and
we're going to continue to this mad,
[SPEAKER_00]: mad war on cannabis in any way we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I've had a lot of experiences
that, you know, were afforded through High
[SPEAKER_00]: Times magazine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, the Lakota like so that went
all the way to the federal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to a federal federal court.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to the federal court in
Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, the the the judge said,
although he understood and probably agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the fact that they should be allowed
to grow hemp, it was still up to Congress
[SPEAKER_00]: to change the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he couldn't do anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of where it stopped right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of where it stopped and where it
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think without that, who knows if
hemp would have been legalized and we
[SPEAKER_01]: would have passed the farm bill in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you know, there were there
were experimental crops going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were allowing hemp crops to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, listen, there were experimental
hemp crops growing in Hawaii as far back
[SPEAKER_00]: as 1996, 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the Hawaiian legislature allowed hemp
quarter acre to be grown in experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: crops if it needed to be experimented
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creating experimental hemp crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what what did they expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of experimental crops up
until the point where the farm bill was
[SPEAKER_00]: passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the early 90s, we always thought
it would be a domino effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hemp would start things off,
then medical marijuana, then recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: It came medical first, then recreational,
and then hemp came last.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, seriously, it doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not that pot's legal on the on the
federal level, but certainly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have California and other huge
states, you know, allowing recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, the gloves are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we still have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've come a long way,
but we still have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of this stuff is just so
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make sense necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hardest thing, I think,
for activists back in the 90s and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s was talking to politicians and
trying to explain to them the idiocy of
[SPEAKER_00]: the laws and the sanity of, you know,
using cannabis in a way that could really
[SPEAKER_00]: help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can just get nose or to get
outright hostility or to get people to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, well, this is not an issue that I
want to get involved with because I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: get reelected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been extremely frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was involved on the political
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: By any means, I certainly testified before
a few legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I testified in Vermont and in North
Dakota, and I testified at the Oglala
[SPEAKER_00]: Tribal Council about HEP.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people, they kind of listen,
you know, then they go home, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what's so refreshing about
going to some other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: St. Vincent, for example, I was down there
and we lectured to the Cannabis Authority
[SPEAKER_01]: down there, but they were sincere in the
fact that they wanted to help people with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government, the actual government was
very focused on allowing people to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for medical purposes,
especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't feel like we were a thorn in
their side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the United States, I still feel
like, to a degree, we're like a thorn in
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, they're going to let us do
it, but it just pisses them off a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think things have changed like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, Biden is, you know,
he's an old guy and he, he's no marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's allowed it because I think he
realized that, you know, that most
[SPEAKER_00]: Democrats, most liberals are, you know,
think that, you know, it should be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be, people should be allowed to
use it, but he's no fan of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made that very, very clear over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so he's a certainly,
when he was running for office,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he never spoke out in favor of
cannabis, but still had, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, but he's a hell of a lot better than
the alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's, it's, it's, I,
you know, I, I don't follow the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, marketing my photographs
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm trying to, you know,
market my photography and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm still, I'm, I, I certainly know a
lot of people that tell me about the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's over regulation for the most part
that has caused the industry to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like be stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
And so it's, it's not, it's, it's not all
bad.
It's just that it takes a lot of time to消,
to, to slow down and build trust.
You know, maybe somebody would have
thought it was the first time,
you know, you'd have to fall when it's the
last time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are slowly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what we can do, but yeah,
but this, you know, this high times,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, James was my ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are so many things that I
was able to, to, to accomplish all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different celebrities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Lord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I, but I was with him
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I met, I met Merle Haggard,
you know, I got this guy went to his
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hang out with these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interviewed Oliver Stone, Lewis Black,
Jesse Ventura.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I interviewed Jesse
Ventura, he was still just doing his radio
[SPEAKER_00]: show in Minneapolis in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just called up his radio station and
said, hey, this is high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll get back to you in just a few
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was before he was a national
figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was, you know, he just knew him as a
wrestler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think the future of high
times is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you think that magazine's going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from your inside perspective,
I know it's hard to say, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say, because I've read a
recent article as recent as last week says
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have massive debt and the debt
is coming due, that they have not and that
[SPEAKER_00]: their lender is also having problems and
it could go into receivership,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that high times could be owned
by somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I thought the dispensary
model, like we have a dispensary off
[SPEAKER_01]: Highway 880 in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a great kind of I
thought it was a great thing because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody knows High Times magazine that
smokes from back in the day, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a lot of new people and I
don't think they've done really well like
[SPEAKER_01]: they thought they would or like I hoped
they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apparently they owe an awful lot of
rent on some of these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made some bad deals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the dispensary business is
not the goldmine that everybody thinks it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a 24 7 job, stocking the place,
staffing the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is it's and believe me,
inventory goes fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm sure that, you know,
high times had their problems as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary business in California as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's an overregulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I could read, James, I mean,
I don't have an opinion about where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going because I don't I don't understand
high finance at the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to keep going even though
they're carrying massive debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can tell you from what I
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people can look this up easily
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, you know, Google high times
debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where the magazine is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I have, you know,
you know, fondness for the magazine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I got very, very thankful for my
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I watched the last five,
six years and, you know, kind of wonder
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's going, you know, is it going to
survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like all magazines, you know,
so many magazines have died over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many, believe me, it's,
you know, the only magazines seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing are celebrity magazines,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tabloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the very, very niche magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I say, you don't see magazines
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't people don't go to the
newsstands anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to pick up the latest issue of
Esquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even think to a degree books will be
going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think there's, there's well like
books like yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different kind of book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a book that you're going to,
you know, coffee table book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, even, even books regarding
technology or breeding or growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the access to information on the
internet is just so vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, is dialing the
information in because now it's almost
[SPEAKER_01]: sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go on the internet and there's 20
different ways to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, which one do you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's ratings on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to pick the top rated one,
but maybe that's not necessarily the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not the easiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the future is going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think that's one of the
reasons I think High Times is also
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling because we used to be the go to
source for marijuana cultivation tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and so forth and all the new
innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all, as you said, all of that stuff
is on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can dial this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many videos that, you know,
you don't need to buy High Times any
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that is also, you know,
it's been difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the grow articles are not all that
interesting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can write a thousand words,
you know, in High Times, or you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, read the, read it online and you
can read other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, that becomes a
difficult, difficult for a magazine to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive with all the information they used
to publish this online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Phototrons, if you wanted a
Phototron in 1995, you had to get it from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you go in High Times magazine,
you read about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you could call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could give them a credit card number,
maybe, but, or you could send a check in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a big thing back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd send the check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people know what the Phototron was?
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we've talked about on my
show before, but I, that was my first
[SPEAKER_01]: attempt at growing was in a Phototron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I cut the top off and put it,
you know, 400 Watts light that was taken
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Sun Valley mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always loved reading about the people
who did innovative things to grow very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people would take an ordinary closet,
make a vegetation room on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a flowering room on top and have,
you know, the perpetual harvest in this
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always thought that was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did all the different ways people
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going into Las Vegas and the
guy took me into his garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, no, it's empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a, he had a wall that actually,
you know, came out of the, that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: came out like, you know, like a horror
movie, like it's a secret room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was he, all these shelves actually came
out and you could walk behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, cops had actually come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could not, you know, you know,
and looked at it for something,
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the house for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could not see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would never know it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always, you know, I know I saw a guy
in Santa Cruz once who under the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of his house and he was renting
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a sea of green grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only had three feet of space down
there, but it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had cut his floorboards in his closet
in order to climb down underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: house in order to make a sea of green grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that, that was that kind of
innovation back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one last question before we go,
what was the best thing you ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all these years, you got to have one
standout that, you know, I, I haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a while, but I really like sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, the most intense experience
I ever had was on Oaxaca and that was back
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was spiraling up,
couldn't come down, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How New York of you for sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that is the most popular as far
as, you know, I think there's some other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff going for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Cushman always had a, had a steady,
steady supply of sour diesel in the
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I came to high
times office, I think I scared you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We welcomed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We welcomed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody with the kind of strains you have,
they, you're her best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'm from California,
so I didn't realize you didn't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: smell like weed in New York on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was, it was the office we were
more, more concerned about than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else because always getting complaints
from up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in our high rise, I remember
people below us called us that seventies
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if people are interested in finding
out more about your book, or they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in following you online,
how would they go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my book, I, once it's out,
I will be published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's publicizing it heavily, but you can,
I'm on Facebook, Malcolm McKinnon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm also at M McKinnon photos on
Instagram at M McKinnon photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can follow me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a website, Malcolm McKinnon.com and
Native American photography.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will take you to the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can see my work and I hope they
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, James, we're really,
really happy to have you on the show and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're part of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in my acknowledgments and there's a
photo of you undercover there with your
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco 49ers hat pulled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took some good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, I still have the one of me
shooting pool into the glass jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like one of my favorites of all
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent Alison a few shots, so you
should have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I look forward to talking to you
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can get the guys on the rest
to tune into one of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll try to get them, try to get
them by the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This big's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, James, take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
