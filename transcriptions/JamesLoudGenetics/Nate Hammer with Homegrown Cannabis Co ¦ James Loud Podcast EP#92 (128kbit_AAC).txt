[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Lab podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guest is Nate
Hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Nate?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to be here again, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the deal with the Nate and Matt
and the confusion with your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You caught it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was speaking to Derek Gilman,
ganja the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were doing MJBiz and I wanted
him to come on the show again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he called and my phone rings and I'm
like, how are you doing, Derek?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh, you already know who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this is this Matt?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh, well, can I speak to Nate?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're the same person, mate.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you are?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happened is, as you can tell by my
natty accent, I'm not from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a long time, I wasn't supposed to
be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm working in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I could have got deported pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just came up with a bit of a
pseudonym for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nate Hammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I sort of got recognized by
throughout the years on social media when
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working with all of these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I finally got my green card
and my name was okay to use, which is Matt
[SPEAKER_03]: Hamer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had already stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So call me what you want, mate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call me a little twat if you want
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call you crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we originally met when you came here
with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filmed some stuff at the facility
cleaning their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had brought seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cleaned their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to see your skills firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You met our producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have become friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you get into the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I first moved out here,
I was pretty limited to what I could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started like, you know, working on the
Queen Mary in Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally sat outside Home Depot with
all the other illegals looking for work.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I had a degree in film
because that's what I got before I came
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've had a love affair with America
for a long time, visiting since I was a
[SPEAKER_03]: kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: My uncle moved here in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from the same town as me in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so I just I was doing all of
these jobs I hated to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one day someone offered me an
opportunity up there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Emerald Triangle area, trimming
weed, trimmigrants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I was a trimmigrant for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I was working on a farm up
there, just trimming weed, making way
[SPEAKER_03]: better money than I was making sucking up
shit on the Queen Mary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the owner of one of the ranches I was
working on, we ended up becoming friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, hey, you know, I think I
could teach you how to grow weed instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of just sitting there with some fiskas all
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you come and learn how to do the
business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I spent, you know,
a long time after that doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And long story short is I merged the two
eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a bit of cannabis knowledge and
film knowledge, making cannabis content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price of cannabis dropped and then you
went into film.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: $300 a pound or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was talking to you guys at Terp
Nami recently, talking to Vegas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also Terp Nami was an event that we
just had recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like when outdoor,
I mean, top shelf outdoor goes for $500 a
[SPEAKER_00]: pound now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really disheartening in a lot
of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's way undervalued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like on the streets, this stuff is
still going for a lot more in
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is still going for a lot more
yet the farmers suffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the cost of growing, you know,
has gone down, especially with the led
[SPEAKER_03]: revolution, but still $500 a pound isn't
going to meet, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients have gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power has gone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights have actually gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are some efficiencies to be
had for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are doing double stacks,
but man, it's like, I think there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of mids going on right now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still that small, like 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transitioning from, I mean,
you obviously started with, with a film
[SPEAKER_00]: degree and then you grew cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point you transitioned
into film.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take it way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I grew up in the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, picture me with cobble shoes and
a, you know, dirty face cleaning a chimney
[SPEAKER_03]: like the stereo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I grew up in the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, my, in my early days,
believe it or not, I worked in the fashion
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived between London and New York as a
fashion model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking more like a hooligan,
going to football games, getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: fights, but yeah, another fashion model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me explain the shaved head.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, you know, I wanted to, you know,
I want to look my best for this show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to the barbers yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was ended up getting a fucking Britney
Spears for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've showed up looking like a sperm
whale, but sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I worked in the fashion industry
for a lot of years, which is what inspired
[SPEAKER_03]: me to learn how to make films.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always way more interested in how,
you know, how it was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see what we're doing is we're
repeating this in this angle and then
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it again in this angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can somehow cut it up because up
until that time, I always thought there
[SPEAKER_03]: was some hidden cameras or something like,
how do they do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, back in the day,
I was working with all of these big names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hype Williams was one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shot this commercial in Grand Central
station in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I saw Hype Williams sat there
with his directors cans on and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, telling people what shots he
wanted, I was like, man, that's what I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to, you know, finally go to
film school and I got my degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I graduated, that just so
happened to be the year I broke up with my
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came to New York to cry it,
sorry to America to cry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just fucking never left,
overstayed my visa and then ended up in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the, the trimming world,
the trimmer Grimm world, try to make a
[SPEAKER_03]: buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's how I merged the two,
but the story, you know, it goes deeper
[SPEAKER_03]: than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends in, in Europe that I,
you know, I come from the same town as,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they, they had their own seed game in,
in Europe, but they wanted to,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of things were going on with the,
the postal service in Europe that was
[SPEAKER_03]: making it really hard to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially the UK, especially the UK,
the UK was part of the EU till,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, I think it's even longer
than that, but yeah, it's time flies like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it feels like it was two years
later, probably five years because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: right around COVID time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like 2019, 2020.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, um, because I've always been coming
to America, you know, since I was a little
[SPEAKER_03]: boy and a friend of mine, he's the guy who
had the seed company in England.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it was doing all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but he's always accosting me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I used to, he used to come to my gigs
and he'd be like, Matt, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing this cannabis thing and the word
cannabis in the UK back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even now I'm assuming, I mean,
I've been here for a decade was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, really like, no, I'm not getting
into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not going to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always turned him down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, cuts a 2017 after I've
been working on this farm for a long time
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was following my Instagram and I
was just unabashedly and unashamedly
[SPEAKER_03]: posting weed stuff onto my Instagram,
you know, and people from school would be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Hey, man, it was like, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, no, I'm in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, you know, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, something went down at that
farm that I worked at something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that I'm actually traumatized
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I worked for this guy, the guy who
picked me up when I was trimming and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, I thought he was pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was always something a bit
sketchy about him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the way that he treated his
girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I didn't allow, it didn't sit well
with me the way that he treated his girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't treat it very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anyway, so over, you know,
the months that I was working there,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was guaranteed like, you know,
a certain paycheck growing the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was, I was out there on my own
living in this little 24 shitty,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, RV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very normal situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew a big beard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's, what's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this weird hair pulling condition,
which is why you'll rarely see me with
[SPEAKER_03]: facial hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had it since I was like really
young.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started on my hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, but I had the biggest beard when
I worked up there and I equated that to
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I think I'm actually really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just on my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one was bothering me.
[SPEAKER_03]: No stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, I was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had two hoop houses, uh, 40 feet wide,
240 feet long.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew 600 plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a valley with another 20 plants,
but they were like, you know, a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had an indoor too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was so much work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the hoops, they were light depth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to pull the top on my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was frigging crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you good workout every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I didn't already have it,
but yeah, it was, that was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So going back to my feelings, about this
guy, he, uh, and I won't mention his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't give him the credit, but,
um, yeah, I didn't like the way he treated
[SPEAKER_03]: his girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, this one night we went to the,
uh, the mid state fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was the mid state fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that's a roll balls area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's gotta be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And John Mayo was playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so he, he was living down in that area
and I, and I obviously had to make my way
[SPEAKER_03]: back up to the ranch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get the plants, you know, fed and
watered the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said he'd be there to help me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a couple of friends with me
helping me from the UK.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, next morning, it's like 11,
I've already watered like half of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and he's still not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, gets like two o'clock, still not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this guy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so his girlfriend finally calls me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, Oh, he's not going to show up
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got a DUI last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not, you know, not that having a DUI
is like a, you know, a big sin,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that was just like the last straw for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was sick and tired of always doing
all the work myself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, um, all right, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was just like, you know,
what ticked me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so anyway, a couple of weeks later,
this one night he gets into it with me
[SPEAKER_03]: because, uh, he locked himself out of his
indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I can imagine how upset
you could be like, Oh, my plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was down in the greenhouse, but he,
uh, you know, he's like, Tried to push it
[SPEAKER_03]: on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy takes his shirt off, gets in my
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just spark him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when he comes to, he disappears
and comes back with his gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: He puts his gun to my head and he says
like, say your last words.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like someone, you know, like, you know,
they say your life flashes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before your eyes, like for me,
I just like froze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then his girlfriend like runs and
moves the gun away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives me just enough time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm sat in my Tacoma or his Tacoma
at this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I got into the truck and I just put
it in neutral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I can't find the keys, but I'm on a
very steep hill and the truck just rolls
[SPEAKER_03]: back and I'm rolling away from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I get to my little shade,
20 foot trailer that I was telling you
[SPEAKER_03]: about jump out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm only wearing my sweatpants cause
it was like real hot day that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I run into my trailer, grab my
shotgun, and then I just scarper off into
[SPEAKER_03]: the woods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this guy's like looking for me
and I spent that entire night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like the, the central coast in
the woods all night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little English guy, you know, I know,
I know how to use a gun because I'd spent
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of time shooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, but I hid in the woods for
probably like eight hours until it started
[SPEAKER_03]: to get light, but I could see him,
you know, in his truck looking for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was tripping balls, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one point I could see some houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, uh, I was like, I'm going to head to
those houses and I'm going to knock on the
[SPEAKER_03]: door, not with the shotgun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, I climbed over this fence
and I just woke up like, I don't know how
[SPEAKER_03]: long later, but I guess the fence I tried
to climb over was an electrified deer
[SPEAKER_03]: fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still got the zip across my,
my nipple right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that was my experience growing
weed on the central coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I say I have PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left the farm, never went back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but you know, for a long time
after that, like I'd wake up and I'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: looking around my house for him,
even though it was unrealistic,
[SPEAKER_03]: like he's not going to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone that's still in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if he's in the industry or
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've cut ties with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I will say, I hope he's
doing all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he was obviously like, there's
something going on with him, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trauma is one of those things,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that caused a lot of trauma.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people say, why don't you smoke
some weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, uh, we all have our own body
chemistries and you know, we all respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to trauma differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing works for one person is
especially with cannabinoids and with
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, uh, you know, these
combinations we're going to maybe CBD.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I, you know, that's exactly what
I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still use it to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you smoke before that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I'd say, yeah, I've smoked,
but I've never had a good reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you, I'll tell you for why.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use CBD and they have CBD RSO now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to lift in the gym and I have
the crazy inflammation, especially in my
[SPEAKER_03]: elbows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone recommended this CBD RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's non-psychoactive or it is to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like, it's RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, you know, at the very base level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 2.2 milligrams per.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how ibuprofen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely felt some sort of buzz from
taking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if I had just had like a CBD
isolate or whatever, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I was taking a CBD RSO for,
for months and I felt like it was
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely, definitely helping where the
inflammation was concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the anxiety and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that, but definitely
with the inflammation and the packaging
[SPEAKER_03]: between the THC, the RSO and the CBD RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only difference was the fact that it
said CBD and the fact that it said THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to such a comfort level of
walking into our March and Ash,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was to grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, you know, one day after work,
I just grabbed it, went home and I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember exactly what I ate that night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cooked frigging salmon with hollandaise
and some mashed potatoes and some
[SPEAKER_03]: asparagus for me, my daughter and my wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a couple of beers and had by
this point, I was having half a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it come in a gram pen or syringe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was having half a gram of CBD RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd put it under my tongue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I work out like pretty
competitively and I lift pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really helping.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, this one night took half a gram of
CBD as what I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then had a couple of drinks and went
to bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at four in the morning,
I woke up and I've never felt so strange
[SPEAKER_03]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, why do I feel this way?
[SPEAKER_03]: I could hear my heart like in my head,
in my chest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I sat up and it was like,
time was really slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like being high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, don't forget, like I don't
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do use the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this is like an extreme amount,
you're talking about 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, especially for someone who
has no tolerance, like it's just like an
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, yeah, I mean, traumatizing,
I'm sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll move on to the psychedelics because
I actually do enjoy psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one time I woke up, I said to my
wife, there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I could hear my own voice in my
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was saying, it was, it was like a
psychotic episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was saying, Matt, not that you would,
but you're capable of harming your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what my own voice was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I said to my wife, like, call the
ambulance now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, just, just please call the
ambulance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, then I go in the kitchen and sat there
waiting and this fire truck shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a ring camera too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it caught the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wearing a t-shirt that says
homegrown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, these fucking EMTs show up and I say
to them like, guys, this is going to sound
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly what's happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and I say, I've been taking CBD RSO,
expecting them to know what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could tell like, they're just sort
of laughing it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this is just a guy who's had too
much cookie or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's ate too many edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know exactly what's happened and I'm
trying to explain to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had, I've had too much THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely strong and I've had the
wrong one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I tried to tell them like,
I just want to be away from my family just
[SPEAKER_03]: until this wears off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, eventually like, they say,
are you sure you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: go to the hospital?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they put me in the fire truck,
take me to the hospital and all they end
[SPEAKER_03]: up doing is just putting me in a chair and
it had some restraints in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They strap you down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like that would make it worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They left me in the freaking lobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even give me my own room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sat there for 12 hours,
like Nicholas Cage in fucking One Flew of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because they gave me a sedative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been Xanax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they gave it to me and it did help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm sat there and then, you know,
as the time goes by, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, I think I'm ready to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my eyes were like super red for a
couple of days after.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what Parker Curtis, good friend of
mine, who's going to be on the show told
[SPEAKER_03]: me was you should have had some CBD
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that will... CBD will drop you
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he actually happened to have some.
[SPEAKER_03]: It competes for the receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that these EMTs,
they need to be educated because,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they just gave me a Xani or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had some CBD isolate, maybe the
situation would have been better for me a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't have CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is the Narcan for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the slogan right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should make a Narcan, like cannabis,
so C-A-N-N, Narcan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's actually a good marketing tool
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not that I did indulge in THC anyway,
but I accidentally overdosed on RSO,
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up in hospital, walk outside with a
I Grow Weed t-shirt, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these EMTs are laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most embarrassing experience of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was literally, I was high for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I ate too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had people trimming in my house,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I used to grow plants in the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to trim in the house in the front
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was making edibles for Tray Cool
from Green Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was going on tour and wanted these
really strong edibles, but he didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: them to smell like weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept on adding more to make them as
strong as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kept tasting them, making sure that it was
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, I'm curled up in the
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had eaten way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was tripping and I thought everybody
knew, I thought my neighbors knew that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was high in my, I thought I was going to
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called my wife and I'm like,
I need to go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to take me to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, what, what, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, and I'm like, yeah, I ate too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we, I was making those, it was rice
crispy and not rice crispy as fruity
[SPEAKER_00]: pebble treats at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, I was making the fruity
pebble treats for Tray Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to go to the hospital cause I'm
dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, hangs up the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, you got to write this
out on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call her back and she's like,
you need a man up and like figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not coming home.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was working at the time and she was
working right down the street,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's like, yeah, I'm not coming home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ate weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when she said that at the end
though, it kind of clicked it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah, I'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm looking out the window of
like, fuck, my neighbors know I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, that paranoia that you get from
cannabis is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's a large group of
people out there that haven't had the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of trying a smaller dose of
cannabis where they would enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of this traumatic experience
where they either ate way too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: took a dab or consume way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they never want to do cannabis again
or experience it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first experience and I'm not,
you know, I think I spend all my life with
[SPEAKER_03]: people who love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think cannabis is a frigging
glorious plant provided by mother nature
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's not just for getting high.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if that's, you know, what you use it
for great, but there's so many beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: factors to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I was, I think I was about 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first time I got high because
my brother who's older than me,
[SPEAKER_03]: he started smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brick hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he used to make these things called
bottle bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard of a bottle bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, fucking have a bottle
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd get like a, you get a bottle of
Coke, like a plastic bottle of Coke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably do have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just call it something different here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut it in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a plastic bag, like the corner of a
plastic bag, tape that to the bag and then
[SPEAKER_03]: push the bag into the ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a foil cap, put some holes into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this isn't a lesson for, uh,
what's it called paraphernalia,
[SPEAKER_03]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your, you've got your ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've cut it in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've taped a bag around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've stuffed the bag up, up into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a foil cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You stab it a few times with a pin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sprinkle your hash on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You burn it and you draw it with the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you pull the bag down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's full, you take the thing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we used to use Coke cans,
but I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully understand how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done that, but yeah,
I mean, that's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I never, like, it was the worst
experience of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, that was under the
influence of my brother, the crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: bastard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my first experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much older was your brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years, two years older than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have gotten that wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I was 12 and he was 14 or I was 10
and he was 12 either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, it's no, you know,
it's no, uh, activity for a 10 or a 12
[SPEAKER_03]: year old, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I started, I started
smoking when I was 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that's, I'm not going to
say it's a good age, but it was the age
[SPEAKER_00]: where I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think high school, high school,
a lot of kids are introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of those kids at chewing
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried chewing tobacco when I was seven,
threw up all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so good though to experience it
when I was seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I was like 14 and everyone's
like, let's try chewing tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you guys try chewing tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw all my friends get sick lying on
the ground, throwing up drooling and
[SPEAKER_00]: spitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was never going to chew like
because of that experience when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, I'm sure part of it was from
that 10 year old or 12 year old experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically turned you away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I should just start small on the
Zins or something and work my way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you there's probably something
that's right for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like white thorn rose is feel
good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like white thorn rose,
you need to look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't have any right now,
but I can probably get you some,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it's about starting small and
just, you know, I think that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some profile that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: If CBD works for you, that means that
there's probably something else that works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's also about like exploring
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle's always saying to me, you know,
exactly what you're saying right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, it's just that you haven't found
the right cultivar or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're smoking too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm totally open to it,
but, you know, I've been around,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been around the block and,
you know, I've had, I've struggled with
[SPEAKER_03]: addiction, just not cannabis, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol, you're English.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got another beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drinking is, yeah, that's a part of my
heritage, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drink warm beer too.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not, that's a freaking
stereotype dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually warm beer in the Caribbean is
they do, they drink Guinness warm and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have extra bitter Guinness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to work at a pub in London.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we used to pour the, it was like,
um, there are some beers that you drink
[SPEAKER_03]: warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes right out of the barrel and you
just pump it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you drink warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's like an old man's drink,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't, you wouldn't catch me dead
drinking a warm beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stella, how about IPAs?
[SPEAKER_00]: IPAs are like the cannabis of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: IPAs an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate the taste of it,
but I keep drinking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're terpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the story behind IPAs is they were
shipping it across from the Europe or the
[SPEAKER_03]: UK to America, but they used to load it
full of hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: To keep it, I don't know, fresh or to keep
it from spoiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how it originated, but it's by
no means, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's by no means like a, it's an
American beverage for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it originated going from
England to India or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've evolved it into something
completely different than what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've, you've done so much with IPAs
and it's just, it's an American drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in the, in the nineties,
IPAs evolved into so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these specific hops that they use
and the combinations of hops are really
[SPEAKER_00]: dank and very much like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely ties to the,
the beer world and the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's similarities with beer and
cannabis, especially with the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: going online and these big companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, we have in alcohol,
there's, you know, the big four or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the craft breweries and
the craft breweries have kind of taken
[SPEAKER_00]: over where it's almost the exact opposite
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have these big companies coming
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's the fear of the craft
going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people that have the best
flower are always going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also am big fans of people that make
their own beer and grow their own weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Cushman, great example of somebody
who is a home grower who loves weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow plants no matter what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we've been pushing for,
you know, since I met Kyle, like eight
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago, we've been pushing out grow
your own content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys have your own channel and
it's very successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've, you know, we've curated
over the years and, you know, collaborated
[SPEAKER_03]: with, I think more recently the podcast,
I think we're in a podcast boom,
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people just fricking love podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, yeah, I think that's
something that we've been able to utilize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, we'd spend,
you know, a lot of time and money and
[SPEAKER_03]: making a cinematic piece of content that
would get barely any engagement if you
[SPEAKER_03]: compared it to just two people sitting
across a table talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding or synthetic versus organic or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the best podcasts,
in my opinion, are the conversations that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have between each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just really casual conversations
where you get to know somebody like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that's our, our, you know,
and Joe Rogan kind of started it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in, in that form, Kyle was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been there forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched a, I watched a clip the other
day about how Joe Rogan got the
[SPEAKER_03]: inspiration for his podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was from Tom Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Green was, you know, just had his
little show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Tom Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freddy got a finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like some sausage?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great movie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tom Green had, you know, a really young
fear factor, Joe Rogan on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Joe Rogan's like, what the fuck is
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, people like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're just here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Joe Rogan was like, huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then before you know it, Joe Rogan's
got his own show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his evolved relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he loves doing podcasts because he
does these long podcasts, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our formats, you know,
it's an hour, hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours max.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this guy called?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is it like Jamie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pull that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Jamie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you've got one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's called Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking love Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan's behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan's alleged.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, this is a good point
to pivot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm here with Rick DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of Ryan, I was, I was working
on like producing, yeah, I was in very
[SPEAKER_03]: early stages of pre-production on an idea
for a film that I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent it to Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, I like, I like,
you know, he's, he's very well versed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very passionate in what he does.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met him on your show when I came
here with Dawn and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, Hey, yeah, I'm,
you know, I'm, I'm trying to produce this
[SPEAKER_03]: film and I've got this person involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: That person involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you know, he should make a
movie about, and I'm like, who?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, Richard DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Richard DeLisi, eh?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I watched the episode that Rich did
with, with Rick on, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it screamed like blow, you know,
with Johnny Depp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very, his story is very
authentic and very much like blow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so because of Ryan, who produces this
show, because he said I should do a film
[SPEAKER_03]: about Richard DeLisi, I was like,
all right, let me, let me do some deep
[SPEAKER_03]: diving and some deep diving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just fascinated by, you know,
his story also very aligned with the
[SPEAKER_03]: social justice aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've been in the cannabis industry
for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we watch, we watch Uncle
Sam with tax revenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your silent partner, Uncle Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every, every year, so many billions and
there's still people rotting in jail for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in some states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even have some presidents that are
partnering with their sons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have all these people in prison
and I just, I just don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, I did a deep dive and I was
just fascinated and even the project that
[SPEAKER_03]: I was already working on and I,
you know, I've, one of my mentors in film
[SPEAKER_03]: school is called Terry McDonough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's a big director in TV and film,
Breaking Bad directed a bunch of episodes
[SPEAKER_03]: of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He directed, uh, Better Call Saul,
The Expanse.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a big, big director.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was one of the people I was,
I was producing this project, but you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, under the, um, the watchful eye of
Terry, you know, any idea I had,
[SPEAKER_03]: he would give me feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said to Terry, Hey, uh, what do you
think of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like showed him, who Richard DeLisi was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, this is a, you know,
it's got all the hallmarks of something
[SPEAKER_03]: really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd never met Rick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never met Richard, but I did have a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, up until that point,
our podcast was doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that, that reminds me of something
quite funny that happened with you in
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona when we had you on the podcast
and you've got this massive fucking trophy
[SPEAKER_03]: on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kyle goes, Oh, so what's this trophy
for?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, best podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm coming for you next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love a bit of healthy competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I, that event was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The international cannabis awards where we
got first place, got that, that trophy
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it looks bigger in real life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sergio, the guy who, um, it's the very
first one, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I used to work for Sergio many
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a really good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, we just saw him in Vegas as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, um, he's, he's one of the guys I
used to work for back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think we will be answering the
ICA best podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm excited for everybody and I'm
one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't have a big ego with this
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that when we interviewed you for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're about keeping legends
alive, you know, before they, I'm about
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they give me this award.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't expecting an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy that we got it, but I'm just
so happy to be part of a bigger community
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, have a good team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like, I come from a
world where it's all about loyalty and
[SPEAKER_00]: about friendship and about winning and
losing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's so good when you have a team
that when you suffer, we all suffer when
[SPEAKER_00]: we win, we all win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, we've had good times this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had bad times this year,
but we got a solid team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and not just the podcast team,
cause these guys have had to suffer with
[SPEAKER_00]: me too, or we've suffered and,
but like my cultivation partners,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have amazing cultivation partners and
partners all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this, this group,
a lot of us started in the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even you started in, you know,
the gray black market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so coming and transitioning to
this, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact that people aren't going
to prison as much for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love having Rick DeLisi and Lou
Scarmazzo and, and you know, both uncle
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick and his son, who I met 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things he told me is my
pops is in prison and we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to see him out, you know,
he, he had a 96 years prison sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: 96 served 32, 98 served 32 and served 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's a lot of
blessings that we've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in our life and, you know,
and just, I feel like it's a blessing
[SPEAKER_00]: every day to be able to wake up and get to
do this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when you asked me earlier,
so how did you transition from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, making films and being in
cannabis or vice versa?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where it started with my friend
in the UK who had a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally was like, you know,
after what happened to me on the farm with
[SPEAKER_03]: the gun and the night in the woods and
getting shocked by the electric deer
[SPEAKER_03]: fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really crazy dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you know, not divulging too
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was already predisposed to frigging
drugs and I spent the last year being so
[SPEAKER_03]: happy growing a beard, like I told you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I fell right back off that wagon
and I was, I was in a bad way for quite a
[SPEAKER_03]: while until I decided, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to do something or I'm going back to
England.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I took the phone call.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my boys come over from the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually Sergio ended up being part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used all of the connections that I'd
made as a grower on the central coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: introduced him to whoever I knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that company turned into
Homegrown Cannabis Co, which is what,
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what I do for Homegrown Cannabis
Co is I curate the education.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the irony is the guy who put the gun
to my head, he used to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me about all of his idols and all of
his idols were like DNA Genetics and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Berner, who I'm going to be
interviewing tomorrow for our film with
[SPEAKER_03]: Richard DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these people, that he idolized and
at that time I really had little knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked with, I've literally worked
with every single one of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's Jorge Cervantes or Ed
Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit of Schadenfreude
there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you know, fuck you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, drinks to that one.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DNA, Don and Aaron, great people,
really good friends of both of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we probably wouldn't be here sitting
today if you hadn't come in the door then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're probably right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, some of the best guys in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was just trying to break
into the industry, those guys were already
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge success, you know, and then Kyle
Cushman and you've been working with Kyle
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's an, you know, he's, he's an
eccentric character.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's a wild man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loves that strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of our business model when we started
the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was how do we separate ourselves from just
a seed bank to, you know, something that
[SPEAKER_03]: offers more than just seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where Kyle came into play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sergio, he had his own channel at the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was called 420 TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he knew, he knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he introduced me to Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made my first film with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Kyle was integral in that business
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause what we wanted to do is we wanted to
create cannabis growing content.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't just your average grower,
but someone who was dedicated a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time and had a certain
repertoire and cannabis teaching you how
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we wanted to give that away to our
customers for free, you know, in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: invite them into our ecosystem and our
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what Kyle and I have been doing
for all those years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we've ended up making
content with pretty much, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of people still out there
that I'd love to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, yeah, it's like,
if you go to our channel on Homegrown,
[SPEAKER_03]: youtube.com forward slash Homegrown
Cannabis Co.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the content that we've
curated for the last decade is all
[SPEAKER_03]: available there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All really well laid out and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this preconceived notion in
cannabis that if you don't, if you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: get high, you shouldn't be in the industry
or I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you agree with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: no, you know, I, I do have feelings about
it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I do have some of the best
girls I know don't smoke, but I also am
[SPEAKER_00]: the one who's test their flower for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give me samples and I'm like,
oh yeah, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's a really tough thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everyone has their place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to hate on people that don't
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just tough doing business with people
that don't have that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at it just, just money a lot
of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a devotional thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The full, the full embodiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a, as a camera person or somebody
like, uh, our producer Ryan has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through periods where he doesn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have any negative feelings
about that at all, because I respect him
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's found his place, uh,
with us in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's okay for me, but as a
cultivator, I'm like, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of cultivators who don't
smoke and they do fine, but it's a tough
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I'm saying is, um,
it's like a YouTube much of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: To smoke weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I almost feel compelled to
rebuttal, which, but I shouldn't,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's like, I've tried drugs that you
probably haven't even fucking heard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we're all, we're all human
and yeah, I don't, I don't smoke weed
[SPEAKER_03]: because I just don't like how it makes me
react.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't not smoke it because I'm afraid of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I also do use the plant for what
it's there for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's there for many things,
you know, like my story earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: which, you know, unfortunately it was one
of the most embarrassing things that's
[SPEAKER_03]: happened to me in my life, but I still use
CBD RSO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I still use full spectrum CBD
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I do feel like they help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've, you know, I've got a lot of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still consuming the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely still consuming the
plant, whether it's CBD or THC or any
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoid, there's CBN that people
take for sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's not all, I mean,
the plant has so many uses, whether,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people build houses with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has so much potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rope and clothes and all these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you spoke to a friend of mine,
Jaco, you might even know, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve D'Angelo's, um, I used to work with
Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what his position was,
but yeah, he, he used to speak to me a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: about hemp and how it can save the world
because there's so many kind of hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic, like anything hemp can literally,
but you know, hemp would beat big ag or
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, big farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would just beat so many,
uh, conglomerates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Textiles, the whole textile industry could
get taken over with hemp, which I would,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think would make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a better material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot stronger, lasts a lot longer,
but that's also the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to make money and you
only have to sell someone a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirts that last the rest of your life,
there goes capitalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bunch of hemp.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, like, like, like we were
talking about, I, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I started out back in the day,
uh, working as a fashion model between
[SPEAKER_00]: London, New York, like catwalks and stuff,
all that stuff.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, yeah, I did, I did coworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've walked Kelvin Klein,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my best friend growing up was a
fashion model and he flew all over Italy,
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, you know, was very successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the days, you know,
when, uh, I think that was my gateway into
[SPEAKER_03]: hardcore fucking drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, real drugs, man drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I'm not making light of it or
maybe I am, but that was an affliction for
[SPEAKER_03]: many years of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually only stopped really fucking
around with, uh, hardcore drugs when my
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter, my daughter was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, that was what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took for me to, you know, take a step
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I just basically, uh, drink all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I just drink, you know, uh,
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, like the, the psychoactive
nature of cannabis, not for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not saying that it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it seems to be for most people,
but well, at least you're going in the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you like mushrooms and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hillbilly is my favorite cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's less of the, from my experience,
you know, I've had penis envies before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like, I don't like P E's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they're way too psychoactive for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a different kind of psychoactive,
different kind of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, I'm still,
I like golden teachers, golden teachers
[SPEAKER_00]: are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Magnolias, they have blue Magnolias.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your experience from hillbillies?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know if it's similar to mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I feel like it's uplifting and
energetic and I feel very good on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I like about, uh,
golden teachers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I mean, golden teachers,
like the entry level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like that they're not super
introspective and I'm not going,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I like introspective suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the problem with any
psychedelic that's introspective for me is
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of demons and I don't like
being in my own head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good to go in your head
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a purge, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a purge aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a necessary purge that you
need to do every once in a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have all these filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think who you are now and how you
see the world is from all the experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those experiences puts filter
over your eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how you see the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not necessarily the world really
is that's your perception of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have different lenses based on
these experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it takes a deep dive into
psychedelics or, you know, cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: they tune you in and make you see how the
world really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you need to get out of that
perspective to understand that you're an
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole because you do this, this and
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And psychedelics isn't the perfect cure
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I'm able to look at the world
through a different lens and I'm able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of see the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess it's all perception
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all, you know, your own personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like I'm less of an asshole
when I do psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see how we're all tied in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start seeing that there's this
interconnected balance between everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: every living thing that exists,
you start realizing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you shouldn't be hating so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like that side of the
psychedelic experience, whereas like you
[SPEAKER_00]: get so much more tuned in with cannabis,
tuned in with psychedelics, whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and some of these other drugs tune
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I feel like, you know,
you go to a Grateful Dead show back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, now Dead and Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people with alcohol
and you can tell which ones are tuned in
[SPEAKER_00]: and which ones are tuned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just kind of goes across the board,
but I feel like they can both exist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, alcohol can be something where you
relax a little bit and that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I think alcohol does a lot
more damage to people than it does good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll still keep drinking alcohol,
but you know, in spite of knowing that and
[SPEAKER_03]: in spite of knowing that, you know,
there's things out there that's way
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, us humans are doing our damnedest to
try to kill ourselves every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like cannabis helps a little
bit going in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, yeah, we might be smoking and
all these things, but we become more
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious of the things around us,
you know, like cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a sucker for a cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make the best cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally I do Smashburgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do, I do big half pound burgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they just like pound a piece of meat
until it's just dust?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do is you have a griddle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a hot griddle plancha that you
heat up and you get it really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take your patty that has to
be 70% lean or less, and you smash it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a, with basically iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cast iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it's round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cast iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smashed the burger with a piece of
parchment paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it real thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is it adheres to the
plancha and then you actually scrape it
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get this thick crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you do is you put some onions and
salt and pepper before you flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the onions start to cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you flip it over, it grills the
onions a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put your cheese on there and it's done
in like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at this point in the show,
when you look at the analytics,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is when the drop off is, cause all
the stoners are going to the kitchen to
[SPEAKER_03]: make a burger with the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny cause like, I think a lot
of there's a trans, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from cooking to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a lot of hard work and you're
creating an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the ones that are creating amazing
products, you know, they understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a lot of hard work and it's all
the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we can have amazing meat,
but if the buns shit, the fucking burger
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have, I like brioche,
but there's like good potato buns and
[SPEAKER_00]: other buns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it's also trial and error R and D
like, but yeah, as far as the tie in with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cooking and cannabis,
they really marry well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at some of the top breeders in
the world, guys in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them have experienced either
cooking, they either love cooking or they
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about Ariane or Oskam,
Shored Brooks, I can name a million other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, but like a lot of good friends of
mine that are in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely transitioned from cooking at
some point in their life and understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and flavor profiles and combining
flavors, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just such a great way to transition
into cannabis because you understand on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different level where it's not like,
oh, it's just good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, it's good weed and it has
these layers of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's these, these notes on the
front and notes on the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has this long finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you can start talking about
cannabis like that, you know, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding not only cannabis,
but everything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it transitions to everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should start having, uh, you know,
the growers wearing chef's hats now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of just the lab cloaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty sanitary too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you imagine guys with those big tall
hats?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can barely get into the door,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a transferable skill,
no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and these are lifelong skills,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand farming and agriculture,
you can go anywhere in the world with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with cooking, same thing with
nursing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of careers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you can transition if it
doesn't matter where you go in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to grow, you can probably
get a job growing somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can cook really well, you can go do
that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nursing, obviously you can go to make
money pretty much anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, um, I remember Swami,
when we did a series with him,
[SPEAKER_03]: he said something along the lines of,
uh, once you learn how to grow cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you learn how to grow, which is like,
you know, that's just suggesting that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's not just cannabis,
you've learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a world where you need to grow your
own fruits and veggies, all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: principles of growing the fundamentals,
they're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there's a lot of places that are
importing produce from the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: and other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, they could be more
self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working down in the Caribbean St.
Vincent with the government down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we imported 30,000 seeds and came up
with a breeding plan and an economic plan
[SPEAKER_00]: to help out the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, the actual local
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's, it, it has a lot of
potential, you know, all these things look
[SPEAKER_00]: great on paper, but seeing them executed
over time, that's really what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm interested in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what varieties of mine grow well
in the Caribbean, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like from a breeding perspective,
then we can really start changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think with genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, um, last time I was here a
couple of months ago, um, you showed me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know how much you can talk
about it cause it might still be under
[SPEAKER_03]: wraps, but you were talking about some
real like analytical, uh, data research
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that you're doing to learn how each
cultivar responds to each.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically we're a hub here and
we're collecting all this data right on
[SPEAKER_00]: these cultivars, but collecting it indoors
and you can get some really important
[SPEAKER_00]: information for other people that are
growing indoors with your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we can go take that same thing
and we can have germ plasm sent all around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world to these different climates and
actually start collecting data from how
[SPEAKER_00]: they perform in different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you have enough of them,
you can compare and get really useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information, especially for breeding,
especially long-term and then creating you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, cultivars that perform optimally in
those different climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really that's what we're chasing
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what land race genetics typically
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think there's a confusion on what
land race genetics are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people think land race or
something that grow in the wild,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're feral and that's just not
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land race or genetics that have been bred
for a specific purpose in certain places
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't necessarily have to be
indigenous to that region, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: bred for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically they're optimal for that,
that purpose or reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to get on that bandwagon and
so start optimizing genetics for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's what the world
needs is more optimization with cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that's the beauty of this plant is
there's so many different uses,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the drug side of it, where we can
look at the, you know, the hemp side of it
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as industrial hemp, uh,
manufacturing for textiles, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, you know, they're so, yeah,
hemp seeds are extremely valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you so elaborate on the land race
aspect with what you talked about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I remember Ed Rosenthal was telling me
that he wants to go to Jamaica to find a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way I interpreted that was a
cultivar that was innate to Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_03]: but is that not the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so it's multiple generations land
race that they've, they've basically bred
[SPEAKER_00]: that through multiple generations for
specific use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the thing is, is these genetics,
these varieties are dictated by climate
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're manipulated from over
time by the climate, by the nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the basically by the environment and
nutrition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the phenotype that,
that expresses, we have a genotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's basically the genotype is the DNA
that's locked within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't change, but phenotypical
expression gets changed by environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can have, um, the same cultivar
and, um, I mean, I might sound real novice
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, which I shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for 10 years,
but I've only been, you know, making the
[SPEAKER_03]: films, but I do try and educate myself a
lot, but I've seen the same cultivar,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one of them is so purple and the other
one is not.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be the same exact plant,
the same genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's grown in Costa Rica and grown in
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't even look like the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smoke the same taste,
the same have the same structure because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's influenced by its environment around
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how about temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've heard like temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, yeah, you see the purples when
it's, uh, you know, cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These anthocyanins in the plant,
uh, that make the plant purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in colder climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are just naturally purple and
no matter how hot it is or cold it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will, they will be purple,
but a lot of things are influenced by
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cold nighttime temperatures or cold
temperatures in general, they'll purple
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then that can also change the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's specific flavors when
people say it tastes purple, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about the floral
characteristics a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that you get with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, yeah, there's people that talk
about it tasting like a color and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a color association with a flavor with
cannabis and it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's, um, you know, if anyone was
tuning into this episode to learn anything
[SPEAKER_03]: about weed, that was your five minutes
right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of it's just anecdotal film shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, we were talking about
transferable skills chef to breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, filmmaker to cannabis
content creator, and there's a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect of knowledge that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've learned a lot about cannabis
from filming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met Eric Nug shots for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big, I'm a big fan of his.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a badass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can tell, you know, you can tell
that that guy is very well versed in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, in cannabis and cultivation
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there's a whole side of it to
like, there's guys, I mean, we've
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced it with guys coming in with
photography skills where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I need you to shoot this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, dude, those seeds look like
garbage, but you have to educate somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: on same thing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and what I love about cannabis
photography so much is as, as a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a cultivator, someone who's been
working with the plant for so long,
[SPEAKER_00]: when these guys pick the plants,
they've done some amazing stuff with DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, the spinning photos and the
stuff, it has to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is if you have tips of
your leaves that are burnt, or if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: flaws, it's there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, especially with these high
definition photos, like everything stands
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pick the perfect cola at
the perfect time and have it still alive
[SPEAKER_00]: and happy when you shoot the photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Todd McCormick who taught me all
about, I was completely nervous about
[SPEAKER_03]: layering, about photo stacking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we went to stay with him for a couple
of days and I was like, so Todd,
[SPEAKER_03]: why is your camera on this slider then?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you have to go out of the room when
you start?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been over there and seen his stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: He taught me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was doing that more than 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, he's been doing it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I remember him doing some
photos for us a long time, 2012 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, technology has gotten so
advanced now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even the new iPhones for
photography for cannabis is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: phones are better than the cameras that we
used to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the video cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been implementing my phone into,
you know, my workflow.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember- We film this show on
iPhones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't tell you if you did,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to, um, there was an anecdotal
story I wanted to talk about just because
[SPEAKER_03]: it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be incriminating for Ricky Williams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will, um, disclaim it first,
but one of my favorite, um, memories of
[SPEAKER_03]: making a piece of content was with Ricky
Williams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, at the time being a Brit, didn't know
who he was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my colleagues did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh my gosh, this is a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Ricky's going to come and do some
stuff for homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a stoner too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's totally into astrology and,
um, smoking weed, learning about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so he came to my house in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, as hospitable as,
you know, I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all, that's all I could offer Ricky
Williams.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't know who Ricky was,
but what a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, we spent the day interviewing
him at my house and, um, I wanted some
[SPEAKER_03]: props.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, we need, you know,
something to contextualize this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's pull some plants from the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Parker, he's our head grower over at
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he had a garden full of, uh,
plants out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't flowering at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but they were, you know, pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Parker, like we need, we need a
few plants for the set.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we rented a U-Haul and we filled it
with probably like 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they're in, um, 25 gallon
pots, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they were, they were going to be big
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd just been transplanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we filled up the U-Haul with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we dressed my, we went into
my yard and we dressed the set with these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and it looked pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then we interviewed Ricky and I
was like, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done the interview, but I really
want to get some B-roll, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: contextualize the interview, get some of
you smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can we do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ricky was like, well, you know,
I grew up here in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, I actually didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also didn't know that you played
football until like 20 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've, you know, I mean, I wouldn't say
Ricky and I were like chums, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we bumped into each other, we'd know
who one another are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I went to Patrick Henry High
School, which is in San Diego and they've
[SPEAKER_03]: got a field there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was like, well, why don't we go
there and we'll, um, we'll film you
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing some balls and walking up and
down and carrying on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll meet you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, he off, he went on his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I thought I'd killed two birds
with one stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, so what we'll do is we'll load
all these plants into the U-Haul.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll drive to Patrick Henry High,
which is a fucking high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll do the bit with Ricky and then
we'll get back in U-Haul and we'll take
[SPEAKER_03]: them back to the garden and put them where
they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the school was closed too,
but Ricky was like, ah, we'll just hop the
[SPEAKER_03]: fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, of course we went,
we went and did all of the cool shit with
[SPEAKER_03]: Ricky film.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, breaking the law with Ricky
Williams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he, he wasn't breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I have to disclaim it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had no knowledge that Parker and I
showed up to the school with a truck
[SPEAKER_03]: filled with weed plants, like a high
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he had absolutely no knowledge of
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I didn't even deny, I didn't even
think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it like that in that context.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I got back, I was like,
dude, did we go to a high school with a
[SPEAKER_03]: truck filled with weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and Parker was like, yeah,
we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my fondest memories of,
you know, making some content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like not incriminating to
Ricky Oll.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of all the adventures that you've
had, what was the best one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just tell us one of the top ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be, it could be going to Bogota
with DNA, with Don, Aaron and Rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we stayed in this farmhouse,
which was like, honestly, when we got
[SPEAKER_03]: there, I don't think it had been touched
since like, no, the Narcos were running
[SPEAKER_03]: the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, they said it was a stash
house that Don and Aaron and Rez did.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tour guide did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, it feels like it,
you know, so I spent all night like
[SPEAKER_03]: playing poker.
[SPEAKER_03]: With Don and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went to all of these farms the
next day and we made this really cool
[SPEAKER_03]: video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, that was a really good memory of
mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know what to think of,
of Don and Aaron, because we hadn't spent
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of time together, but you know,
those guys are just the most humble like
[SPEAKER_03]: him, Don, Rez guys ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do these guys do coke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they not do coke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turns out that they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was in safe hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, um, yeah, you know, we went to
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do any cocaine and we did a
really good job of the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was probably one of my best memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't partake down there,
but you know, my younger self may have
[SPEAKER_00]: been disappointed a little bit,
but you know, it's like, I'm an adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was speaking to MJ Biz too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I did have an amazing adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bogota is one of the most beautiful
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the biggest city I think I've
ever been to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that hospital?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hospital.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is half built.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and it's been there since like the
eighties and it was actually being built
[SPEAKER_03]: by the Narcos as a Narco hospital.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the government obviously
infiltrated the Narcos ended that era.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hospital is still there,
half built off the side of the freeway.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did not see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some videos of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the cheapest Uber I've ever
taken for the distance that I've gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so wild how cheap Uber is over
there, but then you have to sit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: front seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if it's still like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there in 2019 and, uh, yeah,
you have to sit in the front seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the driver and if they pull you over,
you have to tell them that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you had to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to sit in the front seat,
but I also had to give the driver a hand
[SPEAKER_03]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you had to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in Cali as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cali is, I mean, it's just so
beautiful and the food is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like I was taking care of,
you know, they just really took care of me
[SPEAKER_00]: and all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a bodyguard when I was there in
Cali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cali, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must've watched like Narcos right
before you went.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, yeah, I definitely need a
bodyguard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me that, you know, everywhere I
went, he was with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there's in Cali,
there's, uh, you know, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's basically, uh, checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you got to stop at the checkpoints
and they show them the information you get
[SPEAKER_00]: sent through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was, yeah, they took really good
care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, really, really, really good
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely remember the food too,
which is also what contributes to one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the, you know, being one of my favorite
memories of, you know, making content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been out here to Oakland a bunch of
times too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's more dangerous in Oakland than it
is in Columbia, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I would have to agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not that I've experienced danger
in either, but yeah, if I had to feel safe
[SPEAKER_03]: in either of them, I'd say, uh,
Columbia, but yeah, tomorrow, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: as per the movie that we're producing,
Santa Marta Gold, um, for Richard DeLisi
[SPEAKER_03]: and in light of all the social justice,
um, issues that are going on in Cali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to go and be graced by Berner.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to do a little spot for us,
talk about his opinion on the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody wants to follow what's
going on, follow Santa Marta, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: film on Instagram, or you can go on
santamarta.gold, which is the website.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you can follow us on
homegrowncannabisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: When's your expected time of, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, of release for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really like, it's almost like
preliminary still.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're doing right now is we're sort
of cultivating, um, the interviews cause
[SPEAKER_03]: we have all of the resources already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, at homegrown, we have our
own production arm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the cameras, we have the
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it's convenient to anybody to
that, you know, that wants to participate
[SPEAKER_03]: in the film, we'll work around their
schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go and interview them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it does come to time to tie
the whole thing together and we've got the
[SPEAKER_03]: budget for that, then, um, we'll have more
of an idea on when it's ready to be
[SPEAKER_03]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, uh, uncle Rick is in one of our
documentaries that we've been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: with Steve D'Angelo for the last six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just filmed when we can and
we've taken long breaks in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky enough to, you know,
review some of it already for Ryan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's coming along really nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's a lot of good
content and, uh, these, these projects are
[SPEAKER_00]: just so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, you know, I really
enjoy the podcast and being able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the stories, but it's guys like Rick and
Luke Scaramazzo and Steve D'Angelo,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, who's, you know, it's funny cause
Steve has gotten a little bit of hate
[SPEAKER_00]: lately and Steve is just a great guy and
he's a pioneer in his own right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be with him tomorrow too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew and Steve, it's like, I've become
really good friends with them over the
[SPEAKER_00]: past few years, especially, um,
but yeah, they're guys I looked up to when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew has the most fascinating hemp shoes
that have this weird mushroom trippy like
[SPEAKER_03]: aesthetic to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the most amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so well spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, so as far as energy and
learning how to talk on camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew has given me the best pointers.
[SPEAKER_00]: His experience with film as an actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, when I have questions about
stuff, about film or opinions,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's always got an opinion and it's always
something positive.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good, good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's been the beauty of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filmed over 90 episodes now and it's
like, I've learned so much from my guests
[SPEAKER_00]: and gotten so much insight on different
things that I never would have thought in
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning that I, you know,
cause I did a podcast during COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when it all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did 43 episodes on the future cannabis
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the James loud show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a lot of insight from people had
scientists on there, but it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, so it's more about the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm able to get these, I feel like
almost puzzle pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're another piece of the puzzle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to get added to the big puzzle.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have, we should have put James,
your producer on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, James, your Ryan, your producer on
the show too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, we've had our escapades
together too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, that guy's super passionate
about what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done podcasts together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done a few lives with us and you
know, he's, he's great and he's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fun and, you know, but there are all these
pieces to the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're telling this bigger story and,
and Kyle is, you know, his, he's doing his
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the good pizza podcast,
you know, and there's a lot, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of good ones out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good pizza, hot dabs has their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, and everybody has
their own side of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like looking back 50 years from
now, I'm not going to be around in 50
[SPEAKER_00]: years more than likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know, but more than likely,
I'm not going to be around in 50 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll be able to see the stories of
all these great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we're just contributing to
the bigger community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people are going to need to
hear stories about why the world was so
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up right now, you know,
and how cannabis saved it and how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: saved it or directly from the mouths of
the people that live those stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than saying this person did this in
a history book that we've had forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like now we have a real
intricate and detailed timeline of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that went on directly from the
people's mouths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that too, especially about your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you saying it on mine,
you know, keeping the legends alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be around forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've contributed so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we've got to get that documented
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, you know, it's been,
it's been turned into, for the longest
[SPEAKER_00]: time, it was demonized, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think being able to share these
stories, how it actually makes the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a beautiful thing to be part of
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm proud to be part of that
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the most unlikely of circumstances,
coming from a country where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: completely contraband, where the word
would be like, Hey, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could be in jail for, you know,
just, I can't even explain how,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the contrast between how it is
in America to how it is in Europe and the
[SPEAKER_03]: UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even how it still is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's changing slowly, but surely
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have medical there yet or not
yet, but they're going to, they will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I think I've heard in some
circumstances, you know, maybe like in a
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlotte's web sort of like dire
circumstances possible, but otherwise no.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, in the most unlikeliest of
circumstances, I did not see my career
[SPEAKER_03]: unfolding down this avenue, but I'm very,
very happy it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really happy to be a part of this
community and create content and to have
[SPEAKER_03]: it received by the people that watch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those people are extremely grateful
and yeah, it's very, very fulfilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now looking back, if you had one piece
of advice for your younger self before
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole thing, where you got involved
with cannabis, where he was coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, what would you tell him?
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd probably be, don't do drugs and stick
with the plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are interested in finding out
more about Nate or Matt Hammer,
[SPEAKER_00]: where can they go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make a disclaimer real quick too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything I said under the guise of Nate
Hammer and Matt Hammer was not factual.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was false just in case immigration in
here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the question again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can people find me?
