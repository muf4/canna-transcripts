[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, our special guests are Mike and
Rick from Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about it for a minute,
so this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year, we were at the DNS event.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought the food and seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys were there giving out soil
and showing love to all the customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, the people that frequent
there are a really amazing, diverse slice
[SPEAKER_02]: of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was such a great event.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a piece of the Bay Area,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys that go there, especially the
home growers that still go there,
[SPEAKER_05]: where there's a lot of them that haven't
started buying on the internet,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're all part of the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to support Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: My community is the best I can in giving
people seeds and sharing seeds and
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're doing a book signing there on
Friday of next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one thing that unites us is
that support for the community,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people at home, growers all over the
world, people wanting to elevate the game
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what brings us together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And support in the stores is huge,
too, just because we know that this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is quite the roller coaster ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're basing your business like a
retail store, going on that ride year to
[SPEAKER_00]: year, that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be there and make sure that they
know that we still care about them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're thinking about them, we're going to
go there, we're going to do our pop-up
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, talk to their customers,
bring swag and samples for their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's keeping the wheels spinning here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I buy my Royal Gold from,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, from Matt over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a big fan of Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been using Royal Gold for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy Joe and my buddy Josh,
Josh Freeman, you guys might know Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, big respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silverback Josh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's been on the show briefly and we
get another one coming up with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so Royal Gold with the age old,
that was the secret mix, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a long time, ace in the hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want good weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the ticket, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so basic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people don't even believe that
it's good because it's so basic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, no, you've got good soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got good food.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a perfect marriage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get I mean, just those two
elements alone, you're going to get good
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simplicity is the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of times get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we visit facilities for our
podcast, Royal Grown Radio, we go through
[SPEAKER_02]: tons of facilities all over and for Royal
Gold touring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the people that are doing the
craziest things are usually having the
[SPEAKER_02]: most problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who are simple, streamlined,
straight and efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the people who are smashing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like vital and I like Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kings makes is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like it's a classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I actually planted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some bags of Kings makes of the
house and I actually planted some cat piss
[SPEAKER_05]: crosses that a guy named Rich gave me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Return of the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he brought some plants by.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put them in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do them in the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't bring soil in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's only cocoa and rock wool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the nursery model going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pheno hunting, but we try to keep it
clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want bugs in the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it makes it difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love growing in soil, but I also love
cocoa and rock wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's the hallmark of what
we do is starting with the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kings makes has really taken off for
us last, you know, three or four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're working on seven or eight,
but yeah, the last three or four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: it definitely seems to have made its way
finally into a lot of growers facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's, you know, in their
greenhouse and pulling their light debt or
[SPEAKER_00]: even in their indoor, if they want a
little less maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're finally there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like seeing it this year,
especially where our Kings McSails are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing fantastic, fantastic rebounding from
the years where everybody kind of felt
[SPEAKER_00]: that low.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's been, it's been
exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then COVID years were good for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID years were good, but an ultimate
challenge in trying to keep up,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to, you know, punch above your
weight class and create more soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had more demand than we'd ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to keep up and give
everybody what they needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it stopped, it just dried up
all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when everybody was feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, it gave us some really unique
challenges, which have helped us grow
[SPEAKER_02]: immensely as a company, as a team,
as a brand, and allowed us to improve our
[SPEAKER_02]: products, improve our material flow and
improve our quality control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a blessing and a curse.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some struggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We felt like we lost millions of dollars
in sales that we just couldn't make enough
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, it was really great for
our business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all selling out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the genetics guys that were making
bulk seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody kind of blew through their seed
stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, during COVID, it was like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, is the three months
before COVID, it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I wasn't sure if there was going to
be a good season or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really didn't think it was going to be
good because the previous year was a
[SPEAKER_05]: little slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 was tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 was tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then really it just marches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we started getting phone calls and
then, you know, I think everyone was
[SPEAKER_05]: excited about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were able to sell cannabis as a
whole, you know, in recreational,
[SPEAKER_05]: it wasn't like they're shutting down
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people were smoking a lot more weed and
buying more soil, buying more seeds,
[SPEAKER_05]: buying more lights, buying more
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it was a pretty amazing time
considering that it was so bad in other
[SPEAKER_05]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting though, because I
remember the end of 2019 going like
[SPEAKER_00]: October, November, where we generally slow
down a little bit as a soil company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupper is our year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powerhouse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tupper has definitely made its way and its
name for itself in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was something that was going on
where we could see the transition where we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't just going to be, you know,
quieting down and maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: drop a day or two off of production
because of the winter months, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially going through the holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: In December, I remember we started popping
off Tupper, especially down in the LA area
[SPEAKER_00]: on a different level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very, you know, regional,
you know, a little bit of Oklahoma,
[SPEAKER_00]: but definitely super hard in LA,
out in the desert, Palm Springs,
[SPEAKER_00]: desert hot springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were sending, you know, 20 trucks a
month through those months where we hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen anything with Tupper
specifically to that area before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, really popped for some reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so funny from year to year,
you can, you almost can't predict it
[SPEAKER_05]: because the years you think it's going to
be good, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the years you think it sucks,
all of a sudden it's good again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some pandemic pop out of nowhere
and you're like, we're fucking doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they kept saying overproduction is
going to be so bad for California
[SPEAKER_05]: overproduction for California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think we need interstate
commerce for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a must have for our
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to benefit everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, being able to export out of
California into places like North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I heard North Dakota just put on
their ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're trying to pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that again, which I think is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, them going to rec is one thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping up dispensaries everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when it's not federally legal and
every state has to come up with a plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate in that state in order to sell
it in that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they could just get forward to this
point where we, what are we at 34 states?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say at this point, we're so
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just moving past that goal line
finally, so that California can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: get a lot of that cultivation business
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon, California, Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they're all great places to
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I look forward to the day
where we can see California cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: New York, in Florida, in other places,
even though New York and Florida,
[SPEAKER_05]: they have cultivations out there,
but I would like to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, also New York flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I have in California, accessibility
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as much as it's a huge benefit
for California and the West coast to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to export the product, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for the emerging States,
it would benefit them so much to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality product coming from the West coast
to force competition and elevate the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer level cannabis that's entering
these facilities and give people an
[SPEAKER_02]: indication of what true quality cannabis
is, because you see it in every emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just boof.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much, there's the struggle to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so much poor quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's sad in one way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad people have access and it's
likely better than the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: press swag they had years past,
but to be able to help elevate that
[SPEAKER_02]: national game again, it's about community
and elevating the plant, the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it serves dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry seems to be like Instagram
driven, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows what the visuals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be in, you know, Bumfuck Iowa and
have a good idea of what really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good weed is supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the taste and smell that carry
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get in that, that
presentation, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, getting turned on as these states
go legal to good quality, high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis coming from California,
Oregon or Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, Instagram messed up
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of did a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the problem with it is,
is people look for the, it's the visual
[SPEAKER_05]: side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grew up smoking weed in the nineties
and some of the best weed I ever smoked in
[SPEAKER_05]: my entire life was also the ugliest weed
you ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now people are so fixated on the look
that it's almost prioritized above effect,
[SPEAKER_05]: above flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to have bag appeal and it almost
should be the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: They shouldn't matter really what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to pushing pre-rolls
into the rec markets with cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: partners that you don't actually get to
see the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going by taste, you're going by
effect and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the future of cannabis
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking a step back and like,
let's just take the look out of it and
[SPEAKER_05]: give people joints of really high quality
flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at the end of the day,
that's really what they want, even though
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't know they want it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's why pre-rolls sell so
well at all the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the shitty ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the shitty ones sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: 99% of them are just cardboard these days
and there's some good players.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to say there aren't good
pre-rolls out there, but I appreciate that
[SPEAKER_02]: effort to elevate that pre-roll game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when I buy from a dispensary,
it's normally cause I'm out of my own or
[SPEAKER_02]: traveling and just need something quick,
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going for a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all convenience.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why pens and pre-rolls do so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's convenient.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't, you don't have to have a pipe
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a bong or what, or dab rig.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you got your pens and these pens are
pretty good too.
[SPEAKER_05]: These, you know, we got rosin carts that
are just incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've gotten so much better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much better from 2010, you know,
the version one, the one point O's that
[SPEAKER_05]: they had the wick in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean all CO2 and propylene glycol.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not good to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's, it's wild that,
you know, the stages we've got,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've gone through over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the nineties and I mean, even the
hash that we're making now compared to
[SPEAKER_05]: then, you know, science took over about 10
years ago and really dived in and they
[SPEAKER_05]: started experimenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scientists got excited about it and
started figuring stuff out on another
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: There've been a couple of guys like K from
track couple of technologies that have
[SPEAKER_05]: been doing since the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really once we got this collective
effort of people elevating each other,
[SPEAKER_05]: now we have rosin carts, which I think
it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank the Lord for rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say as a, as a consumer,
I judged the Emerald cup for two years in
[SPEAKER_02]: a row in the cartridge category.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I saw that complete spectrum of
fake turps, glycol junk that are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big brands that are out there on
the market all the way to that top notch
[SPEAKER_02]: arcade of fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a lot of those guys that are
doing true live rosin cartridges that it
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes like you're licking a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I fully experienced that
besides bubble hash was with Holy water in
[SPEAKER_05]: 2013, the guys from Holy water,
uh, there was, uh, so there was Noel and
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike and all the guys from Holy water back
when they were all together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they hadn't spoiled patient collective
also did it, but the, that was like the
[SPEAKER_05]: first sauce, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that stuff you could pour it in the
rig or however you wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that tasted like a, the flower on
steroids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew they were something they were
onto something at the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: We entered some of their stuff at the cup
in Denver and we had judges apologizing to
[SPEAKER_05]: us that said we should have won,
but they didn't know how to categorize us
[SPEAKER_05]: with the extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and so, and since 2013,
it's just gotten better every year,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, with the live resin,
uh, just the processing, the understanding
[SPEAKER_05]: of the genetics, even now we're getting
into more of the genetic side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what washes well, what turps are
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I still love Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you talk about dabs and extract,
I love the candy stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I love the gassy stuff and the
honey bananas and the honeys, the,
[SPEAKER_05]: all these new varieties, these bananas are
pretty amazing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really unique note to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I hear some extractors talk
about, you know, Oh, banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of easy to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are like papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just make papaya all day or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an easy note to catch, but I like
that the industry is getting to that point
[SPEAKER_02]: where they can be selective and they're
like, let's find some new nuance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find some corners of the turp
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the volatile sulfur compounds and all
that haven't been explored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're talking to we, before we
just talk about banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's like, is it a banana chip?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a plantain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it an unripe banana?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a sweet banana?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it banana custard, banana pie?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of banana is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it taste like banana runs candy?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a banana Skittles that I made that
is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_05]: House cultivar in Seattle is running it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and, uh, we made some crosses with it
and did some really fun stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like it is candy banana, but then you
look at some of the crosses that we made,
[SPEAKER_05]: like with the Fort Collins cough,
I got the, so basically the banana cough
[SPEAKER_05]: and that one has some funk in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get some banana chip and you get
some like sweet floral banana.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some really interesting things in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that he just rolled off all those
banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like obviously a fan reminded me of that,
that shrimp scene in porous gump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that with strains too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go on for hours about all the old
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've been around for a while and
I've seen a lot of this stuff and I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been excited about genetics for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's just, it's fun to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun to talk about with guys that like
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you're in a room where there are
people that don't like talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a different story, but I feel you
on the way down here, I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kicking back, relaxing on the drive down
from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just thinking back knowing we're
coming to sit with you and talk genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, where did I start?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like thinking about to growing the
original skunk one, the Amsterdam skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one, the original Northern lights F1,
G 13, the original Shiva's Shiva Shanti
[SPEAKER_02]: one and two, and the Shiva skunks and like
the, all of those, you know, mid to late
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties Amsterdam genetics and the
original us versions of some that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, went over and got stabilized in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Amsterdam skunk got sweet
where the us skunk stayed dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't seen real skunk in over 20
years and the real nineties skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, going to grateful dead
shows, going to, you know, to shows in
[SPEAKER_05]: general, but also going down to Santa
Cruz.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a skunk that we used to get that
was called the strawberry cause it was
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberry sized nuggets, but it was a
skunk and that was as skunky as you could
[SPEAKER_05]: get.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you would get three nuggets,
maybe four, depending on, but they were
[SPEAKER_05]: all strawberry, nice, beautiful strawberry
nuggets in the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they call it the strawberry,
but it was skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was funny that they were calling it
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause back then it was like, it just all
fell under the dank weed category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt kind was like every strain grown
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this was probably early nineties,
92, 93, 94 ish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Santa Cruz, they did have names on
some of the stuff and people named it
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, crazy stuff too, just to market it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I didn't come out here until 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did summer tour 94, did the whole
breakdown and Humboldt thing like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else and never left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt's an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's, there's a lot of good
flower up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of good genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've come from up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they didn't even get credit for
coming up there, but really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been through a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely been up and down over the
years and decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it went through that,
that massive boom, you know, the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: rush, you know, the green rush all over
again, where it attracted people from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously with anything like that,
there's always going to be the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts, you know, whether it's on the
watersheds and environmental issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously just, you know, just blown up
the entire market on every level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting now to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of gone back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weighted a little bit, you know,
where you have the people that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: there for 30, 40 years and the people that
have always had, you know, great
[SPEAKER_00]: intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really care about the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about keeping their money from
cannabis in their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's been really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of thinned out a little bit,
you know, and, and the angst, the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are maybe not so, you know,
go, you know, cannabis, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not so angry and walking over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the divide seems to it,
you know, it's kind of subsided a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty nice and pleasant lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt's had a hard time throughout the
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it's been, it's,
it's been a fight and uphill battle
[SPEAKER_05]: probably since the seventies, you know,
for the communities to get used to the
[SPEAKER_05]: people growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it to become, that was the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became the Mecca.
[SPEAKER_05]: It became the Mecca.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really, what the community was
based around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the money coming into the community
was based on cannabis, whether people
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they believe it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they believe it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once rec happened, the
regulations, they made it really hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with Stefan Humboldt and to be able
to step into the legal market for the guys
[SPEAKER_05]: that had done it for 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved out there in 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Michigan, was cultivating
back there, full black market,
[SPEAKER_02]: no legality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we had all these, underground
great genetics because there weren't a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of pollen chuckers out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I moved to Humboldt and it was just,
I feel kind of the beginning of it really
[SPEAKER_02]: taking over where every house in Arcata
had a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the city was trying to
figure out how to fix the housing crisis
[SPEAKER_02]: because there was one person living in
half of the houses and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bedrooms were grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point, it blew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got out of hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were pollen chuckers everywhere,
10,000 plus grows in the hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has, it's subsided so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, easily 10% is left of
what there was in that peak in the like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the mid 2000s, 07 through 12,
I would say is when it just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: populated itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember back then when outdoor,
you know, I would say pre 2000s,
[SPEAKER_05]: mid 2000s, outdoor was as expensive as
indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the top shelf outdoor, it may be even
more expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, $4,500 a pound for some,
some outdoor, some sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially back in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a lot of indoor the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, you know, in the late
nineties, if you were doing two or lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was, it was all small stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas people were going big outside that
big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still pretty much 45 to five grand
a pound across the board, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh Freeman, he $4,500 for his freaking
sour diesel back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was probably worth every cent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was sticky and it had that sour
diesel punch where you open the bag and it
[SPEAKER_05]: hits you in the face.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to drive up to Humboldt to get
crazy weed too, where it was, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: see that stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't see the stuff where you owe the
skunks, the real, uh, potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's not that there's not great
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the stuff where you open the
bag and it would punch you in the face
[SPEAKER_05]: with smell and aroma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and then that stuff was sticky and
cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's so resonance and you still
see stuff that's resonance and you still
[SPEAKER_05]: see stuff that smells and smokes great,
but I feel like it's just different,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that time period, late 2000s,
mid to late 2000s where you're a 100%
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sours, some train wrecks and some like
heritage Humboldt stop, the salmon Creek,
[SPEAKER_02]: big bud and things like that were out
there, but it was all so much pure gas and
[SPEAKER_02]: there wasn't pure gas coming from anywhere
else in the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when there was some like,
like Hindu Kush, there was the HK that was
[SPEAKER_05]: coming down out of the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these things punch you in the face
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was like, there was some stuff that
it was sweeter or more musky, but man,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was the seagull shit,
the guano, the soil that was better back
[SPEAKER_05]: then, the genetics combination of all of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like back in the nineties,
when I first started up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody went from seed every single
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no mass buying of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a vigor there that you're
losing every time, you know, as it went
[SPEAKER_00]: more commercial and more and more farms
were popping up with multiple greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: on each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go from clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and people probably bred away from
the turps too, but bred away from the
[SPEAKER_05]: smell because it was what could get you in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there was a point where like,
you didn't want your stuff to smell so
[SPEAKER_05]: strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the chem dog was so strong that
you could smell that from forever away
[SPEAKER_05]: driving up to your property.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten miles or five miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes like in the right wind,
you'd be like, all right, we're getting
[SPEAKER_05]: close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Train wreck was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a whole field of train wreck one
time and then people on the highway,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends would be like, man, like we can
smell it from the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's not fucking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember driving down, you know,
40 miles of dirt road that would take you
[SPEAKER_05]: half a day to get down to go to the farm
and you'd smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you know, five miles out,
four miles out sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can never tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it could be someone else's,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, things were different back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where like, it's really a
unique and interesting time in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry now and that we're able to sit
here on a podcast, mic'd up, camered up
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk about these things that you were
scared to talk about in a restaurant back
[SPEAKER_05]: then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't want anybody overhearing this
stuff, you know, and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: it very freely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the beauty of legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whether you, some people don't
like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people hate on legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's silly that we should
have people in prison for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the bottom line is
non-violent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't put violent crime, don't put people
in prison for that shit and treat it like
[SPEAKER_05]: alcohol, treat it like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's way safer than both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization doesn't have to be a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just unfortunate that as they've,
especially, you know, California is
[SPEAKER_00]: overtly, it's overtaxed and over-regulated
and the hoops that you're making everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that's already been in the game,
you know, go through the compliance stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving the goalposts or you can do
compliance work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tell you one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you're a quarter
million invested into your farm that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've already been on and growing at for
10, 15 years to find out actually now your
[SPEAKER_00]: property is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely, you know, keeping people
out of jail as somebody who's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, didn't grow up with a dad
because he was busted for marijuana in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York in 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, to have families
ruined, to have people never be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify for financial aid to get an
education at some point when they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, there's so many things that
are just used to kind of break down
[SPEAKER_00]: society and the family structure and to
make people's lives, especially people
[SPEAKER_00]: with color, as we know that, you know,
always been, you know, directed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way to eradicate that while
still allowing some sort of free market
[SPEAKER_00]: business and let people, you know,
conduct, you know, what they would any
[SPEAKER_00]: other manufacturing, you know,
when it comes to wine or alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at the wine industry alone,
just apples to oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And taking it further to start to quantify
the agriculture as agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: let alone the manufacturing and processing
and things like that, I think is
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no crop regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even tobacco isn't regulated like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No food.
[SPEAKER_05]: No food.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that is a positive for at
least those who are aware and paying
[SPEAKER_02]: attention to that, that we can improve
those practices for food, for other crops
[SPEAKER_02]: and for just general cultivation of all
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regenerative agriculture, I feel like has
gotten a huge boost from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people got into organics because
they wanted to smoke organic weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're like, well, maybe I should
get organic broccoli.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's really a gateway crop
in a big way.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that gateway crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, you guys need to trademark it,
put it on shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the gateway crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a, that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a CoLab t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we print t-shirts in the building now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we don't have a printer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use the film and then we do heat press.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's super easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause then you have each size of your
shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to stock the pre-printed
ones and you do them to order.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, that's just for our,
mostly for giveaways.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for our basic t-shirts that we have,
so everybody could have shirts and we got
[SPEAKER_05]: a hat press now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we press hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Epic talk about vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for us, it's like a saving time
and space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we could pay to have them
printed and sure, you know, but,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we have a fulfillment room and we use
our fulfillment room fully.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never thought I'd be in a t-shirt
business, but you know, yeah, life twists
[SPEAKER_02]: and turns, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we move in dog years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what really excites me about
the current time too, is that I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: we're starting a new dog year,
so to speak, you know, coming out of
[SPEAKER_02]: pandemic, we had some leveling back out
and kind of restructuring of the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it seems like this year, grow stores
are busy again.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are cultivating at home again in a
new way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the commercial facilities are
like, actually I'm, I'm doing better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Running the same program I was two years
ago than I was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're still around, you're probably
doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that there's a lot of change
over some of the facilities, some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the bigger MSOs that they didn't
make it, but they had their facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: were up and running and sort of tight for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got people that were running a
facility somewhere else and being
[SPEAKER_00]: successful taking over the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm seeing a lot more of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can jump in for pennies on the
dollar now, cause you have all these built
[SPEAKER_05]: out facilities that are going up for,
sale with licenses.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your SOPs are dialed in and you can
show some investors even like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, listen, I got this other facility up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to carry everything over
the same program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to get money than you were
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, we've never actually done
anything like this on this scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: but believe in me, I've got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't, that didn't work out very
well for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all money is good money.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good lesson, you know,
and I think people, you'll learn,
[SPEAKER_05]: learn it sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're working with investors,
but yeah, not all money is good money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people coming in from other countries,
trying to invest into our businesses is
[SPEAKER_05]: not always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if they don't have their head wrapped
around really a positive intention,
[SPEAKER_02]: it ends up getting convoluted and people
start chasing their tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it becomes only about money,
you're not, it's going to be really tough
[SPEAKER_05]: to be successful if you're only focused on
money, because then you've got to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be the biggest and you got to
yield the heaviest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it takes a lot of the best genetic
side of the picture for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes the way you cultivate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying you have to sacrifice
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's things that we don't sacrifice,
you know, being small business owners,
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting costs, cutting costs definitely
has helped drive the quality of our,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flower coming out drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, and I get it,
the market drives it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta, you gotta pay attention to
those things, but it did it in such a way
[SPEAKER_00]: where the quality literally just
diminished to a great degree, no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what state you were cultivating in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of these guys, celebrities
early on, they wanted to slap their name
[SPEAKER_05]: on a cannabis brand because they got
excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: It ruined their name for cannabis because
they had an inferior product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to name any names,
but I think it was really sad seeing some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these people that I really respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they have a shitty product on the
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, fuck, you know,
now that's, that's kind of changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody kind of learns from each
other's mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now things have changed a little
bit, but the quality is definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: improved in real time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I remember there was a time where
I wouldn't smoke anything that you could
[SPEAKER_05]: get in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just, I'd rather smoke stuff from
all my friends, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now things have changed and
there's good stuff in some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, small percentage of the products,
but small is better than none.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to the grocery store, there's a
small organic section.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of that quality too,
probably comes from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: working out some of the kinks in distro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's such a lag in the distro,
man, half of what you're getting on those
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple of years have been sitting
around for way too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the farm to table model is like
learning the distribution model to where
[SPEAKER_05]: you can improve it to get more of a farm
to table approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm such a big advocate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Advocate of being able to go buy cannabis
from the farms up in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_05]: up in Mendocino, up in Sonoma,
to be able to go shop at your,
[SPEAKER_05]: learn the story of the flower,
how it was grown, go talk to the farmer
[SPEAKER_05]: and then be able to buy it right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, besides the terroir and all this
other stuff, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think having that model where it's
like direct from the farmer, you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: it fresh and the good farms, they're going
to sell through it really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to get a really fresh
product and they're going to store it
[SPEAKER_05]: correctly and all the other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's not fresh, it's been
stored correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, the distro model,
I think that was the broken piece that so
[SPEAKER_02]: much great, great quality cannabis got
ruined completely and was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: B minus by the time it got to consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much of the B minus when it went
into distro fail, it was just trash when
[SPEAKER_02]: it was moving out of distro and through
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it set the retail market in California
back in a huge way because people didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to shop for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would rather go back to their
original black market plugs and get
[SPEAKER_02]: something that they could count on tasting
good, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tasting good, giving you the effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, it's a, it's interesting
lumpies brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure where they're at right now,
but when they were medical before rec,
[SPEAKER_05]: the flower was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I was excited to get a
fricking jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was at Harbor side one time and
I saw the flower there and I had a meeting
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, this is in rec and I bought it
and I was so disappointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't their fault though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't lumpy's fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was actually the fact that he had
been on the shelves for six months and not
[SPEAKER_05]: stored in a temperature controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in a jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what, what do you expect when that
kind of stuff happens and figuring it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one thing when that happens to
you, you know, you've been in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: a long enough time to have, to understand
why, but so many new consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a new emerging market, don't know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that first experience from a distro
tainted product now moves them off that
[SPEAKER_02]: brand forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Likely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but it's a real interesting thing
because you can get stuff that's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fresher.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's better than the product that's been
on the shelf longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes you can like get a brand
where you're like, Oh man, I see this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff and the products then garbage and
you never want to smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just ruins it for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really it wasn't necessarily the
brand's fault.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the fault of, I don't, I don't know
whose fault it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to play on system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not always a good go-to system,
right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's take a, let's take a dive back
into your history.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you guys got started.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys meet all that good stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I already told you, I broke down on a
bus on dead tour and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked up with a girl, almost got married,
started a life in Humboldt, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: originally from, from New York city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From, you know, a place where there wasn't
farmer markets and nature other than
[SPEAKER_00]: central park or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so yeah, I found Humboldt and
was like, man, this place is just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just something just pulled on my
heartstrings in a way that I had never
[SPEAKER_00]: felt before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 22, 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 20 or 21, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty high back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, I just, I just never left,
you know, then obviously the whole culture
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, back to nature, you know,
I mean, growing up in a place like New
[SPEAKER_00]: York city, you have no connection to your
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew how vegetables were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how, how meat was killed and
processed or anything like you just buy it
[SPEAKER_00]: on a, on a shelf of a store and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really, really interested in just
being so connected to that part of life
[SPEAKER_00]: and learning, becoming more sustainable,
you know, all these things that I just
[SPEAKER_00]: never even heard of, you know,
coming up in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously there was the cannabis
culture that really lured me in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, my first grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I was able to, you know, be a part of
in 94, 95 plant that I had been smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a little dabbling on the East
coast, but highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after what had happened to my dad,
I was like, man, I can't do that to my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't until I was out here that I
was like, wow, man, like just really blown
[SPEAKER_00]: away by the plant, like beyond smoking and
consuming it and having it lift me up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from the inside being watching
the plant grow, you know, learning its
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to it, playing guitar and singing
to my girls and like, and feeling that
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm pretty sure that,
you know, when I would consume it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would almost come back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like the cycle that was
happening and I just got so overwhelmed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the joy of growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my upbringing was a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Southwest Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were right along Lake Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could walk out to the lake and walk in
the dunes and the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nothing like the wilderness we
have in California, but it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: connection that was really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I started working on farms,
you know, just like detassling corn and
[SPEAKER_02]: picking potatoes and things like that when
I was young, because I was looking for a
[SPEAKER_02]: job and trying to just get money,
easy money when you're working in high
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then summer is 14, 15, and then
started going to see the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all blew up for me there and
started you know, smoking herb,
[SPEAKER_02]: eating mushrooms, things like that,
and came back and immediately started
[SPEAKER_02]: growing weed and was growing weed by 94 in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was again, highly illegal and you
could only trust a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it built this camaraderie among a
small group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you had one buddy that knew,
and then he had one buddy that he like
[SPEAKER_02]: started warming up enough to, to include.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, just the circle
stacked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up, you know, seeing the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having a great time with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started growing herb, growing dead seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, picking up bags at every show I
went to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like chasing the kind bud at dead
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many eights can I get of different
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take home, hopefully I find a seed in this
or a seed in that and growing it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was really my intro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so I chased around black
market cultivation in Michigan until
[SPEAKER_02]: basically 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started getting hot, hot in
Michigan for all of our teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I moved to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm either going to go to
prison or I'm going to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So California seemed like a much better
choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a big fan of the Michigan skunk,
which was a skunk number one, Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rocked it for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was one of the true special
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did some breeding with it back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did some Fino hunting with some of the
crosses, but yeah, it was special for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that bubble gum that ended up in
Michigan that we chased it down and got it
[SPEAKER_02]: out of Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally an Oklahoma seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so funny, the stories surrounding
that and the confusion, the Indiana bubble
[SPEAKER_05]: gum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it was from Indiana or wherever it
was from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the seeds from that gray
area, um, cannabis cup winning bubble gum
[SPEAKER_02]: went to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys started growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People had a falling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody went and stole cuttings off of an
outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it like got drifted out to
Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked it on fish tour in 1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, I will find this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took me a year and a half to track
it down to a guy in, uh, in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got cuttings, took it to Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it back up to Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It spread into Indiana from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They blew it out in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, uh, Simon from Sirius,
Tony from Sagamarta, Adam Dunn all had
[SPEAKER_05]: their versions, versions of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still a great base genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the coolest things about
that bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of sidelining here, but is that
it was the first strain to me that I
[SPEAKER_02]: learned the difference between how things
trickle into flower outdoor and indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stays small.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 56 ish days, super glossy,
smaller nuggets, but like chunky and hard
[SPEAKER_02]: and pilly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started growing it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, wow, it's not finishing
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stacking big giant tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all came down to the trickle into
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really kind of opened my eyes to
how that dynamic of how things shift into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, whether it triggers all at once at
1212, or if it's a slow art, I'm kicking
[SPEAKER_02]: pre flowers, but I'm still stretching and
building that structure really opened my
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes to the way cannabis plant build
structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the one equatorial plants,
how they go in and out of vets and they
[SPEAKER_05]: can keep taking double or triple or
quadruple size grow into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like some of the original hazes were
like, that especially the stuff coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of Florida in the late nineties,
that those were the true, true hazes,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the nevels and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, oh yeah, that stuff would double
triple all day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And put out some amazing smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still like smoking that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those are the strands that when
you walk into even a concert and somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked a joint, you're like, where's that
haze at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a hard phenotype or a hard
super cell file.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's around this, the super silver
is, but again, it drifted sweet five
[SPEAKER_05]: finest stuff like the Neville's a five
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of ammonia E almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not cat piss, but it was still a
mo it was the closest thing to cat piss
[SPEAKER_05]: that I saw in Europe when people were
like, Oh, cat piss is like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I swear I'm like, well, kind of that's
a fucking straight ammonia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was like the ammonia haze
is what they should have called it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that you were saying you're working
with the cat piss on the way down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about how much I miss the
cat piss and the cheetah piss isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I like the cheetah piss,
but it's not cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing that I've seen in 20
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the real cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what people say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm growing some stuff out hoping it is,
but we're filming a documentary talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about the stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also part of the documentary is
recreating it and potentially using some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these blends and stuff that we find
that has interesting traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, we got super silver,
we got Northern lights and we're putting
[SPEAKER_05]: those together and we're doing some skunk
with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to find some interesting
stuff along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we don't, but cat piss is a
description of a smell and aroma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's multiple cat pisses,
even though people are like, I had the
[SPEAKER_05]: real cat piss.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you probably did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so did this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so did this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they could all been different because
it's the description of an aroma,
[SPEAKER_05]: not blue dream or not Romulan or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very specific name that goes along
with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, the original cat piss,
as I was told when I first started
[SPEAKER_02]: accessing it, the Colorado cat piss was an
NL five blueberry, just like the cough is
[SPEAKER_02]: what that NL five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, is that Fort Collins?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was that true F1 NL five that
circulated pretty wildly in the mid
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties that became breeding magic for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those lanky long arms just were like the
basis of what you could do to something
[SPEAKER_02]: that like put out little peanuts or it
gave you structure and dependability to
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these more nuanced things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still see NL popping up in all kinds of
stuff for pheno hunting that doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily have it in its lineage,
but it's definitely NL, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: unmistakably Northern Lights
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got in the gene pool heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still a favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came into some from Eden Farms shortly
right after they had won the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was five or six years ago or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, I sucked on that for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't share it with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I told you that I had it,
but I was like, I'm already out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stash it to, you know, nobody,
including my wife can find it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then, yeah, once I get attached to
something, I want to smoke all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mind sharing with my friends
too, cause I feel like that's the beauty
[SPEAKER_05]: of it is to be able to, especially my
friends that are super passionate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, Oh man, I got to share.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to either smoke it with them or give
this guy a little bit to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you know, I've found myself in my
later years here where like some strains
[SPEAKER_00]: really resonate well with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the newer stuff just doesn't
work well for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about gelatos?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's gelato.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel like the majority,
80% of what's on the market is gelato
[SPEAKER_05]: based.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the gelato is the foundation and
maybe cookies even in with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the gelato characteristics are across,
you know, it's like the desserts we're in
[SPEAKER_05]: the era of desserts, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's beautiful and it's sad
all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The beautiful side is that we get people
trying cannabis that probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have normally smoked shit like cat piss or
skunk or any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You give that to them and they'd be like,
I'm not even touching stuff that smells
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you give stuff that smells like candy
or like cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we had some cheesecake back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh Freeman, another guy that was his,
he had a cheesecake, but it wasn't so
heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Heavy on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't get stuff that tasted like
papaya and mango and skittles and whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucky charms.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some new lucky charm shit that's
smells pretty cereal-like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even the bubble gum didn't really
smell like bubble gum back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: It did on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you grew it, it smelled like
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like when you smoked it,
it wasn't like you got fake bubble gum
[SPEAKER_05]: turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's really what bubble gum is,
is like that fake kind of bubble gummy
[SPEAKER_05]: smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bazooka, you know, the bazooka Joe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that was my big disappointment
over the years with bubble gum is it just
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't transfer to aroma and flavor in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the crosses did much better with
that, but that original bubble gum is
[SPEAKER_02]: special as it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my biggest complaints
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my buddy Rick from Mosca Negra,
he's done some cool crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been on the show before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good friends and we've done span of
us together a bunch and yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He comes out and visits and he's a foodie
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's funny that you really see people
that get into cannabis turps are foodies
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're, we're living life through
the, you know, olfactory senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like exactly turp chasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You chase it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just chasing flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't drink as much beer
anymore, even though I love Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to work with Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another company that is founded on the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we all have that Grateful Dead
influence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us in the cannabis industry do
and other things, you know, I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: Laganitas is the perfect example.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Tony McGee, Jeremy Marshall
doing their things, but like dead heads at
[SPEAKER_05]: heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, the, the, the stuff
they learned on either on tour or going to
[SPEAKER_05]: the shows or whatever kind of passed on
and got carried in through their business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like the evolution of the
Grateful Dead in so many ways,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we're not musicians,
but we're, we're carrying on a legacy
[SPEAKER_05]: that's much bigger than our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I feel 100% the same, that euphoria,
that moment that captured people at
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead concerts became contagious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to take a piece of that home
and share it with our community and kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of live in that list out moment of,
you know, a top quality eyes, but you had
[SPEAKER_02]: to find different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's one of those things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, they were part of a,
a bigger scene as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, while obviously they were a next
level and, and proving themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for five decades since they
started out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but so much of that and where
they came from and where they got their
[SPEAKER_00]: magic from was this greater thing,
this greater love that was exploding
[SPEAKER_00]: through Northern California out of the
summer love and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up into the Hills, you know,
all around from Santa Cruz up to
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of stuff has, because of that,
we are a direct effect of what happened in
[SPEAKER_05]: the sixties and seventies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It evolved into where we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: This conversation right now, we can
contribute part of this conversation that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're having to things that happened in
the sixties and seventies, thanks to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Grateful Dead and other musicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: And other people back then, all these
revolutionaries guys that are passing away
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken Kesey, the whole prankster movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually am likely going to get George
Walker and some of those original
[SPEAKER_02]: pranksters on our podcast, Royal ground
radio next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a prankster ball up in
Humboldt and send them my way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a formal invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to come up Friday and
Saturday, the third and fourth,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of the original prankster
families.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to descend on Humboldt and have
a feast, have amazing music with like Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: Coran and some of those, you know,
deep rooted Grateful Dead connected
[SPEAKER_02]: musicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be special, but those
stories are going away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, we really have to capture them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one reason I love what you're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the reasons I do it is
because I feel like the oral history of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, we talk about this a lot,
but I feel like it's so important to
[SPEAKER_05]: capture the oral history of cannabis on
the, the levels that we can, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's so many different levels and so
it's not all about genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not all about soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not all about lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not all about any one of these
things, the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about us as a community with the
individuals in the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the guys that were, you know,
we're on the shoulders of these giants
[SPEAKER_05]: that started the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those guys are slowly dying off each
one of them, you know, because,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, time is so limited and so short.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we don't get it now, we're not
going to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to get it, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's a beautiful thing to be
able to become part of a community that's
[SPEAKER_05]: so much bigger than yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, this energy force,
which we all are part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, we get some of that
feedback from our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all girl on radio where we've got
subscribers internationally in Africa and
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe that really, you know,
they know cannabis from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there, but they don't,
they don't know the rich history in
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California running from
helicopters, you know, the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bush era of, you know, breaking down
people's gates and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they, they, there's those stories
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Holy shit, you guys really
have been dealing with this for decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people don't even understand the
whole reason we grow inside now is because
[SPEAKER_05]: of the cops and the helicopters and people
hiding from the cops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we'd probably still be growing
outside 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if it wasn't like that in the,
in the late seventies or early eighties,
[SPEAKER_05]: we would probably still do the majority of
our cultivation outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be an indoor thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll say something I never thought I
would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Reagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor and underground in a big way with
the green sweep and like just attacking
[SPEAKER_02]: from the federal government standpoint and
funding the state governments to attack it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to meme that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little quick video of him being
like, thank you, Reagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to take that out of
context.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to build your shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll print them next door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Reagan shirts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally agree, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indoor is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's how I was lucky enough to get
started because we couldn't grow outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would, you had five plants,
even in a cornfield and they would land a
[SPEAKER_02]: helicopter to kill five plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, but you could get away with
a couple of HIDs in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the Grateful Dead,
you know, one of the cool things when I
[SPEAKER_00]: first got to California, I got invited to
live in this old community, intentional
[SPEAKER_00]: community commune, if you have it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was originally started by the
Digger family in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people that started the
human being and the open door clinics and
[SPEAKER_00]: the food kitchens for all the homeless
kids that were flooding into San Francisco
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer of love and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember, you know, finding out from
some of the elders that had started it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 25 years before I got there
that, you know, Janice, the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: business in San Francisco, some Hollywood
stars had donated money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put up money to buy this place to
kind of push in that direction of the Back
[SPEAKER_00]: to Nature movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I was living in this community,
getting to know these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was for the first time,
you know, being a dead end from New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City, all of a sudden being like,
wow, man, I'm in Northern California and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like hanging out with people who are
directly touched by the band, by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Grateful Dead and by maybe what happened
in San Francisco during that really
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful era in our history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you know, there's like
an honor of being a part of something
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than who we are as individuals,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost been like a responsibility
to live differently, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: better intentions, be a good person,
you know, take care of your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's those things where,
you know, just that little, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you always say, germ of an
idea that started in San Francisco back
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever, you know, probably beyond San
Francisco, but maybe with the sunshines,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then it just keeps
blossoming and spreading and spreading and
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I was 25 years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just such a beautiful, powerful
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt honored and so fortunate to be this
kid living in this, you know, community
[SPEAKER_00]: that was started right from the roots of
the very scene that I cherished and was
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a whole lot of what
you're chasing around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a, I have a lot of
gratitude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to live in gratitude,
you know, with so many things in the world
[SPEAKER_05]: going crazy and bad, it's like,
there's so many things to still be
[SPEAKER_05]: grateful for.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that was kind of the
things, one of the things I learned from
[SPEAKER_05]: the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I learned from the music
was to always be grateful.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what's going on, there's always
a bright side to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for me, part of it was
learning to be accountable to myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: to try and carry on the work of the
legends that inspired me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates this sense of responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow, these guys did so much
work to change the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have gotten to live the joyous
life I've gotten to live if they hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: worked so hard and struggled through
getting rated in New Orleans and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these crazy things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Timothy Leary's, the Albert Hoffman's,
changing the world through deep dedication
[SPEAKER_02]: to their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: It inspires me to work harder and to
elevate the things that I feel nuanced
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really a cool thing
that's happened to this industry over the
[SPEAKER_02]: last five to seven years because of the
way it exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've taken your inspiration and moved it
into genetics along with other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my inspiration took me into soil
science and like understanding what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in the soil to grow better
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And led me down this road of, oh,
wow, cocoa fiber is more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a local company that just started
up trying to create cocoa fiber mediums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go work with them because I
feel like I can have a beneficial impact
[SPEAKER_02]: to myself, to my peers, to, to cannabis in
general and the industry and maybe find a
[SPEAKER_02]: new path out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really that ability to like hone
in on the microcosm of what inspires you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I think builds greatness in whatever
it is that you dedicate yourself to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Michael was just saying,
you know, some of the elders and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that, you know, start us all
off on our path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a big shout out to a guy who
just passed away on Earth Day a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days ago, Petey Brucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a guy that lived on that
commune.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the old schoolers back in
the day, a great cannabis grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: great father, great community member.
[SPEAKER_00]: He organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, noxious weed pulling along the
riverfront.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was all about, you know, being on top
of the forest service when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: okaying a crazy logging sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was instrumental in working with
the native tribes, the Yurok and the Karuk
[SPEAKER_00]: tribes to do away with the Klamath River
dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was his life's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the late eighties, he started Salmon
River Restoration Council, working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Klamath River Alliance and got the dam
removed right before he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the, he was allowed to go there
with just a few selected people,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the tribe members, and got to
watch it get taken down with his own eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shortly after said, you know,
I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Petey Brucker, love you,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respect Petey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Mesford, another one, he died on 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: He held out.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one tough son of a bitch held out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's, he's been in pain or he'd
been in pain for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known Dave a really long time and I
didn't know he was going through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got the news, it was
devastating.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, he was a humbug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble giant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I flew up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to him, uh, the, the Saturday I
did a podcast the week before exactly one
[SPEAKER_05]: week before he passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to him the Thursday before I
said, or the Wednesday before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, you know, I'd like to make it
up so we can hang out and I'll try to make
[SPEAKER_05]: it up there on Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, I'll try to make it till
Monday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew right then it was bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Friday morning, I flew 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: interviewed him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a amazing person.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a special podcast that we,
we just, uh, aired for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's, we're losing some great
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, life is short, you know,
appreciate your friends and family and
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure you tell them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing he said was I love you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it to the people that you care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it as often as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel cheesy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel like you can't say I love you
to your bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cook Wagyu steak for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went up there and so nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my partner was like, you should see if
there's anything on his bucket list you
[SPEAKER_05]: can help him out with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm thinking, bucket list.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to ask him if there's anything he,
he needs me to bring up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started like going down the list of,
you know, caviar, this, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, can I cook for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, have you had Wagyu?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, well, I bought Wagyu at
Costco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, no, that's not Wagyu.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we got some A5 BMS 12 and I brought
that up there for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He lived in Japan, but this was in the
eighties, early eighties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't the same, you know,
and the Wagyu today is just, it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: eating butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't even personally like it
that much anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got, we blew out through COVID.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ate too much of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we had parties at my house and I
would cook it and I didn't eat too much of
[SPEAKER_05]: it typically, but a lot of my friends did,
but eating it so many times, you just
[SPEAKER_05]: don't appreciate it as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm big on like getting one or two
bites of it and then I'm good for the
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need it to sit on my stomach and
make my stomach upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But man, it's a, it was special.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I cooked, we did two podcasts,
one on Friday and then one again on
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday, he only had enough energy to do
about an hour and a half for each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I cooked Wagyu after each one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we enjoyed a meal together and he
was there with his family when he passed
[SPEAKER_05]: and just an incredible soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kanekon, one of the founders of Kanekon,
big into the hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's the one who got me going to hemp
fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And his photography was just next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, passionate about the plant though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him at the first Kanekon we've at
Royal gold has done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think almost every single Kanekon we've
supported them since the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, great guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've, they've done a great job of
helping get the word out, helping nurture,
[SPEAKER_02]: developing markets, emerging markets and
putting on good grassroots events and
[SPEAKER_05]: putting on really good grassroots events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's not a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a handful of people that have
put on good events over the years and
[SPEAKER_05]: they've done a great job with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Dave, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You inspired a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it just makes you realize how
short life really is and how blessed we
[SPEAKER_05]: are to have health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cause without health,
you don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just turned 50 and it's something all of
a sudden is like what they say as you get
[SPEAKER_00]: older, you know, it happens, something
triggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they call it like midlife crisis
even, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had my midlife crisis when I was
like 35.
Honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I just, but, but you know,
it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause as we get older, we become better
storytellers so we can pass on,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can pass on the stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we have stories to tell as we're
older, but like we're able to pass this
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff on to the younger generations and
you know, it's a pretty cool thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, feeling that homage to
people like Dave, people like Petey,
[SPEAKER_02]: it inspires us to do better work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you want to get involved in your
community when you see somebody like that
[SPEAKER_02]: pass and realize that the work they were
doing was so monumental and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're gone and who's going to
carry that torch and someone needs to step
[SPEAKER_05]: up and there's not always someone to step
up unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a younger generation that us
that, that really is getting exposed right
[SPEAKER_02]: now or has been exposed for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the benefit of generations
of work that went into making better
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, better genetics, better
knowledge for them to take it to the next
[SPEAKER_02]: level still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited to continue to have
my mind blown by the younger generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: new, new genetics, new combinations of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the new blood I'm looking forward to
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I've, I think there are a lot of
lazy kids out there, but there are a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of good ones too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the younger generation, there's lots
of lazy ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my parents thought of the same
thing about my generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably each generation has gotten a
little lazier because of convenience and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even want to roll joints
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to do dabs, you know,
but, but, you know, you heard that we
[SPEAKER_00]: walked to school both ways uphill in the
snow barefoot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I really did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but, but my grandfather's generation,
they were tough on a different level.
[SPEAKER_05]: My father's generation was tough too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my father wouldn't take shit off
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen my father fight a lot,
you know, fist fight and these younger
[SPEAKER_05]: guys, they don't understand what that's
all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now everyone has guns and knives and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have to talk shit on and you
didn't talk shit because if you did,
[SPEAKER_05]: you ended up learning real quick how that
was going to go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, either you were going to get
beat up or knocked out or you were going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be the one beating somebody up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you settled stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't use knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't murder anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just went out and duked it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get in fights.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got in fights too.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wouldn't say I got in trouble a
lot when I was a kid, but it wasn't the
[SPEAKER_05]: same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you weren't going to get locked up
for getting in a fist fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I think now it's really kind
of taken the fight to I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_02]: outperform you and whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has some benefits long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, screw you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grow better streams than you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to develop better genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make better soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to talk shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to do the best I can do at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in competition with anybody else
doing genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see them as competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they see me as competition,
whatever, I don't care, but I'm just going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be the best I can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes that stuff gives like the
haters give me motivation to work harder,
[SPEAKER_05]: wake up in the morning and get out of bed
and work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like that's what gets me going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes is the hate and I'm okay with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, finding motivation and so your
enemies can make you stronger.
Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came over to Royal gold from a
grower to, uh, to work with the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using as a grower, it was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm not, I'm a lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't get in, I don't get
caught up in anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just remember the other competing
soil brands that were out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, trade shows and vendor
days at grow stores and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were blown away, you know,
with I come into their booth and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's up and introduce myself and,
you know, talk to them for four minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: and then give them a hug and go back to my
booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just standing there like,
that'll just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and there was, there was so
much of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's kind of changed
miraculously across the board with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, most companies,
I think, at this point, we're all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: out there as family, even the competing
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we've all made it through
this huge, tough time, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This world wind where a lot of people fell
off and aren't around anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their companies don't exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're still around, I think there's
a lot more support for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, also a lot of us have been around for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the, we've been to events for
so long and the genetic side is still
[SPEAKER_05]: weird people, you know, egos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get E, especially with genetics,
these guys that aren't even real breeders
[SPEAKER_05]: talking like they're real breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, and I don't judge whatever you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put out the best genetics that I
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to inform people the best that I
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully I'm successful at it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a hundred, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look back to some of these
genetics that we were just talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, it wasn't a master breeder
necessarily that ended up with the skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one or that bag seed that stumbled on what
became Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, grateful dead show 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and people took that inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, wow, this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I make it better or shape it in
this way?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, in a big way,
those are the people that inspire you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your competition is the people that
brought you in energetically to the world
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're like, wow, these guys are
doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing in this soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what could be better?
[SPEAKER_02]: What could be better about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But really you got to pay homage because
you wouldn't be where you are without that
[SPEAKER_02]: path through their products.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's something to be said for
given respect where respect is due as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you guys get your start with
soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, is it just a immaculate inception?
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that was like one day you
decide, cause I know there's, there's been
[SPEAKER_05]: holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was, you know, the seasons got
harder and harder, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was that window in humble
where, you know, there was an element of
[SPEAKER_00]: violence that was coming out of the hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, a lot of shootouts in the middle
of the night, just firing into the
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness across a creek, you know,
and arming your 18 year old trimmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: laborers that are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was that element that I didn't sign
up for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ups and downs of the industry,
finding good workers, good people to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you run a farm on a hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was always a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you, once you paid them out,
that, that first debt, they, they'd fall
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once everybody got a little taste of that
money, like that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be at the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be up on top of the mountain at the
full moon rave.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, or they get enough money.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could do it on their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I have three young kids,
my wife and I, and I had been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal Gold since their first or second
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, you know, I just kind of got
tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt like I was ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bad season, kind of hermed out a
bunch of stuff from a genetic I got from
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just felt like it was time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know what, you know,
I can still do a little something,
[SPEAKER_00]: something on the side, but I'm going to do
what I feel like, you know, I need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for my family to be more consistent,
have a steady pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like, you know, I loved the company
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were already friends at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think when I first started,
it was funny because I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of jumping around and doing
all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came back from a sales trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the only sales guy for the entire
company nationwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'm on a forklift and he's like,
you know, he knows I'm a customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Hey, Reg, he's like,
dude, you can't just be loading your own
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go out the forklift and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, man, I got a job
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I have an, I have a better
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, I need to grow the sales
team and you're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the soils where it really all
started, like I'd been growing since like
[SPEAKER_02]: 94 and there weren't soils available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there are today, we would get pro mix
and we'd have to mix all of the individual
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments in ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there wasn't a lot to pick from.
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't, it was peat moss and there
was really shitty stuff that you could get
[SPEAKER_05]: like the home depots or the home base back
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you could get a black gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not out East.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not out East.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not available in Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first bag of Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even saw it was in like 99 or 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd been making all of our own soils
for years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I was not, I wasn't the best
student in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too busy chasing the grateful dead
and you know, taking acid on the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wasn't going to graduate and I
was like, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to take college correspondence
course and I'm like, what can I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to just be painful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took a soil science class and it
absolutely blew my mind to plant and soil
[SPEAKER_02]: science class that I started to understand
the relationship with nutrients and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything related back to what I was
doing and building soils and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding, Oh my God, that crop five
crops back where I had this issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was potassium, that was phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having calcium issues and it just
blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh, there is some validity to
this formal education business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, later on down the road,
I ended up in California growing and more
[SPEAKER_02]: soils were available, but I was never
happy with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were bringing things out, mixing,
trying to you know, find something that
[SPEAKER_02]: was consistent, which is the number one
issue I see with most soils out there is
[SPEAKER_02]: the consistency batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you build programs around something
that's not the same every single time
[SPEAKER_02]: became a really big challenge for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sustainability of peat moss became
a big concern for me as I started to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, done a lot of environmental work
and engagement over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was something that spoke to me
and like, Oh man, we got to stop draining
[SPEAKER_02]: wetlands, releasing all the carbon,
like this isn't serving the purpose that I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to serve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cocoa fiber became the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned that there's a cocoa fiber
company being started locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was at the gross store and saw a
bag of Royal gold, clear bag with a
[SPEAKER_02]: sticker on it, it was just like broken up
bales of cocoa shoveled into a bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: hand sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a gentleman named Chip had
started the company at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was like, Oh, I know him from,
you know, being in the Hills and trim in
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went and got a job there,
ran the research gardens for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that same time, the current owner
of Royal gold Chad was there and we hit it
[SPEAKER_02]: off and, you know, had a vision together
along the way of how much better it could
[SPEAKER_02]: be and how we could improve the soil
industry as a whole through better
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, better understanding,
better consistency, SOPs, because we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to improve our grows and we wanted
to improve other people's grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really where it caught for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so much respect to Chad and
really chip both.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me a platform to chase my
passion and, you know, got to work in
[SPEAKER_02]: research and development, helped do a
bunch of the research for Tupper,
[SPEAKER_02]: helped lead the Kings Mix research team,
blending up hundreds of different.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much has Kings Mix changed over the
years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some minor changes in the
amendment package from the first couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years, and there's been some changes as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started to have to hold our suppliers
more accountable for their products,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically perlite cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what you got from these big suppliers
wasn't the same every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had to hold them to that higher
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, look, we're taking core samples
of our perlite totes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at, look at this core sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these fines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cocoa was all over the board with salt
content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to learn how to buffer it
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we rinse, grind, buffer, looked at the
science like, okay, this is what makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when it's within reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when it's outside of acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just honed those SOPs a bit at a
time, a bit at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those changes that you've seen in Kings
Mix have largely been just improvements in
[SPEAKER_02]: raw materials, more than a specific recipe
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which again, it's all about consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we call something something and
create an expectation, we want it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want you to be able to do the same
thing with it every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feed it day three, we want you to
feed it day three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you guys used to have an organic,
I mean, I still consider your product
[SPEAKER_05]: organic, even though it doesn't say
organic on the bag anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys used to be organic on the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said natural and organic, and that's a
state labeling issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're allowed to say and how
you're allowed to say it in labeling is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fricking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Age old, same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite product.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've learned it's about cleanliness,
not about these certifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: What testing for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter about the name for me as
much as it does the end result.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, it's something I
feel good about consuming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel good about my friends consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may not be certified organic in
your breeding programs, but your products
[SPEAKER_02]: are clean and you're making sure it's
consistent and up to your own standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to call my stuff
organic, even though a lot of it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that certification, if somebody is an
actual certified organic farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they have to use certified organic
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of that, I mean, a soil company
with its own lab testing all of its
[SPEAKER_00]: batches, doing all of its hourly
production samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep it up to a year to reanalyze it if
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't think anybody out there is
going through the kind of level of
[SPEAKER_00]: accountability and quality control that we
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of organic products out
there that have tons of contaminants
[SPEAKER_02]: because because it says organic on the bag
doesn't mean there's not pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fungicides, herbicides, and other
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take chicken manure out of a
regular chicken farm, compost it down,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now it's organic composted chicken
manure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those chickens were fed all sorts of
crazy things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's miticides for their feathers that
get the birds get treated with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That all goes into the litter,
all gets composted down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are persistent organic pollutants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we audit our raw materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really at the beginning of 1964
when they started rolling out all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: new cannabis testing guidelines that were
like, okay, well, we need to test our soil
[SPEAKER_02]: like these people are going to test their
flower to make sure that we're not failing
[SPEAKER_02]: people, that they depend on us and we
depend on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a lot of that going on too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_05]: People failing their tests because of
their soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And buying so much soil that it broke
their company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that happen twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their company got broken from heavy metals
specifically in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first outdoor farm in Oakland
is out by the water and it was from the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they bought shitty soil and they got
shitty results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sometimes is in the native soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an industrial wasteland right
around the bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in the smog?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even like Salinas and Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all these people were growing flowers
and different crops that you could spray
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of pesticides, herbicides,
fungicides, toxic, toxic business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It then accumulates in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 30, 40 years later, we're going
to grow cannabis and people are failing
[SPEAKER_02]: their testing from what people did
literally a generation earlier that will
[SPEAKER_02]: always be in that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we service a lot of farms that would
like to grow in the ground, but they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: because their ground is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of contaminated soil,
especially ag land.
[SPEAKER_00]: DDT is still detectable everywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been banned since the early
seventies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big part of that whole organic
versus clean conversation that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: really been driving for 16 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel like our entire, my entire
existence at this company has always been
[SPEAKER_02]: waging an education campaign about why
cocoa is better, why this is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, we're just trying to
elevate all ships together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coming from a community where
we're all growers, our communities are
[SPEAKER_00]: yours, our kids go to school with,
you know, other kids whose parents are
[SPEAKER_00]: also growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just so interconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the thing that I loved about the
company the most was that it seemed like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and still to this day, if something comes
up where it becomes apparent that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe do it better, we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always like, let's make sure this
never comes up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it happens once, one time,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a, you know, it's a bigger particle
gets through and it comes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes in as a complaint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to figure out how to,
you know, make an extra layer of screens
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, put a magnet to collect,
you know, a screw or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every, every single time for the last
12 years, since I've been with the
[SPEAKER_00]: company, it's like every single thing that
becomes apparent that we can fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how you do one thing is how you do
everything and you start falling off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I think it comes down to
intention and that's one thing I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about intention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Consciousness, you know, at the end of the
day, it's like a conscious living and
[SPEAKER_05]: being conscious of the choices and the
decisions you make around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being aware is half the battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is to educate and learn and
better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And try to make the right decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, things that we thought were
right 20 years ago, weren't right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The margarine and the butter debate over
the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like so much stuff though,
like in seed oils now that's the big,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you avoid seed oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed oils are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife, every, every time that she
listens to a podcast and it reverses and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the oil that we just bought over the
last two months is now in the trash and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing, going a different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that's just changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every two months, the only thing constant
has changed pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just do your best every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we can really aspire to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, you know, try to have fun doing
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think not taking life too
seriously in some ways, but being serious
[SPEAKER_05]: about whatever you're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's one of the biggest
lessons that cannabis taught me is to slow
[SPEAKER_02]: down, enjoy that moment, use it to reflect
and move forward in a better way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis really lets you see your true
self.
[SPEAKER_05]: It lets you look in the mirror and see who
you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's one of the beauties of
it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the real smokers, you really smoke,
you're looking at your true self and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why some people don't like smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a little scary to delve through
our past traumas and we all have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all been through things that we'd
rather not admit, rather not remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: but confronting them face to face and
learning from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, every experience from the moment
you're born puts a filter over your eyes
[SPEAKER_05]: of that experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, that makes you who you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that can be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of that can be bad, but we all have
past trauma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's one of the beauties of being
able to do psychedelics and smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like you can lift some of those
filters back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can lose some of that ego and ego is
built off of that whole layers of filter
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so if you can lift those off and
see the world, how it truly is,
[SPEAKER_05]: it can be really eyeopening.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be really scary, but it's also a
great way to live when you're seeing the
[SPEAKER_05]: world as it truly is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts you more in the moment a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about presence and living in the
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Giving presence, making people happy and
your friends around you, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, yeah, life's short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny that birds of a feather
flock together in this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you, you start to instantly
connect with those people that feel that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like we've been crossing paths
probably for 15 years in the industry in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, but we didn't really
officially meet till last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instantly we were like, just hit it
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no pretext to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, wow, I appreciate what you do
and where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, 45 minutes later,
even though there were tons of people
[SPEAKER_02]: crowding around, coming after you for
seeds, we were just like chit chatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I really respect that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny how like there's, there's
alignment with people and like,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have a bunch of mutual friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, that's how the industry is as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like all the people I meet,
I'm constantly meeting new people and a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of them, even though I don't know
them, I'm friends with friends that people
[SPEAKER_05]: they've known for 10 or 15 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've known those same people for 10 or
15 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Catchmaster Alex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great example of somebody like,
I didn't know him till he was on the
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked a couple of times on the
phone, but him and I have a handful of
[SPEAKER_05]: mutual friends that have been friends for
a long time with both of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and we just never really crossed
paths, but like him and I hit it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, we talk about it a lot,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The web that's been created through
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, 20, 30 years,
like it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That separation, it's small these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you get into talking to anybody
in the cannabis industry, at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good luck getting 10 minutes in
before making that connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wait, you know, you live where?
[SPEAKER_05]: Letting out breeders and growers is
actually, it is fairly easy because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: connections and because we're all so
interconnected, even on an international
[SPEAKER_05]: scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only a handful of people at the
top and doing this stuff on a commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: level as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a breeder, I'm, I can't imagine
that that's a really unique place to be
[SPEAKER_02]: connected into the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through and, you know, looking at,
you know, some of the giants, the Somas,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jack Herrers, like those people
defined the industry for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even before we knew what the industry was
or where it was going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I never met Soma,
but I was lucky enough to meet Jack a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just talked about it on the last
podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's quite the character and a
really good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like family.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for me as a kid, when I was
cultivating, looking at his Soma beds and
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on all organics and breeding it
himself, I was a dreadlock hippie.
[SPEAKER_05]: All you need to do is fly to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go hang out with someone.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd love to meet you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very inclusive of people in the
community, especially if you like smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: is the one thing that I can guarantee
that's going to happen when you get a
[SPEAKER_05]: Somas house is you're going to smoke a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sign me up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a nine foot long beard at one point
and you know, 17 foot long dreadlock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreads at one point and 50 some odd cats
and he has the most amazing house and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was the inspiration for me before I
met him as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I knew his genetics before and he's
just all around character.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd love to go back over there
and visit Amsterdam again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'll probably go sometime this
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you guys want to go out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: The food is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that city.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We even in the summer, it's cold,
not cold, like the winter, but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco or humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been over there of all the
years of watching and participating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never made it so that we'll have to
stay in touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went for the high times cup in 2003 and
spent like nine days running a little
[SPEAKER_00]: house on the canals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canals are cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: The city is just a trip and there's really
good people there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a lot of friends there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot of fun.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got to do Spannibus if you don't,
you haven't done Spannibus in a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spannibus is it's time to do Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's top of the list as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just next year you got to do
Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have a dinner party we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do the dinner party once a year and we
have a lot of fun, but everybody has
[SPEAKER_05]: dinner parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of dinner parties, a lot of good
food and a lot of good events and just a
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing, amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been talking about it since before
the pandemic and obviously not having the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to get our soils overseas
definitely makes it a little interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as trying to figure out where's the
worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than being an international brand,
getting your branding out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: half the people that go there,
obviously from the States, from what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard, we are opening up a facility
currently in South Carolina, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change the direction of the
company going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'd love to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how many inquiries we get
from over there, people wanting our
[SPEAKER_02]: product, but shipping soils around the
globe is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really necessarily make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as we'd love to service those
people, that's not necessarily the best
[SPEAKER_02]: decision for all of us.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have facilities buying our
product now and paying more to ship it
[SPEAKER_00]: than the actual cost of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they're doing it and they're
excited about the fact that they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able just need to a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're looking at like some time in
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to be up and running and
producing out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we have a lot of excited
customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like buying bricks from Italy to
build your house.
Right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds really cool, but you know,
it's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if guys are looking for you,
where can they find you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find our podcast Royal Grown

[SPEAKER_00]: of assist.

[SPEAKER_02]: After 16 years of doing it, we're trying
to just do something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And interesting.
