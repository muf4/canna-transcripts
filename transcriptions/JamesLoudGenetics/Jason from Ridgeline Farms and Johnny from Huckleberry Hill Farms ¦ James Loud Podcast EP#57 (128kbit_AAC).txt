[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, our special guests are Jason
from Ridgeline Farms and Johnny from
[SPEAKER_03]: Huckleberry Hill Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys know this,
but I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: of yours, both of yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys do a lot of good stuff on
Instagram and online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your genetics are world renowned.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been winning Emerald Cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the White Thorn Rose,
which has been on my radar for the last
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I tried it was last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with Mila.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went up to Bell's to Heritage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she gave me some purple rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And totally amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Sam from Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made some rosin cards of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you having and we're a
big fan of you and your podcast and really
[SPEAKER_00]: how you educate the people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important, especially for
small farmers like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really appreciate you having us
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are just killing it up and
humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've been winning Emerald Cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been, but now I'm battling against
this guy, you know, so which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup does a lot for us,
small farms, just like you having us on
[SPEAKER_02]: this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have to be represented.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, we don't have big
advertisements and marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important for our brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you guys are like forming the humble
Voltron right now, combining efforts and
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some genetic work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, you know, it's, I mean,
I guess we might as well get into now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's just what we're figuring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really important to separate
ourselves from, you know, these other
[SPEAKER_02]: brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing that, it's, you know,
having our own strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think just as important
it is to highlight our legacy strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: really having a partner to work with that
you can trust, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's key to keeping those
genetics in house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm giving, you know,
the white thorn rose to Jason,
[SPEAKER_00]: who shares it with his dad to do these
breeding projects, it's really nice to not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about it walking away and
then the world having it, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what's unique to our farms up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the small farmers don't,
you know, have a whole lot to pivot on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those legacy genetics are something
special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a handful of them left up
there that you can only get up and humble
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been around forever that haven't
really made it to the masses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're pretty, you know,
there's like everybody asks Sativa,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and at this point, a lot of that
has been mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of hybrids, but back to that
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I came up, you know,
out of the Lance and he has a white thorn
[SPEAKER_02]: rose and we've been working together,
me and Johnny, you know, it's such a
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated, you know, the whole weed
world, it's really hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really nice to have somebody to
work with through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we cross these strains this
year and you never know what you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you cross strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lottery involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lottery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, I mean, we've found multiple,
a few that are just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is, it's just exciting for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we've been growing weed our
whole lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, you know, it's,
you kind of, you get, not bored,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, you know, certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just growing the same ice cream
cake over and over and over, OG over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over, like what we did for years,
it gets boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we actually have the trust of the
consumers to grow our own strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyways, we put these two strains
together and now we're going to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: magic, you know, for all these consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fired up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lance is really special too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to tell us about the Lance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lance is, you know, it's a green
lantern.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one that, you know, it was the
first licensed Emerald Cup, sun grown
[SPEAKER_02]: competition, you know, and it won.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was scared shitless, you know,
sorry, language on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can see what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden it was up on stage,
you know, from an outlaw hiding to all of
[SPEAKER_02]: a sudden cameras in your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won with that green lantern and
continued the next year just to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we did pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got three, you know, three out of the
top 10 and first with the Ridgeline runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're two really good strains and
crossed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I went through a bunch of
Fino hunting for a year or so and picked
[SPEAKER_02]: this one that was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sure until I actually got to
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoked it, I'm like, Oh my gosh,
this is the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and to make it even more special,
you know, I still do my, we're old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: We aren't really using the high tech,
you know, I still cross or make crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: with my dad up in the Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we literally have a mail and we
shake the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fall in on the plants and we Fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did this with my dad and came out
with this strain that is just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's checking all the boxes in
the market, which is pretty hard nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're competing with the indoor
market with a sun grown product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, you know, it's,
and as I've learned it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the sun grown, I also do mixed light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's like everyone
that strain tastes different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under the sun and under the lights,
it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's, it's, yeah,
it's kind of hard to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is better?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, it gets bigger and it's
the THC is higher and it's stronger under
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun, just pure sun grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under the mixed light, it,
the flavor, the turps pop way more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's really strange on how,
you know, as you know, plants work
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are more indoor plants, you know,
it's something, so I'd get strains from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, other brands that are like,
they're more indoor strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll try them outside and it's
just, they don't, you get these tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: little popcorn buds, you know,
every once in a while you get one that
[SPEAKER_02]: loves the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tell us a little bit about your
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do it in a, what, what style
greenhouse are you guys doing greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just have, I mean, the mixed
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, regular, like my, Ridgeline Farms
is, I mean, we pull tart by hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's old school, you know,
the sun's the light and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the one lighter in the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and then our other one,
we, you know, we have, we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, lights in there and,
you know, it's also, it's, it's old
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying Foch lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing Foch lights in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those Fluence lights, you know,
the Fluence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like I said, it's,
it's really not fancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are, I go to all these facilities,
including yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look around and I'm like, well,
we are old school, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the weed doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, the plant doesn't
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like what you put into it is
what you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the experience plays a key role in that
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more times you've done it,
the repetition, man, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're passionate about it,
it makes it even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's dive into the White Thorn Rose and
let's get into a little bit of the history
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really stumbled upon the White
Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of took a different
approach to the legal industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: not really, you know, being in the
traditional market for 40 years and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, transferring over to the
regulated market was really weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: like he was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, initially started growing
commercial strains and then realized for a
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 square foot sungrown cannabis farm
in Southern Humboldt really wasn't going
[SPEAKER_00]: to amount to much and wasn't going to be
the pathway forward to allow me to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue doing what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we started really breeding
to a strain I used to grow with my mom
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that strain was called, back then it
was called Fruit Loops and changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: name to Paradise Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my mother's honor, we breed all
the different genetics to the Paradise
[SPEAKER_00]: Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a lemon OG from a really good
friend of mine that I respect and trust a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bred that to the Paradise Punch and
ended up with, we were growing back with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds then when the marketplace really
allowed us and, you know, White Thorn Rose
[SPEAKER_00]: could look a little bit different,
but we found two different phenotypes of,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, that same cross, one we call
Mom's Weed and one we called White Thorn
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, through Bell at Heritage
Mendocino really discovered that it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good washer and really uplifted
that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, at that point, took a life
of its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is maybe 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just started winning awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started working with more
manufacturers like Rozentech and Punch and
[SPEAKER_00]: iPoppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they all fell in love with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really familiar with the Roz
and world and stuff, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're educating me and really found
that, especially last year, it won four
[SPEAKER_00]: out of five first places at the Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, now we can only, we don't even
have the ability to grow enough on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grow 90% of the farm is White Thorn
Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually have another farm,
a guy I grew up with that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: growing White Thorn Rose for us too,
just trying to get it to as many people as
[SPEAKER_00]: we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a limited amount in my own jars
and the rest goes to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin or Hash Holes or whatever these
manufacturers want to create with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just think it's really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing quite like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a creme rosé Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's creme rosé from aficionado times
Skittles that my friend Tim up in Seattle,
[SPEAKER_03]: or he lived in Squim.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives in Squim now, but a can of
organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me the cut and he had the cut
and he'd grown flower of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had grown some flower of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was rosewater turps with, it was like
candy rosewater turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first time I tried the White Thorn
Rose was the first time ever that I got
[SPEAKER_03]: something that was close to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the White Thorn Rose is
more like flower petals.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the petals and it is just like
fresh rose petals and it's sweet and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: complex and it really checks the boxes as
far as if you like flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's not for everybody,
but it's something that I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's something that I look
forward to getting access to and being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to smoke every time I've got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I smoke it and then I'm sad that
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in this day and age, it's finding
something that's different and unique is
[SPEAKER_02]: just amazing because there's so many
strains, I'd say 80, 90% of similarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all gelato, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you get the gas, you know, or you have
like the lemony, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you find something like that,
it's like, it sets itself aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to have the flavor, like I said,
you could grow most strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could smell a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like put it in the grinder, do one
twist, smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way if you taste it, when you
smoke it, that's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to find that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it smokes down to the roach like that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I noticed when I first smoked
it was all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after you pick up the roach and it's
been sitting a day, it still tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly almost like the first few hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm super excited to see where
it goes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some little cool projects in the
works that haven't been finalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really just ultimately at the end of
the day for us, it's about touching as
[SPEAKER_00]: many people as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say this, that money doesn't
make people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about those consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time in our life that we've
ever been able to share what we do for a
[SPEAKER_00]: living with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a weird way, we've needed some
kind of validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have been doing for so long is
really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's those consumers that we
interact with that really give us
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we've been missing for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of brings us all together from
people from all walks of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: That love the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like food in the same sense and wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The social aspect of it is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take people that don't even speak
the same language and they can bond over
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have met in this last
eight years since this legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're here right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different people that
we've come together because of the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many really passionate people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the people that are really
passionate are just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they love the plant and it's part of the
life that they live and the lifestyle that
[SPEAKER_03]: they live.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just based around cannabis,
but cannabis is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can only imagine, you know,
I always try to put myself in somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else's shoes and being a consumer that
maybe isn't as familiar with cannabis as
[SPEAKER_00]: we are and watching all of us and all the
people in the industry running around,
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be really confusing for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do you know who's real and who's
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's real and what's true and what's
a lie and what's money motivated and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's authentic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just imagine it's pretty, pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they're starting to figure out
what the difference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're resonating to a lot of
small farmers in the emerald triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been getting a lot of that lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been getting hit up by a lot of
different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to carry craft legacy brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means so much because it's like,
you know, we're I'm actually take pride
[SPEAKER_02]: that we probably have the smallest growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the biggest rose in all of
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet our brands are known and people know
us and people want to smoke our herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that alone is like it feels pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't wait for interstate
commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people in other states will be able to
try Humboldt flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like Humboldt is so important
to the rest of the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a lot of the legalization and
a lot of the flower and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: outlaws and boundary pushers came from
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they've been smoking Humboldt flour
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everywhere.
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interstate commerce will open that
back up to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's only a small
percentage of the guys left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about this the other day
with the guys from Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that could open back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many people that are
passionate up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the ecosystem and the economy up
in Humboldt for the longest time revolved
[SPEAKER_03]: around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really it's like my dad,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that kind of that era.
[SPEAKER_02]: This pushed them out because they can't
grow their 15, 20 plants to make a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just basically worthless for them
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of era has kind of pushed
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're watching what, you know,
he's always tripping on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll come to my farm, look around,
be like, this is nuts, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though it's not that big for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was hiding in the hills growing,
you know, 10, 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, here we are at the field of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so what you were saying is,
you know, it was the weed growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: really didn't rely on the states or the
government to to help out with building
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all donated money and built the schools
in the hills, built the volunteer fire
[SPEAKER_00]: departments, built the technical rescue
teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was us that built this really hidden
community that was really had to rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: one another with their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a big family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when people come to Humboldt,
any actually the Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Trinity Mendocino in Humboldt
County, they always say, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we came here for the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found after being here for a
while, it's the people here that are
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this family feeling that you get when
you're around, like everybody actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cares about one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, the price went from five
thousand a pound to five hundred a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not we're having a harder
time supporting those fire departments
[SPEAKER_00]: that we built up in the technical rescue
teams in the schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really hard for us to see
those different facilities starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer and doors starting to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we have seen the end of
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it slows down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty sad right now to see
what's happening in the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd love to see the winery model
where you can go to the farm and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: taste the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could talk to the cultivator or the
breeder or both, you know, where just like
[SPEAKER_03]: Laganitas has for their brewery,
where you go on tour, the brewery and you
[SPEAKER_03]: get the story of how they evolved into how
they are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, then you get to sample
stuff potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think watching people
harvest plants in the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that would be such a
beautiful thing for places like Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: and Mendocino that, you know, really kind
of put those counties on the map,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in a lot of ways, especially for
our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, like the wine model,
hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sign up for a once a month gift
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what I want?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a can of country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a hogwash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ridgeline farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe they intermix the different jars
and once a month in their mailbox,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get, you know, different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they order it or maybe we just,
they trust the farmers to send them what's
[SPEAKER_00]: new and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing it with seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people love monthly membership boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that's a great way for
people to try all new products and test
[SPEAKER_03]: out stuff, you know, with your consumer
base that you know already likes the
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing that with seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing that with seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a monthly membership,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to find a way to be able to make
weed, you know, or be able to have an age
[SPEAKER_02]: better like wine though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's the one problem we can have
2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and I think it's a product that needs
to be consumed fresh, but I do have ways
[SPEAKER_03]: we can talk about this after the show,
where you can preserve the life of it for
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turplock bags are one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge fan of Turplock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went from using mason jars for my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we always had mason jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have tons of them still at the house,
but I went from mason jars to Turplock
[SPEAKER_03]: bags because you can preserve the flower
so much longer and maintain freshness.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, farm cuts got a pretty unique
way of, you know, preserving some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: turpenes and cannabinoids with,
you know, minimal trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also, you know, vacuum seal their
jars, which is a, you know, a step up
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, the turkey bag thing that
that's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turkey bag thing sits in your house
for a day or two and that that flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and temperature plays such a crucial
role if you're, you have temperature
[SPEAKER_03]: swings that goes, go up and down,
you're going to have issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can maintain a cool
temperature, it'll stay fresh a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and now that we have so much more
access, like I have 50 different flavors
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I usually smoke is what's the
best, whatever the best is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people ask that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask all the time, you know,
you know, what's the best flower and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, I want to say, and it's
just really my answer is, what makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good might not make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all made up differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our endocannabinoid system is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, um, maybe, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these turpenes will interact with
you better than they will me and make you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel amazing or heal whatever ailments you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the funnest parts about
making these crosses though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I've been doing all this,
this cross, make all these crosses with
[SPEAKER_02]: Lance right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have all the little paper bags,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And every evening I'm trying a new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I smoke these OG ones are
super potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a double OG chem cross when a rebel
groans and across with Lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, all of a sudden I'll work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go up pot plants till eight at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could smoke, you know, the secret one
that me and him did here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that, that we'll talk more about,
but it's like that one there chills me out
[SPEAKER_02]: in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go more sedated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Relax and go eat dinner and go watch a
movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's just, it's amazing what
each one of these strands will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just really fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to actually use the
creativity of it now, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause like I said, for our whole life,
it was, you know, it was our job,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we grew for money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, I hate to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they want to OG East coast one OG,
whoever wants OG, you're growing it for 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of doc OG floating around back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was easy, but now we get to,
you know, you'd have my dad, he'd pop his
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, you know, and it'd be POT just pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticky kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and he would sell it,
but that's not the deal anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just really fun to be able to
actually be creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, that's kind of our
passion is be able to make all these new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains now and just come up with,
you know, stuff that actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what the consumers would like,
you know, because it's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're sugar coating it a little bit
too, because as James well knows,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as you know, and I know for every
breeding project we do, maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I bred 20 different strains last
year and crosses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I think I came up with maybe
two that really passed the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: our standards and the rest just went to
the wayside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to find the diamond in
the rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when you do, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really been helpful for us is like
the animal, you could have the best strain
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world unless you have somebody
uplift that like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the animal cup, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of marketing and stuff,
but the Emerald Cup really propels that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best strain might not be the best
strain and nobody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're enjoying it, but you know,
that's everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give out the lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give out the lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, what would it
have been if I would have just sat there
[SPEAKER_02]: and smoked it by myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your best?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you consider to be your best
hottest strain right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hottest thing that I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, what are you most passionate
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I most passionate about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm most passionate about some of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're fino hunting right now,
but I got a blue dream LCG that we did
[SPEAKER_03]: some trials with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty special and it leans towards
the LCG, but it has like this crazy vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a blue dream is just a, it's a dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dream to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I got the Fort Collins
cough and I crossed out with the banana
[SPEAKER_03]: skittles and we got banana cough and it's
selling on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that one is really special to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I don't know if the whole world is
going to like it like I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like you got to look at it from
a chef's perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about what you love.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about what the customers love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can talk about the customers,
like babies give the baby what the baby
[SPEAKER_03]: wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, you know, I've done, I did 300
out-crosses last year and about 300 the
[SPEAKER_03]: year before.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't understand how much
work that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so much crazy work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and that's not even touching the
audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of flowers, you know, and I did a
lot of flower work as well, but I go
[SPEAKER_03]: through a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I work with house of cultivar in
Washington and we go through a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, we've selected 20
different phenotypes over the last year
[SPEAKER_03]: and a half of stuff that's been
phenohunted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some really cool modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like some of the throwbacks and I also
like some of the modern stuff that's
[SPEAKER_03]: slightly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not your typical run of the mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you guys are in the same
category with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't want the same stuff as
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need another gelato 33 or another
lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's going to be lemon cherry gelato,
a better pop and stand out, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some RS 11 crosses that I made are really
standouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I did some permanent markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a permanent midnight, which is the
permanent marker times lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of potential in
those that we're going through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we go multiple rounds of phenohunting
before we select and we test them in
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial environments as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, when we were talking
earlier, just the, the high techness of
[SPEAKER_02]: your, it's just crazy how you're figuring
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for us, you know, it's like
multiple years growing in all this
[SPEAKER_02]: different situations from indoors to mix
lights to outdoors, try to figure out what
[SPEAKER_02]: works better at my elevation to Johnny's
elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just hard to come up with a
strain that actually loves everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like I said, the Lance,
this, the taste is way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mix light, you know, but it gets
stronger outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, it's using your technology
with some of what we're doing would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably make it like way quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I got a Mexican gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the, it's got a Mexican haze
times gelato 41, and it's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not your typical sativa and it's
definitely not your gelato, but you get
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics of both of them in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are what I like where you're
like, Ooh, this reminds me of this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it also reminds me of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can really tell that it has both
of those things in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that excites me, but I'm constantly
excited by new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love going through phenos, but you see
these guys doing thousand seed phenohunts
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, that's great and all,
but I feel like you're really looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: unicorns at that point where I like going
through a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be able to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to be able to go smell bags all the
time or extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, you guess, you know,
if I could start, you know, six to eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 10 seeds of each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'll get a certain amount of
females out of it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: try them and there's, that's plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much work and so much money and
just basically investing a lot of time in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know, but then every once in a
while, it's like, if I smoke like a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good gassy one, it's nostalgic to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll bring me back to my childhood,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that foul gas, like that
really strong nose burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like dirt and you taste it on
your tongue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like resiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like that piney OG where you get the
piney and then it's real earthy and really
[SPEAKER_03]: brings you back to those ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It brings you back 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you're hiring the back of
the little, little pipe, little proto pipe
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Proto pipe from the nineties, you know,
or we had those pipes that you could mix
[SPEAKER_03]: and match the different pieces for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the resin chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would smoke the resin back in the day
because we were just, it was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you were saying before,
and I believe to be true is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that flower takes on the place
that it's been, it's being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I grow the white thorn rose at my
place, it tastes really totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you were to grow it at Ridgeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm on the west side that gets
a little influence from the ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's on the east side that maybe is a
little higher elevation, doesn't get as
[SPEAKER_00]: much fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both taste amazing, but we can tell
the difference just in the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the taste of the place is, I think,
really important to market and brand your.
[SPEAKER_02]: His stuff, his stuff buds away quicker
because his son goes, he has less sun down
[SPEAKER_02]: in the valley there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I bring it up to my house all of a
sudden, it's the first one budding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in fino hunting, we're always
looking for not just the flavor or the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the bud density or whatever,
you know, we don't want them to get
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we want it to be early finisher in
case the big storm comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: White thorn rose harvest is usually
September 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a huge advantage back in the
eighties with the paradise punch was a
[SPEAKER_00]: September 7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could dry it, cure it, get it into the
market, get a couple before camp comes or
[SPEAKER_00]: get it out into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the big harvest in Humboldt and get
two or $300 more a pound, which made a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the beautiful things
about the coastal regions of Humboldt is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is there so much powdery mildew and
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to test for resistance,
that's the best place to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put it out there and then select the
ones that don't have the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've been finding is so paradise
punch just will not get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown it in a room before amongst,
uh, you know, OGs that have totally
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew and it won't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anything I breed that paradise
punch to it really makes that strain
[SPEAKER_00]: really resistant to the powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I utilize it in that way a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am finding, or I'm believing I'm
finding not 100% sure yet that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, um, purple strange really are a
little bit more resistant to bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe hop late and not powder mold,
not powder mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not your purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: My purple is different than your purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like those, there, there's all
different levels to resistance too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just like resistant or not
resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are partially resistant and,
and, you know, we use a one to 10 scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have, you know, completely resistant
to the, you know, the complete opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's just super susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel the softness on some of those
plants and those are the ones that just
[SPEAKER_02]: mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll put cheetah piss right next
to the lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lance allows some powder mold that will
not go over onto that cheetah piss and the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf on the cheetah piss is really like
oily kind of tougher leaf, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a huge fan of cheetah piss
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows amazing about the smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a good smoke for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, is like on the vine it
smells like the ammonia, but I grew up
[SPEAKER_03]: with cat piss and so cat piss,
we're going for that ammonia and you want
[SPEAKER_03]: that when that translates into the smoke
where it's like strong and potent and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, that that's what I'm all about,
but it doesn't really remind me of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a good grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the good across,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, it's, it's fun to
grow in my area because it, or my climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it doesn't powder mold,
it gets giant and it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to say it in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what a lot of these, a lot of the
buyers want is something that looks
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't really, they don't want
powdery mildew in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that has breeding
potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talk about this a lot, but I feel
like purple punch, Oreos, they get a bad
[SPEAKER_03]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least I'm not a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I get hated for saying,
I don't like apple fritter, but apple
[SPEAKER_03]: fritter, I don't really like personally,
but I feel like they're all just one step
[SPEAKER_03]: away from being great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, you put the right cross,
you put the apple fritter with the purple
[SPEAKER_03]: punch and you can find amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how many crosses there are
nowadays, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is it to pick a name for a
strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's like, I can put loud on
the front of anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come up with a good name and I feel like
I want to do descriptive names,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we get creative with stuff,
but I like it to describe the plant a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe you just touched on
something that I was going to mention
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but you hit on it now is,
you know, you put James Loud or Loud on
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging and it maybe might not be
the most amazing strain or maybe it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most amazing strain, but you've built a
trust with that consumer and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to understand who you are and
your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're buying your flower because
of who you are in the trust that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: built with them, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same with us too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're starting to do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter so much what we grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much is the trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're putting it into our jars,
we're saying, Hey, we're, we're verifying
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the son of a mature
market, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that happening in Colorado and
Washington a lot more than it's been in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, but we're starting to go in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, you know, over, once the
market stabilizes, then they start,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're getting, you're getting consumer
trust where the, they trust the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then they're willing to try stuff
within the brand because they already
[SPEAKER_03]: trust it and they know you're going to
provide good quality products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're willing to, you know,
try a Skittles that you guys grow or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a customer for life then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the best, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, that's what you
want to do is get more customers that
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to buy your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people love our story too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, I think that's what
separates us for, there's so many brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when this whole thing started,
I mean, I've watched brands come and go
[SPEAKER_02]: left and right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, we aren't, you know,
spending tons of, I mean, I guess we do
[SPEAKER_02]: spend all the money we make on wheat
anyways, goes in our brand, but we're slow
[SPEAKER_02]: and steady and we're just being real,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, this is who we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is what we've done our
whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should be good at growing wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been our job for our whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were raised around wheat or
parents grew wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so, so yeah, I think that people
do, they're seeing our story.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeing what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting that trust and that's
freeing us to be able to have fun,
[SPEAKER_02]: go outside the box and have new strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I mean, for me, I need this
right now because I was getting kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: bored of just, you know, doing the same
thing over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having fun with it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it becomes an authentic experience
for you, but also for the consumer,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can see the authenticity,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they can attach themselves to the
story and relate to the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, yeah, people love a good story,
especially when it's authentic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause anybody can tell a story,
but an authentic story, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you start looking at it and it's like,
wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the trials and tribulations that
we go through and have gone through to get
[SPEAKER_02]: to this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to pay respect, you know,
even like Johnny's being a youngster and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, humble and watching his court
case and watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the biggest thing that happened
when I was a kid, you know, watching him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first one to, you know,
have a real national court case and it
[SPEAKER_02]: affected all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, we got to pay tribute to,
you know, everybody that paid my dad,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my uncle, his mom, you know,
there's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like a lot of that's getting
kind of washed down these days and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and forgot about, but there's a
lot of people that made it so we could do
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the beauty of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we talk about it every show
pretty much the oral history of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and the importance of it, but like guys
like Johnny that are revolutionaries that
[SPEAKER_03]: push the bar and we're boundary pushers
that really said, this isn't right that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care that it's illegal and I'm
going to do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need people like that standing up
to the government and standing up to
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are trying to argue the fact
that cannabis is illegal or mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_03]: bad for you or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, there's so much more
than money, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the brand I was just trying to
grow more weed than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as, as ridiculous as that sound,
there was a competition, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all of our friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, Oh, well he's doing this and
he's doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops are over here and the cops
are looking on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're growing in the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're looking in the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hollowing out bushes and growing
under the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a cat and mouse game in
a, in a fun, um, game between our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, who could grow more,
who could grow differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: What techniques aren't you getting busted
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like fishing kind of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be the, you know, you have a
clone room, you know, you could be indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could be outdoor and everyone kind of
does their own thing and rest their own
[SPEAKER_02]: ass, you know, however they want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember when we went from outdoor
to indoor and what that was all about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when, you know, after Ronald
Reagan, Reagan had declared the war on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs and they injected all this money
into the different counties to eradicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we're going to make an example
out of people to stop cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, most of us made it through
that and went into indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of us were also at the same time
growing outdoor and indoor cause we were
[SPEAKER_00]: pivoting from outdoor to indoor and we'd
grow outdoor in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd grow indoor in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd hang camouflage, radar detecting
infrared camo nets over there because
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody said it would help with the
infrared and whether or not it did or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like we were burying generators into
the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, one thing that I don't
think any of us could really foresee or
[SPEAKER_00]: overcome is when somebody rats on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's, that's a tough one
to swallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the way I ended up getting in
trouble and being naive, being a 20 year
[SPEAKER_00]: old kid, not knowing a difference between
state and federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't know I could ever be looking at 10
years to life in prison for a first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: not another offender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, did eight years in federal
prison and had five years probation and
[SPEAKER_00]: went to court for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 17 out of my life, 17 years out
of my life for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I'm a permitted farm with the
County and with the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really surreal what I feel
sitting here with you today, being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your audience about what I love to do and
what I still love to do and feel very
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in amazing time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're living in an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and you know, 20 years ago,
it was a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even 10 years ago is a whole different
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, legalization is only happened
since 2018 and we had medical,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they were still putting people in
prison, you know, for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: for small amounts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's, it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there's guys like yourself
that have been pushing boundaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had Richard DeLisi on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did 32 calendar years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people don't belong in prison,
especially for a long time for a
[SPEAKER_03]: nonviolent offense, you know, it's like,
and for cannabis, it's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to take that away from us is just
really silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, my parents' generation,
you know, they went back and forth on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my, my father's 74 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, they, they went back and
forth and there was some people from the
[SPEAKER_03]: sixties and seventies that were okay with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of people hating on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now a lot of those people are okay
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting how the narrative has
changed and people realize- Are your
[SPEAKER_02]: parents okay with it then?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my dad, my dad's the same age.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, my aunt was okay with it and my
parents were, my, my mom was kind of out
[SPEAKER_03]: always okay with it, but my father was not
really okay with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're okay with it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a time in maybe 2003,
they were coming to, they live in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived, grew up in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in Portland, but my parents
live in Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my father said, I'm coming to visit
and we're going to come visit for the
[SPEAKER_03]: holidays.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, ah, you know, we're going to be
real busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys don't want to come visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, oh, we're coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, I just want to let you know,
the garage is full of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, what do you mean the garage
is full of plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like didn't get it right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, the garage is full of
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh, and I'm like, so if you
want to come, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to let you know in advance
that the garage is full of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they came and he was actually
pretty impressed with the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I had 216 plants, which was,
you know, over the federal limit at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, but I was growing in octagons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys probably remember the old
octagons where you have a, we had cool
[SPEAKER_03]: tubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have your thousand Watts in the
cool tubes and you have 26 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's four tiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 13 plants per tier and the plants grow
towards the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy got it from a farmer up in
Humboldt and had the recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we spent the weekend cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's such a different world,
you know, or, you know, it's like being a
[SPEAKER_02]: kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sleeping when we actually made our
harvest and then get busted, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in our bedroom, there'd be plants hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to school with fucking wipe,
wipe, wipe the leaves off our back,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just such a different world,
you know, it wasn't a taboo where we came
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, everybody grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd just be quiet about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Bob Cork, my glass teacher
freshman year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I was 14 and 15 and I was a TA when
I was 15 for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he used to give me $50 at lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get an eighth of weed for 40 bucks
and two cheese zombies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was the best, he was the best TA
or I was the best TA.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the best teacher ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, really good.
And stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, you know, growing up in the Bay
Area, there's this connection to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Grateful Dead as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that plays a huge role.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got companies like Laganitas that I
talk about, you know, and think we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of the evolution of the dead to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the cannabis scene is part of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping our town could just get
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting really quiet right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really sad in our town
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the most beautiful place ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like every time, you know,
I saw you in San Francisco there on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up in the morning, I shot home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but it's just right now it's
just, it's taking a beating with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people that have been
outlaws their whole life are having a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: time playing with this new system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's pretty cutthroat out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always like to be positive
about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as, as hard as it is right now,
I really believe it's like a big puzzle on
[SPEAKER_00]: the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have to kind of figure out
this new industry by fitting the pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: together and you know, our legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: See genetics highlighting our stories have
really given us a lot of momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I always tell people,
I said, you know, I don't, I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: want you to buy my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to do is I want you to
grow your own because if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: truly understand our story and why we're
so passionate about what we do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to grow your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to start your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to grow, grow it throughout the
summertime and nurture it and take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: it and water it and feed it and then
harvest it, dry it, cure it, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with your buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you look over and you see
somebody smiling or laughing or healing
[SPEAKER_00]: some ailment that they have all because of
what you created, that's the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I need them to feel to truly
understand what we went through to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, there's, there's a,
there's something about growing your own
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and going through the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, popping seeds even, but like the
first time you take that plant through a
[SPEAKER_03]: life cycle, even if it's from clone or
seed, whatever, but you, you're with that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant through the veg and then through the
63.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 70 or however many days of flower and
you dry it and you smoke it and you think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the best thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least when I was younger, I remember
that with everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't,
but there's special attachment that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to that flower and to be able to
share it with other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I think everybody should
have to grow, whether it's tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, everybody should have their
hands in the dirt trying to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have that fire 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you why, because when I
walked in the door, the first thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: did was you grabbed those bag of weeds and
you shoved it in our face so we could
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it because you were proud of what
you created and what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the specialness that people
really need to understand and need to
[SPEAKER_00]: feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really like when I come to
my farm or Johnny's, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: look around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get, I know every single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at every single plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I touch every plant, you know,
I smell every plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole process to me is amazing all
the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm my worst critic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sit there and be like, this tastes
like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look across, across your property
and you'll see, you'll see a little leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: wilted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's my art.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like I said, at the end of
the day, when I'll smoke something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the first one that's the
most honest about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't like it, you know, it's like
this one's out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's definitely, I think that's
another reason why, you know, the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers trust us is because they know
we, we put so much into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we, we, I think that's the
advantage of not having acres and acres of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, maybe you don't have way
more, but we have what we have is way,
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we put so much energy,
every little project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did this pen project with Arcata X
and it's like, we're not going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: money, not for a long time, but we had so
much, you know, detail and just put the
[SPEAKER_02]: best, the best rosin into the best pen
and, you know, with amazing artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just did everything to a point
where the quality is, we'd be proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's kind of,
I think what's going to separate us from a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of other brands that are just pumping
out tons of stuff just to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make, make what they can make as cheap as
they can so they can make as much profit
[SPEAKER_02]: as they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, that's not really
where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, quality over everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think quality over everything
is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think quality needs to be the focal
point and, and the attention and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have to make money, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, we need to pay our
bills, feed our families.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's that aspect, but trying not
to sacrifice quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what I've been finding and I've
been learning as these manufacturers have
[SPEAKER_00]: been exploring, you know, White Thorn Rose
and this new Paradise Pine that we created
[SPEAKER_00]: was each of those manufacturers are kind
of like growers themselves is they have
[SPEAKER_00]: their own techniques and that product that
they're creating comes out totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why Bell from Heritage is
known as one of the best hash makers or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Brianist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they take so much passion in what
they're doing and it really transfers into
[SPEAKER_00]: that product that they're creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, whether or not you
smoke that or you experienced that from
[SPEAKER_00]: punch or heritage or Rosentech or iPoppy,
they each taste a little bit of different,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a reflection of those people that
actually created it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't pretend like I remember
people giving me like what you don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: about rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, I stay in my lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these guys have dedicated their
life to making the best rosin there is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I mean, that's what that's
the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's the beauty of rec
and one of the beauties of the direction
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've gone in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause back in the day, we did everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were electricians.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were carpenters.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a extra way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had bubble bags set up, you know,
and I did it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I even did a generator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're a mechanic too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you had to do a little bit of
everything back in the day and you didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily need to rely on anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wanted to be self-sufficient and now
we can really be specialists of our craft
[SPEAKER_03]: and we can really dial in certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not one of those guys that wants to
chase the next shiny object.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your seed thing is it's high tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way beyond what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, rubbing this plant, getting out
of the seeds, you have these machines and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're sitting there cleaning seeds and
you're making these, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your whole genetic library.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the beauty of that is that I can
share it with other people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have this seed cleaning
equipment that it's super scalable too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like we, we have it set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I have so many friends that
don't want to invest 80 grand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just bring their seeds here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We clean them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can rock it out, you know, and it's
like a one day thing rather than a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: week or two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a point where it took us two
weeks to clean seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 years ago or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could do all that in like,
and these are all the D grades.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like C and D grades that don't
germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, stuff that used to take us two
weeks now takes us a day, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: with automation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tools and equipment, but it's not
cheap, but at the same time it pays for
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at the labor on a week,
you know, this stuff, this stuff totally
[SPEAKER_03]: pays for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you guys see the future of the
industry up in Humboldt as?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be challenging for a
few years and it's looking a little bleak
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, but I believe it's going to
find its open door, its pathway forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that the small farmers
really need to focus on those legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that nobody else in the world has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's about marketing and branding
and educating the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that those Cherpene profiles
really resonate with them and they like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, off to the races.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really about our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think federal legalization is going to
highlight the stories of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle and really what created a
multi-billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be tough in the next couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our friends aren't going to
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really sad to both of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the biggest losses that
could occur with that is some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing farmers that are in the hills
right now might hold the key to having
[SPEAKER_00]: some cure for autism or some kind of
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with them going away, so might their
legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see genetics that might have that
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could be missing a big
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and with that side of it,
I feel like we're just scratching the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface and understanding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're further ahead of Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been doing trials for years,
curing ailments, working with the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: for stuff like ulcerative colitis and GI
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've cured something like 80%
of the cases of ulcerative colitis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Crohn's with cannabis, with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Jason always has stomach issues
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just, you know, talking the
other day, how Canna Country Farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good friend of ours up in Humboldt
County has a unique award winning
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, Canna Country 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just names all his strains just because
he has all these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is generally a lower THC,
super high in osamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jason was making tea out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really helping his stomach and
him sleeping at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, you know, we do have a
big uphill battle in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of it is, you know,
a lot of us, we don't like change,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been, it's old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like the stuff that me and
Johnny have had to go through to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: this point is a lot of change we've had to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we try to get a lot of our
friends, you know, come to podcasts to get
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews, you know, and a lot of people,
they're pissed, you know, they put their
[SPEAKER_02]: whole life into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of watching their,
you know, their culture slip away from
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think, you know,
it's going to, it's going to take a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if people stick with it and just don't
try to expand to the point where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing a bunch of crap, because there is
no room for crap on the market anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so if you just still grow really,
really good weed, you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just, you have to change a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you can't just sit back and
wait and watch it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is, this movement's
happening with or without you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was the first genetic that you
remember from Humble?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you, when you were up there,
what was the name genetic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you guys growing Colombian gold?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were growing the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember growing with my mom,
a strain called Fruit Loops, which was the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we crossed it with my mom's best
friend to a lavender Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we created the Fruit Loops.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's a weird name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that name too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the eighties or?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the early, early eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still a little obsolete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan obsolete, I believe was talking about
Fruit Loops as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't know if it was the best
strain in the world, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had its benefits where it was super
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested early and sold it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just about the weight,
you know, like orange crush, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the crinkle we had, you know, then we went
to the headband days and the white widows
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, some like white widows still
somewhere around there, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my favorite was the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardest one to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the beginning of low
yielding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just tiny, but we found ourselves,
you know, putting ice in the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: icing down the beds, watering it with
raspberry juice, turn purple, turn purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then there wasn't really many purple
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's why I was actually the
most excited with the Lance is cause I
[SPEAKER_02]: have a hint of that Urkel taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's pretty much one of my
favorite flavors, you know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was thinking these old strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And daddy purple and daddy was in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like the, your dad, what super
girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's, that's his, that's the one
he's been, he bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually harvests early basically
before the rains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think it's like this big,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really work on the market
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, you go to every one of my,
you know, friends, parents' house and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody would have a big bud in a glass
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grape ape and GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't, they're both purple,
but I don't think they're really related.
[SPEAKER_03]: We hear stories about them being,
you know, I mean, they're probably related
[SPEAKER_03]: to Urkel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, even Jack, you know,
or, you know, it's like Jack the old,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the old school Jack was fucking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it's not like the new Jack that we
really see very often.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last time I saw real Jack was in LA,
Brett from Terraform genetics was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: some old school Jack that was like really
pungent and strong and very, like very
[SPEAKER_03]: layered in terpenes and flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you smoke it and it's not just linear.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of depth to it and it was
strong and really, really strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's terpenaline, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be kind of fun to grab it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just limonene, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be kind of fun just to grab,
you know, we know so many old schoolers
[SPEAKER_02]: that have been holding seeds for 30 plus
years just to grab little packs and like
[SPEAKER_02]: do a little thing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I really wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this one that I remember getting
out of a little stash box that we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have maybe 12 or 15 seeds left.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine found it and he was
remodeling his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was behind the sheetrock and he gave
them back to me, but it was like one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite strains ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're like 40 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried all the techniques and
you know, the internet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely needs some advanced help,
but they were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I can remember, I wanted to ask
you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had mixed results with embryo
rescue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get past a certain point and there's
too many temperature swings and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a for sure thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping that it was because we had
some 20 plus year old seeds that we
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't get to germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Brothers, my partner Justin DSG
Labs, Apical Biotech, he did some embryo
[SPEAKER_03]: rescue, tried to do it with them and their
seeds just didn't pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh Freeman, he had some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried to do embryo rescue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't always work, but sometimes you
get lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we just had a little batch from
20?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like time capsule.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have enough seeds, a lot of times
you might find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like they cracked and maybe
there was a little tail, but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: mushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even tried to help it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one where if you can get a
tail, you really need some sort of embryo
[SPEAKER_03]: rescue to try to do it and it needs to be
in a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they need to do it in agar and a
petri dish and be able to add hormones to
[SPEAKER_03]: it to try to boost the life of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Blue Dream seeds that were really
old too and I loved them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most stable plant ever, the S1s,
you would get four phenotypes and you get
[SPEAKER_03]: one that was spot on Blue Dream and then
one that leaned towards the blueberry side
[SPEAKER_03]: and one that leaned towards the silver
side and one that was just not quite as
[SPEAKER_03]: good as Blue Dream that wasn't as big of a
yielder and wasn't as vigorous of a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those four, you don't see S1s like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see plants like that very often
that are so stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the market has turned into
just the classic purple bud and there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel that if you could find something
that's different right now, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear the cross that we did together is-
It seemed like the green crack in the Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreams and the Sour Diesel tried to make a
comeback last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that will- Oh,
they will eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everything comes full circle,
whether it's fashion or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's always going to be a
place, especially in my heart for OG Coach
[SPEAKER_03]: and for Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't really see the same Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk, we talk about it a lot,
but Skunk is another one where I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen it in a really long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking the other day with Mike and
Rick about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike was saying he believes maybe that it
was because everybody was growing from
[SPEAKER_03]: seed and that's why we were getting a lot
of those Skunk expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we're doing the clones more,
you're not really seeing it, but I have
[SPEAKER_03]: yet to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to see it one of these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even call it Skunk back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd go to Santa Cruz and pick up the
strawberry bud because it was strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: shaped nuggets.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was green bud and brown bud and then
people threw in some names.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is early 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the technology in this last five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, when I talk with you and your
book, you're showing me and what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just getting more advanced and more
advanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, eventually there will be that
library where you could just pick exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: how you want your strain to be and pop it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, I'm going to stick with old
school style.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes more time, but it's just
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking lots of notes I think is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from year to year, because that's
the thing is it's like wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: From year to year, you can grow the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then because of the environmental
differences from year to year,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can come out not completely different,
but it can definitely come out different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long, okay, so if you crack a seed,
you create a mother, you love that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a clone mother out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you think you can continue to
cut off that one cultivar before those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic really start to deteriorate?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the genetics are in the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a code.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that you can restore it through
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So DJ Short told me a cool thing back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's told me some wild stuff, but DJ Short
told me a cool thing a long time ago when
[SPEAKER_03]: I was super excited about tissue culture
in maybe 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bumped into him and I was like talking
about these, maybe it was 2012,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I was talking about Bill Graham kits
and tissue culture and how I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the future and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, in the hills, we don't use
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do is we put it in the sun and we
put it in the soil, in the real soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the dirt, in the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We let it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets the vibrations of the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow and then you take new cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so every year you regenerate that
plant and you're taking it from the
[SPEAKER_03]: fastest growing part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a lot of truth to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what happens is they deteriorate
over time from viral load, bacterial load,
[SPEAKER_03]: stress, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's epigenetic changes that
we're just now discovering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Gelato 33 plays a huge role in
that because there's 10 different things
[SPEAKER_03]: named 10 different things and they're all
either Gelato 33 or LCG.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG is another one that were like Philo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they tested and there's like 90
some different things with different
[SPEAKER_03]: names, but they're all OG coach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brain game, the name game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that rename game is just,
it's silly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I wanted to talk about Gorilla
Glue because that's a really special one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they did something special,
which was the exact opposite and very
[SPEAKER_03]: counterintuitive to the way I thought,
because we didn't share genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't want genetics to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't get my sour cut back in the
day unless you were part of the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we were breeding back in the
day, we didn't want to give our cuts out
[SPEAKER_03]: at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to the cup in 2013 in LA
when Gorilla Glue won and they were at the
[SPEAKER_03]: cup, giving out clones of Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the year Gorilla Glue just
changed the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite flavors.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like a peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like chocolatey.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Gorilla Glue was like chocolatey and it
had the gas and yeah, the real glue glue
[SPEAKER_03]: from back in the day was amazing,
but they gave it out of the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everybody had access to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened was Sour Diesel was
having problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus it was longer flowering and people
didn't want to have to wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks ugly too, unless you have the
right one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Gorilla Glue yielded really good,
maybe not as good as Sour, but it yielded
[SPEAKER_03]: really good, but it finished faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all the growers in Sonoma,
Mendo, Humboldt, they switched from
[SPEAKER_03]: growing Sour over to growing Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by giving it out, they made the strain
extremely popular, extremely well known,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it changed kind of the map of what was
going on, especially with Sour Diesel back
[SPEAKER_03]: then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Sour Diesel was like one of
the early vectors of Hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a time where literally it ruined
people with the Viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even know what it was,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had people that were burning down their
full indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ruining everybody's shit was dying
and it cost people a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of made everybody sick of Sour
Diesel right then.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Sour Diesel was the cash crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the one.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten years straight, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,800 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 4,800 a pound, 4,500 a pound for Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when Outdoor used to go for
that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Sour Diesel back in the day,
you used to open up the bag and it would
[SPEAKER_03]: punch you in the face with Sour Diesel
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it kind of funny too?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like our market depended on what
the East Coast loved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the funniest thing, how that
worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's where there was interstate
commerce back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't legal interstate commerce,
but that Sour Diesel was all going to New
[SPEAKER_03]: York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The OG too.
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the OG, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And OG has gone through renditions of
different OGs and headband.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was OG headband and then more recent
years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so many renames of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skywalker and the SFV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had Doc OG going around Humboldt
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a bigger yielder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of renames.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched on something that I think is
really important to talk about a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit at least, is that the way we grow or
the way we plan the season really for my
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and for a lot of the small farmers
has changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to hedge our bet and
take the least amount of risk possible
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing a strain that you've never grown
before, there's some inherent risk in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing a Sour Diesel that really harvests
in late October or mid-October adds an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra month and a half to your season,
especially in the Emerald Triangle where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get those early storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened with a lot of people
that stopped them from growing outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel was some of those big storms
came in early like they used to do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties and just wiped them out,
ruined their whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing a White Thorn Rose or some of
these earlier harvests that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting strains and not really putting
them in ground until mid-June really
[SPEAKER_00]: shortens your season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot less risk when you have a
shorter season with getting bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: getting whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the climate too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had times I was doing three runs outside
pulling a tarp for three runs and now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like two barely works.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the last two years, the weather was
freezing the first rounds and we're coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out with these tiny buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five years ago, they were like
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summer started super early and it went
on forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel, I hate to say this,
but it's starting to feel like the depth
[SPEAKER_02]: and outdoor are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the price wise of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all calling them depths.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I see is like everybody calls
everything depths and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes like starting to call it an
indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it looks like indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do really good mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better than indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with Favin and these under
canopies, I don't know if you guys have
[SPEAKER_03]: tried the under canopies yet, but yeah,
I'll hook you up with Bobby bags to get
[SPEAKER_03]: some under canopies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, I think they're a big game
changer for the smalls, especially,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also winter runs to be able to do
winter runs successfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've got these under canopies and
your flower gets purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones we, I think we harvested,
I don't know, a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they went through the tail end of the
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those runs are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower, the turps, they aren't huge
buds, but they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so something about that makes light is
giving it the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a harder than indoor and harder than
outdoor because you're sitting there
[SPEAKER_02]: playing with the full temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, we have to have propane.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a lot of humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's tons of
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's hard and it's expensive,
but the quality of the product is just
[SPEAKER_02]: insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think it's should be more
valuable than indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're making a little bit of
mistake by, you know, putting them all in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really need to be educating the
consumer about is that they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: different, unique to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mix light.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mix light are testing at like,
you know, from 24s to 28s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, my son grows their test.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're up in the 30 pluses constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that outdoor is unique to
itself and it's a little different than
[SPEAKER_00]: mix light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't have mix light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tests alone are showing, you know,
way higher THC with just the sun grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so growing up, I love ugly weed,
too, just as much as I love good looking
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost feel like the consumer,
if they like it, they don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: need to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be about the flavor and the
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people are focused on the way
it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be great to be able to ever happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it'd be great to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have pre rolls here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be great to have the consumer
trust your brand enough to where they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't care what it looked like because
they're buying pre rolls and they love pre
[SPEAKER_03]: rolls because of the convenience of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's consistency with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, some of the
best stuff, some of the best stuff that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't necessarily pick as winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even with phenol hunting,
I give out joints now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really let, I mean, I know what
good stuff looks like, so I don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: need to share that with everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I give them pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it puts everybody on the same field,
like even playing field so that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get, I mean, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the THC, if it didn't even say the
THC, it was in a black jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't even see it, what it looks
like or in a pre roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let them taste it and test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how they feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, like the 26 is what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 16%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smoke it and get super high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like CBD actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 20 to one on a hogwash's gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it gets me loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think we were referring to it
being good because back in the days we
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking for that rock hard OG looking
bud because it was easy for the trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made it good because they were all
super happy and they weren't really mad at
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It weighed heavy, so the pounds weren't
like the white thorn rows that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can barely get it in the turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was good for the grower because
you got more weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were some of the things why I
referred to back in the day that made it
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was an amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got you really stoned, but having those
other few little traits to it really made
[SPEAKER_00]: it good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are picky these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are super picky and they're not
picky about the stuff that truly matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the buyers are not smoking the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basing it off of looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably just looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks 90%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think price is good, but those are two
different customers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's the guys that don't
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want the cheapest, the cheap,
and they smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like the real smokers too,
the guys that smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the guys that don't care
what the price is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want the best shit possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're two totally different
consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's a movement happening
though, because I said this earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been hit up more probably than ever
in this last few months about people
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting that craft farm herb on their
shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always try not to push it and just
sit back and let it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it happens, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this my whole life,
so it's not the end of the world if it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think people are starting to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're starting to understand 99% of
the weed is just weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the special stuff where
you put great stuff into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feed it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a unique strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one that you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make you feel different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the problems is the
distribution model that needs work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we need a fresh product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other podcast right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could do a whole other podcast on the
distribution model in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I feel like it doesn't matter how
good it is, if they don't get to it for
[SPEAKER_03]: six months and it's not stored correctly,
it's going to be trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing, marketing, marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So marketing, but also being able to get
to a store where people buy enough of it
[SPEAKER_03]: to where it stays fresh, where you can
just constantly be restocking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to where they get that after it's been
harvested, they're getting it within six,
[SPEAKER_03]: eight weeks at the very most.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we, as being small brands,
not being able to have tons of marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: or marketers, it's really hard for us to
get on these shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going against these companies
that are just buying shelf space.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're filling the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, I'm scared to actually package
a bunch of my sun grown because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to take a giant hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs so much to put it in the
packaging, to do the artwork, the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to be able to get more product on
the shelves and actually be paid on time,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it's like I would actually package
way more of my herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a battle and it's something we need
to work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many things we need to work on
in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the over taxation has killed a lot
of businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some kind of allure to
having a limited batch, maybe numbering
[SPEAKER_00]: your jars saying, look, I'm going to put
25 pounds this year of the Lance or the
[SPEAKER_00]: White Thorn Rose in my jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be the only amount
that's going to be in this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're lucky enough to get it,
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, then maybe you have to wait
till the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big section in my book about it
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe what I believe the
distribution model should be with
[SPEAKER_03]: refrigerated trucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some people doing it now,
but dispensaries with refrigeration to
[SPEAKER_03]: where they store it correctly,
trucks that bring it to those dispensaries
[SPEAKER_03]: that store it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you control it right from the farm
and it goes all the way to the consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's stored correctly, that's half
the battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point because once it
really people need to understand is once
[SPEAKER_00]: it leaves our farm, we transport it to our
manufacturer who puts it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they leave it in the sun or however
they end up treating it, maybe more so as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, sometimes I think people
could end up with something that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, wow, this isn't cured that good
or it wasn't taken care of very good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they need to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing until it left our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to find partners all
the way down the supply chain that treat
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like you said, refrigeration trucks
and deliver it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just putting our brand out there,
you know, it's like people look down and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah, I work with cookies,
but look at how many people they've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that trust cookies that won't
trust our small brands, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they'll actually buy my product for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like sometimes you have to just
you work with people and they they have
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing marketing and they have basically
what I'm saying is all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_02]: get our product into people's hands that
would never have smoked our weed before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they smoke it and they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a battle for us to be able to
get to that point.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need help.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are great for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having great guests like yourself,
you know, and you guys are the heart of
[SPEAKER_03]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my podcast, just all these great
guests that I get.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes this podcast great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like I may be the
facilitating and hosting it, but at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the day, it's really all these
great guests with their stories and
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't go for just one type of guest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a little bit of everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get revolutionaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all revolutionaries in some way,
you know, but I think just just working
[SPEAKER_03]: with the plant makes us special.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it, man, because it's like I
said, this is how we could get our story,
[SPEAKER_02]: get our name, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you guys deserve the platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's for your area deserves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the funny thing is me and Johnny,
we're doing our best to represent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like, gosh, there's so many good
people, so many amazing farmers in our
[SPEAKER_02]: area that they deserve just as much credit
as we do, if not more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't had that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't had the call from James.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next generation, the next up
and coming generation, man, we got to set
[SPEAKER_03]: an example for the kids that are coming
behind us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because I feel like we're on the
shoulders, especially us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're on the shoulders of giants
like yourself, guys that did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a responsibility that
we have to the plant and to the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that came before us to really tell the
true story, be authentic with what we do
[SPEAKER_03]: and to be able to pass the plant on in the
way that it was given to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I think it's not always the
case with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's a focus about money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's a focus about ego.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can take that out of it and
share the passion for the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I think that is that's super
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super contagious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the beauty of this stuff like
white thorn rose and skittles and some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these things that maybe some of the
diehard guys, they're like, I like gas or
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this stuff that's super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the beauty of that stuff is I feel
like like white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give a rosin pen to anybody in the
world that smokes cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could taste it and they could
appreciate the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very relatable, especially when you
get stuff like roses or candy or some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, I feel like the Ridgeline
runs when I first tasted the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like you get this there's candy,
you know, in the front and then there's
[SPEAKER_03]: complexity with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and then the Lance is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Ridgeline runs, I first tasted
that up and humbled, I think about three
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago before you won the Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you guys had won the Cup right
after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's there's something to
be said about special genetics like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether you like and whether you don't
like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're something that can be
appreciated by everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like the green lantern.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one there is completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's just so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high of it is just a whole different
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does to your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally makes you feel like you're
almost on mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but it goes away quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like everything these
unique strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we shouldn't let them
get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just everybody's so focused on the
same, same strains, the same candy
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so much more out there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, people get fixated on stuff
and it happened with haze in the you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the early 2000s, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard the lemon cherry gelato lemon
cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept hearing it over and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ever even smoked it, you know,
finally started smoke some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just I was expecting something so
great because everybody it's hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is 99 percent hype, it seems
like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's consumed by people that aren't
connoisseurs necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also the Instagram world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to smell it on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're you're looking at the phone and
you're like, man, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, maybe it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we grow some amazing weed,
but it's not always perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I deal with, you know, shitty ass weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you take a picture of it from the
right angle, I'm not going to take about
[SPEAKER_02]: directions of shitty weed, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we're just we're being a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never going to grow all good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially you go to my little farm and
there's 25 different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I sacrifice a lot of my farm to
new strains because I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to lose my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to make money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm seeing what what a new strain is
going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And watching it, what it creates and it's
exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's really depressing
because it turns into shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's those unicorns you get where all
of a sudden you're like, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it Johnny Johnny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he gets excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden we're back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's happening with our
strain together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have we have a few we have
multiple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had smoked one of the Finos the other
day that actually threw out prior because
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't look as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to go dig it up in the compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking this thing and it's like you
break it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like a lavender look.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like a grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I threw it out already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have other seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that's the beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is this is the actual art.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's this is what's sparking my,
you know, the flame again is this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd rather do that than just
grow a field of weed any day of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it gets super exciting with breeding
because you never know really what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to end up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your lines at a certain point,
you really start understanding your lines
[SPEAKER_03]: and what your genetics are going to
contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you start putting them on other
things and you don't really know what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can guess, but it's not always exactly
what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's that element of surprise
where you have to wait three months after
[SPEAKER_03]: you've made the seeds and made the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be six months from the time you
decided or a year from the time that you
[SPEAKER_03]: decided to make the cross before you
actually see a finished product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's something to be said about
patience and waiting and to be able to see
[SPEAKER_03]: something special and magical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But looking for those opportunity,
lots of times it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of times you think it's going to be a
way, a certain way, and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: counterintuitive and it ends up being the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you might find something that's
completely different where you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where this came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing how certain strains are so,
I mean, I crossed into like Gushman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain strains just hold their strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's amazing producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's the bag of peels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't smoke good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like ice cream cake 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the end of the day, sad to say
it's like, okay, it could be a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: points less than Lance, but if you're
going to grow 30% more, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: just go that route and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I said, that's a difference
of just growing to make money,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we all have to make a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, or me wasting a whole greenhouse with
a bunch of different strains that I'm,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm searching for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the extract I think is amazing,
but I feel like Gushman's is another one
[SPEAKER_03]: where too many people got ahold of it and
they just blew it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more linear and more subtle,
but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a redwood tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can knock somebody out with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, and that's, so that's
why I wanted to cross with that with Lance
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, for the weight and how
strong it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some purple ones I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did find some that actually have some
really good flavor, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really, it's really fun to find
strains like that double OG chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many awards has rebel grown
one with that tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so crossing that I have multiple that
look just like it, but then I have one
[SPEAKER_02]: that's purple and has a little more candy
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one I'm going, Oh my gosh,
you know, I mean, even the Cheetah piss
[SPEAKER_02]: now we're talking about that, you know,
smells okay, whatever, but it's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the, it grows amazing in my climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get powder mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I cross it with the Lance and now all
of a sudden I'm finding one with flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, I mean, that's,
that's kind of the cool thing is being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to pick a grouping of strains that
you know, you like a little bit of a piece
[SPEAKER_02]: of and put it, you know, put yours into
there and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's nostalgic for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you, if we talk about different
OG, like a real gassy one, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: like tastes like dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of times, you know,
I still will go and smoke with my dad and
[SPEAKER_02]: he has some of these old school ones that
have that karate really carrot flavoring
[SPEAKER_02]: and that'll bring me back to my childhood
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but yeah, the OG that the Jack
and like a lemon haze, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think before we, we skip over,
I think it's really important for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to recognize how many women grower up
growers there are out there and the
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent job they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, when I was growing up,
you know, the women always helped and
[SPEAKER_00]: supported the men and kind of were
overlooked is really playing a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: part in the success of your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really they played just as much of a
role as we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you, now you got people like
moon made farms, Tina, and you got soul
[SPEAKER_00]: spirit farms, Judy and Walter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hannah and Riley at Emerald Queen
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, there's some amazing women
grower out there that deserve a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they have a bond,
I think with the plant that is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different than ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, super excited to be working with
those people and really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge, you know, their, their role
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mentor was a female, her name is Gypsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like she kind of put me on the
right path.
[SPEAKER_03]: And.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I haven't appreciated my
mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an appreciation for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my mother was a strong female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, she, she, she was the first female
officer at the bank of California back in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1969.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, when women weren't
officers at the bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've always had a lot of respect
for women.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like cannabis is no different,
but women have a special relationship with
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a Gypsy grow alongside a guy and
they had the houses next door.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the same genetics to each other
and her flower, the same genetics from the
[SPEAKER_03]: same clones, hers came out better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fed, they fed the same, they use the
same soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just a different relationship
sometimes that people have with the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like, you know, we can talk
about vibrations and a lot of hippie
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, but sometimes there's just
something special that gets passed on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that happens from person to person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend's out there right now,
actually, while I'm down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend, you know, and you know,
the hippie stuff, she, she does a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sound healing and she walks around with
the gong and does her little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let her have, you know, let her do
her thing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think, uh, when you're,
when you're spending time with the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is, I think it, uh,
it really responds to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plant responds to stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: It responds to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It responds to, and it's one of those
things that what you put into it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It directly correlates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, the more passion,
the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, you know, we knew the people
that always say either they're stereo
[SPEAKER_02]: going in the room for the, and it's like,
I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, for me, it's just the more
energy you put into a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more you take care of the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, I've heard stories and,
and some of my friends, I think of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment around, especially with light
depth, um, really adding a red spectrum to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those earlier light depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a feeling on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you experimented around with that at
all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'm a big fan of far red, uh,
for finishing the plant for sure in
[SPEAKER_03]: flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that far red is going to
bring out color.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for purple, that's where
a lot of the LEDs, you know, have done
[SPEAKER_03]: good at HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get better color with HPS from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, the LEDs with the far red,
like we have the adjustable spectrum LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That far red is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those lights you got are off the chart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can totally program those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're science dragging alpha's
big shout out to science for the lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're fully programmable and you can
do multiple spectrums.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can mimic an HPS and a CMH and you can
add far red and you can mimic the Samsung,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, chip if, if that's what you're going
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and so the beauty of it is like doing
trials and figuring out what's best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big AB tester.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always trialing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, well what's better is
under canopy better than, uh, light lifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it's a new deal right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had Tim on the show, uh,
Bobby bags, uh, recently, and I'm a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: fan because I see the results that my
friends are getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, when I first heard about it,
I was like, eh, he's a little skeptical,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power is a little cheaper than our power
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, the thing is, is like,
when I heard about it five years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew my buddy was telling me about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well that's it's a, it's
uncharted territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I was thinking all this time and
and he confirmed it is that the real
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit where you're going to see the most
benefit is from green housing,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I feel, especially winter runs,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like winter runs are always a struggle,
but you put that under canopy light in and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lights are actually $200 a piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and you use one light on a four by
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably changing pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like technology does right from the right
when they first came out to now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they put a bunch of far red in theirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they were actually did a lot of
trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get to the point where they're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So their lights are fully tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can't say that about everybody
else's, but I feel like their lights are
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen it firsthand, the results
that you get and the benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the other thing I'm testing
right now, we're doing trials with a
[SPEAKER_03]: horizon light lifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're actually a lifts that bring
your lights closer to the plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: further up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can really dial it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does it automatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dial in your, your par.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's, I think it's a
interesting concept and we're going to try
[SPEAKER_03]: with the horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're doing with the faven we're
doing without, and then we're doing with
[SPEAKER_03]: both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I have four rows and we're going to
do on each row, something slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: different though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breeding and trying to figure out
all these things and you're breeding and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out all these different
light things at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of different things to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and what I'm doing is I'm trying to
see what's going to create the most amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of seeds for quality seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, when you're doing seed
production, the bottoms that don't get as
[SPEAKER_03]: much light, you don't get as much light as
you get white seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now what if I can get rid of that
and where I'm, I do a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do thinning on the under canopy with my
indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try the favens and see what
happens if we don't thin and we only,
[SPEAKER_03]: or if we only thin and we don't completely
strip the under canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are your thoughts on,
I didn't hear you mention feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think feminized seeds at scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think feminized seeds are okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can have intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have intersex traits that are
recessive and that don't express until you
[SPEAKER_03]: put them on something else with intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everything's got intersex traits
all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can find stuff that's stable,
that's genetically stable, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have intersex traits and breed with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think through selection and putting
the time in and energy, you can find stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: with feminized just as easily as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think genetic depression is a real
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people don't
understand that crossing gelato with
[SPEAKER_03]: something that has gelato in it,
again, with something that has gelato and
[SPEAKER_03]: over and over and over, you get genetic
depression and then your genetics get
[SPEAKER_03]: weaker, more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They lose their vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need to cross that with something
that's completely different to get that
[SPEAKER_03]: vigor back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making mother plants out of,
from a feminized seed plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of
misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I made a few, I did a few this year
and then somebody said, oh, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, hesitant,
but they looked okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to, you know, not go all in,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think trust, but verify with
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In life and everyone's opinion and trust,
but verify with genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of the rename games.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think they have something because
it was called that, but maybe it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But feminized seeds, I don't personally
think there's anything wrong with
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you're growing an acre of
cannabis or an acre of hemp, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to want feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the most, that's,
that's the cheapest way to do it and to
[SPEAKER_03]: get the best results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now clones and all these other things,
you can do it that way, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds is the most economical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can get very stable seeds,
you can get as good, if not better quality
[SPEAKER_03]: than clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and I think for the longest
time, I was scared of feminized seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: the nineties and early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was much different back
then when we were figuring it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's nothing wrong with making
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with breeding with
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are some reasons you
would want to breed with regular seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: have regular seed stock, but I personally
don't think that that is a reason to not
[SPEAKER_03]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we, we make those two and you know,
we, we share them with people just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes that step a little bit easier for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing I'd like to tell people
about is reciprocal breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, reciprocal breeding would be taking
the Lance, putting it on the white thorn
[SPEAKER_03]: rose, and then also taking the white thorn
rose and putting it on the Lance to see
[SPEAKER_03]: what kind of results you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do reciprocal breeding from both
sides and then potentially you can breed
[SPEAKER_03]: those in together and find some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think really doing it both ways,
seeing what you get, you start
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding your lines and seeing what
gets inherited by each, each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that new cross we did,
do you think it took on, be careful with
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it took on more of the
white thorn rose flavor or expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: than the Lance or vice versa?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the male Lance, we bred it to the
female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely took more white thorn rose
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it got some more of the Lance
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little Lance flavor issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's white thorn rose is
powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's hard to overtake
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do think like it's everyone we've
had so far, definitely I could see that
[SPEAKER_02]: white thorn rose in it, but white thorn
rose has definitely a different structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of that outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shitty structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the alternating, just call it how it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the alternating, no matter how far
you break it down, there's always that
[SPEAKER_00]: little piece of stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of times aroma and you know,
we can call it turps or whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that profile, the flavor profile is
directly correlated to the structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles is a great example.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times the most skittly thing that
has the most Z in it is actually yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has that same Z structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you breed it to something amazing and
you're going to try to find Z crosses that
[SPEAKER_03]: are Z, the ones that are the best are the
ones that have the worst structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can usually pick out the Z ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we do crosses with Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the ones over in the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the runs you look at the little
smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I crossed that with Lance multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a candy Lance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think white thorn needs to be
crossed with Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now call it Riddles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won the ego clash in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certain strains, like you're crossing
skittles, but that skittle flavor is so
[SPEAKER_02]: damn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get diet skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And diet skittles overtook the white thorn
rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely more skittly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why are you trying to cross it if
you're trying to have the skittle flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that situation, what you would do is
you would back cross it to the white thorn
[SPEAKER_03]: rose again, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have the skittles in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cross it with the white thorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're selecting for something in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or trying to see what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're looking for some decent
structure because with both of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're struggling in structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really the most commercially
viable strain to put into like an indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean it can't be used for
rosin and other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even pre-rolls where people don't
look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you give someone a pre-roll of
it or a pre-roll of skittles and they
[SPEAKER_03]: never see it, they smoke it, they're like,
oh my God, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they look at the bud, they're like,
eh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the problem with Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with skittles,
and maybe it was just the skittles that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had that I stole from him, was that when
you dry it, it kind of discolored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more turned, not brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a little, the flavor was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it turned a little off color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had, well, the thing is the skittles,
you have to harvest it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't over, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I overriped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not one of those ones you wait for
the hairs to turn brown because it turns
[SPEAKER_02]: brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would guess the white thorn rose and
skittles are, you know, the Z is very much
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're doing it indoors on day 53
to day 56 is really when you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to day 63.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to day 63 with skittles indoor
with that Z terp, you don't, it's stronger
[SPEAKER_03]: flower, but you definitely lose something
as far as like flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the high, even the highest skittles,
it gets, it's dimmed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get more of like a stony high.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of a bright high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these strains too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you let it get over that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, all of a sudden I'm
waiting for a photo shoot and I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: leave these plants for an extra week or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh my God, this is killing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we harvest it and it's just,
you could tell it just, it smokes a little
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the terps kind of go away,
especially under the sun because the sun's
[SPEAKER_02]: so powerful, especially on that first
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So harvest, all that's so crucial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you guys thinking about releasing
seeds in the near future?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a good move.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I probably mean you are
releasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some, but see, it's like,
I probably could be tired on the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: game, honestly, but I've, I hate giving
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to try them first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to grow them first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like seeds are so important and
valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, you know, if I'm not really
attached to that cross, I'm just going to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, drop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, once I'm really attached to
it, I feel like seeds are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge a lot for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it worth your while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like anything, once it goes out,
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's just how this thing is
right now, but they're all different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the feminized ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm selling some, you know,
and it's, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the green lantern, it's been there
for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for people to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's like, I don't need to
hoard.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hoard a strain forever,
it's not going to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, I want people to enjoy it,
but I got to get, I think more comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: of just, okay, I'm not going to find the
unicorn every time and let other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think planning it out and going for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's just an untapped
market for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like if you go to Emerald cup
with seeds, you'd get to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see these lines that people jungle boys
buying a clone for a thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, well, it's probably not
jungle, but one of those ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're buying like clones for a
thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, holy shit or seeds pack
seeds for three, four bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I have so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cross the white rose into the back into
the paradise punt and we call the paradise
[SPEAKER_00]: pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we released that, uh, you know,
on our Tangled roots store site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a winner in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are showing me in participating
with those people is really fun for me
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the summer, they're showing me
pictures of their plants and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like people to grow their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the Lambos out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the Tangled roots legacy store
and that's, that's a, my Lambo G cross
[SPEAKER_02]: with Lance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's, it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, there's some, but just,
I think selectively letting a little out
[SPEAKER_02]: at a time is a safe way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got enough time each year and you're
entering the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like having seeds along the
lines with maybe crosses from the winners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are all into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a great way to share it
with the world too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, grow your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I want people to experience
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then they know what we go
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of people think it's really
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people think it's
really like Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you grow all perfect weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like anybody could do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like anybody can do a podcast,
you know, and it's, it's like anybody can
[SPEAKER_03]: do a podcast, you know, but you got to put
forth the effort and there has to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: dedication and so many other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 30, 40 years of doing it makes it
a lot easier than if you're just doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: for your first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is all we've done our whole
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people want to, yeah, they want to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the time in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people are capable of doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be successful and you're
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to learn how to grow good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see people that you like, and you want
to be like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always a hard thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching somebody grab your pound
that you worked so hard on and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we'll take this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that this one, they just smash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look at, we don't like it or sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like these throw them in the bag and
take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, you know how much time
and energy I put into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to bust your balls in the price.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, Hey, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: $400.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I mean, these are sad times
for those, you know, we talk about three
[SPEAKER_03]: or $400 a pound and you know what that
does to the economy, especially up in
[SPEAKER_03]: humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that, that really, that's a,
you know, something that bothers me and
[SPEAKER_03]: makes me sad is that, you know,
people are trying to get over on other
[SPEAKER_03]: people with 300 or $400 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, I feel like the
streets aren't seeing the benefit from
[SPEAKER_03]: that as much, but the farmers are the ones
that get hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking advantage of the situation
for 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that jar you have of the white thorn
rose is a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after I broke it down,
really it's the farmer or I get three to
[SPEAKER_00]: $4 for that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell it for $65 in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's that much money in between
me and the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to give it to the consumer
for five bucks or 10 bucks and just get it
[SPEAKER_00]: into more people's hands would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the state can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would make all the
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why would people go right in the
store and buy all our product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like, you know, we aren't making
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these pre-rolls?
[SPEAKER_02]: We lose money on all these pre-rolls at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, you know, it's just taxes,
taxes and taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people put trash into
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, there's not a lot of
good pre-rolls out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke my own pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sit there and just don't feel like
rolling a joint, pop open a pre-roll and
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take the exact same pound that we
put in our jars and we give it to the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that manufactured to put it in our
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same exact weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, smalls are kind of even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smalls are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smalls are great for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you use the under canopy lights
and you lose all your smalls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you don't want to use under
canopy lights, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trip that that's like one of the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the smalls market is so huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the smalls market is bigger than it's
ever been.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember a smalls market back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like trim is too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's just, you know,
that people are being able to make so many
[SPEAKER_02]: other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the days where they didn't
charge for trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone used to give it to people for
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all free.
[SPEAKER_02]: All free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd throw it over a bank and then all of
a sudden realize we could make hash out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the hardest time getting people to
separate it so that I could have the sugar
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wanted to separate it, but they
give you their trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hundred plus dollars a pound there for
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people are interested in finding out
more about you guys, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is always a great way to DM me
at four 30 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always up answering questions and
interacting with people that's at
[SPEAKER_00]: Huckleberry Hill farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do have a pretty cool website
that showcases our farm and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and Rose and I, and the sound
healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at pick humble.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good learning experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of our media stuff we done a
lot of videos and stuff that we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that are pretty cool to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really loving these podcasts with two
guests.

forth.

[SPEAKER_00]: farm and really, you know, going a little
bit deeper into our story and picking your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.

from you today and really admire what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really next level stuff.

guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really key in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the future of the industry.

I believe in collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe in, I've always had a business
partner and I believe in working with
[SPEAKER_03]: people and collaborating in a
collaborative effort and being part of a
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger community.
