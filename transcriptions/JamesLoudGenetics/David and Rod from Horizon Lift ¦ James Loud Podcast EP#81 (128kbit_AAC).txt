[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, our special guests are Horizon
Lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Rod and we've got David.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing great, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, thank you guys for coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've become friends over the last six
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, we were introduced through
Grow World and I thought you guys had an
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys came down toward the facility and
said that you thought you had a good
[SPEAKER_03]: product for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started getting all these ideas on what
we could do with your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys had these ideas and you met
with our our main grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we kind of came up with a concept that
worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like you guys have something
really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we think that, you know,
products shouldn't be pitched.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be proven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we created a product and
we're trying to get it out there and let
[SPEAKER_00]: people find out for themselves how well it
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's tell everybody a little bit about
what you guys do in the lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: My story goes back to 1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well before the lift, I was involved in
the retail sales of products in Portland,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, a little place called Light
Manufacturing Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two of us in the whole town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring forward, you know, I got on Craig
Hargrave's radar and ended up at Sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply and have touched over two thousand
products in this industry today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been it's been a fun run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll interject and say that's how
actually we got introduced to Rod is we
[SPEAKER_01]: used to sell we call XRT, but you guys
probably know it as a rope ratchet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started selling those through Rod.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found us and contacted us that I think
I could sell a lot of these for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did and had a great time with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he contacted us again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was probably close to like eight
years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, hey, this is going from a
garage and a closet to a corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we take it from going from selling
our rope ratchets in a closet or in a
[SPEAKER_01]: small only four to twelve lights to a
thousand light facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we actually make it easier for the
consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, can you take what you guys have
created with the rope ratchet and automate
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's basically what started our
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been trying to perfect it for
eight years now and took about five,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've been selling it for the last
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's and the ratchets have
been around forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that's what we all used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchets are versions of some people use
chains, you know, but like I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: what you guys have is very innovative in
the sense that you've automated something
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've all used that actually can
improve the quality of the product,
[SPEAKER_03]: improve efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the evolution of light hangers was
Jack chain, you know, completely through
[SPEAKER_00]: the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Jack chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody moved their lights, you know,
and then it was the grow yo yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all remember the grow yo yo
with the spring inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after about a time, one side would go
down and you'd walk in your room and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights sitting sideways in your room over
your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grow row grow yo yo was just an
inefficient product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to a sales meeting and the owner
of the company brought this product from
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomart and handed it to me and said,
what do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, don't say another word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me contact the patent holders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So found out who the patent holder was
these gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we cut a deal and became the exclusive
vendor of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time the industry has ever seen this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we called it SunGrip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know what happened after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, SunGrip went crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody started coming in to compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: The knockoffs started showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, unfortunately, it's really
tough to stop the knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when they start coming,
there's just too big of a floodgate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just can't poke all the
holes fast enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that deliver free to your house
and stuff didn't help that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you got a lot of direct sales
happening in today's environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The direct sales have really changed the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as a whole, where we used to go to
grow shops and buy everything from grow
[SPEAKER_03]: shops and we had vendors that sent
products to these grow shops that were
[SPEAKER_03]: real knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had people at grow shops that
were extremely knowledgeable and they
[SPEAKER_03]: would help you select the best products
for your environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everything is online and people want
to go direct with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's actually kind of taken
away some of the beauty of our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, the one thing they
overlook is, you know, customer service
[SPEAKER_00]: versus price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to get a great price,
but if something fails with the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's going to support it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody at the other end of the
phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we've seen problems,
big problems in this industry with the
[SPEAKER_03]: lack of customer service from lighting
companies to other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where there's a phone number and nobody
ever gets back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you do if you have lights that
you've spent, you know, especially with
[SPEAKER_03]: these larger facilities where you spend
all this money on lights and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have customer service or you don't
have this or you don't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, it's changed the game
completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's less personable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny you say lighting,
you know, I mean, without customer
[SPEAKER_00]: service, you know, lighting has got a
whole bunch of holes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's hard to repeat a light
over and over and over and hit a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all lighting has a failure rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hope that's a small one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, knowing that all lights are going to
fail at some point, customer service is
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disservice to just hand somebody a
box and go, good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you guys are like Gore-Tex for
lighting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys improve the efficiency of a
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's a bunch of different
interesting ways you can utilize the lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we're using it here and we vege
in a small amount of canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that saves us light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're lowering them way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as the plants get taller,
we expand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're saving money right out of the
gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're able to dial the PPFD in
and then change it from day to day.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the plants grow, we can raise it up or
we can concentrate the PPFD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great product for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, sorry, Rod, but I will say
that we initially, how Rod proposed kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of this project was how do we get people
off ladders?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make their lives more efficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we save them customer or employee
work hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of the start of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't even really think about
increasing your yield, having more THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't even a part of our equation
when we made this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was almost just like an added
benefit of being able to constantly have
[SPEAKER_01]: the PPFD in the perfect position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then growers who know what they're doing,
I've already been doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the average, let's say newbie grower
doesn't do that properly, perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the word is for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't even have PAR meters
in their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't even do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just going off eyeballing or
even temperature readers, which is also
[SPEAKER_01]: super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel like if we took the PPFD reader
with the surface leaf temperature reading,
[SPEAKER_01]: we found like we found like the sweet spot
to grow, which was an added bonus on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of not having your employees get on
ladders anymore and et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera for safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all run from an iPad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a world of efficiency now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I started hearing people
go, you know, how much can you grow a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, well, we never really
cared about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, really think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy's got to get really efficient if
people are going to start playing that
[SPEAKER_00]: game, you know, because there are some
people that are pretty crafty,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and they they lessen the inputs
and still get a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Horizon Lift doesn't add cost to
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're simply moving the light
up and down, you know, and it's fortified
[SPEAKER_00]: movements a cycle at most, you know,
for two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a product that came
into the environment, made it a better
[SPEAKER_00]: environment without adding cost or
additional labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all know labor is a huge
component of a grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity and labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you talked about, electricity and
labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can save on those two things,
then you're, you know, I think at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the day, people want to grow the
highest quality product possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the cheapest price possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without, sorry, but without taking away
from the quality is the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: part, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now there's this race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so 10 years ago, before all this
commercialization, like this really
[SPEAKER_03]: increased commercialization of the
product, you could get away with selling
[SPEAKER_03]: an average quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now today there's plenty of average
stuff out there, but it doesn't go for a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're, and also, how much did you
produce that pound for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you produce that pound for $600 and you
can only sell it for seven?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you produce it for three and sell it
for seven?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's so much product on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, especially in California,
we have this surplus of product,
[SPEAKER_03]: yet we only consume so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in metric, especially with the
recreational cannabis, it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational medical, there's only so much
product that we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: People want the best product they can get
for the price.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless you're growing the best,
you might as well just quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's my opinion right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so quality has to be the leading
factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts with genetics, but then it's
also inputs and all these other things
[SPEAKER_03]: that happened over a period of the life of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the eighties and
nineties, the indoor environment was the
[SPEAKER_00]: only environment for multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's more study and more
time on the indoor environment than any
[SPEAKER_00]: other environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot being done now, but I still
think today, all the knowledge is really
[SPEAKER_00]: from an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are kind of feeling their
way through hoop houses and greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: and double tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everybody's kind of finding
their way through that right now to where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 35 years of indoor growing out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we probably wouldn't be growing
indoors at the level we're growing at if
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't for prohibition of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we were growing outside
and then people wanted to hide from the
[SPEAKER_03]: police.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, helicopters over your fields and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we went indoors and then they did,
we're not allowed to research it,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Federally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you can't research it because
it's a bad plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's illegal, all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we've lived in this
backwards world and now indoor is fetching
[SPEAKER_03]: the most price.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, it's supposed to be the
best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't honestly think indoor is the best
in every regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a place for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place for greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a place for light lifts in
a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we actually are in a
greenhouse up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's helped out actually them quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but supplemental, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you have the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in addition to, and I think that's a
great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what I ran into, and you
know, when you introduce a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of things come out of the
woodworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses aren't always structured the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have an amount of weight that
you're going to put on that ceiling in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them can't take it because you're
using Unistrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're adding too much
additional weight to that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some grease houses can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in that environment,
you would have to certify the weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make sure the structure is going
to hold the weight and then go because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a huge advantage in greenhouse
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just cautious to go, Hey, everybody
put these up in your greenhouse because
[SPEAKER_00]: there is going to be structural integrity
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the definition of a
greenhouse is so broad, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you, there could be so many
different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some people consider hoop houses,
greenhouses, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, but these Dutch
greenhouses, the Venlo's like these glass
[SPEAKER_03]: houses, they can support, you know,
they, they cost more than indoor gross
[SPEAKER_03]: typically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, especially for the nicer
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Rod's talking about like up in
Oregon, the greenhouses that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: there for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like we've actually sold to a
greenhouse in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned that about structure and
they're like, we're weighted for a
[SPEAKER_01]: hurricane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this thing's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, all these cut flower greenhouses,
they converted into cannabis and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not all suitable for the lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some, a lot of people don't have power
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody, but you know, power has to
be a consideration too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm a fan of supplemental lighting,
light lifts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they all need to be explored.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're exploring them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a trial with the under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing a trial with the light lift
and then together proceed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're the only ones doing that
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the results that we get from
that, it's going to be really telling
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know that we're going to get
more from the light lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we're going to get more from
the under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we combine them, what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a mystery, but we're going
to explore that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I've got seven years
into this product and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every product that I ever put across a
goal line, I personally tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was just a rule that I had
with myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to tell somebody else to use
it, then I got to know in my heart that it
[SPEAKER_00]: works right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that this isn't snake oil and you
know, there's been some products that
[SPEAKER_00]: people just absolutely scratched their
head at, you know, I mean, I'll take you
[SPEAKER_00]: back to frequency water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my sales staff wanted to shoot me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no frequency water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you tell me why I
sprayed that on a bug and the bug is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tested it and it's water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if you can tell me what I'm
missing here, you know, I'll go a
[SPEAKER_00]: different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I think I got the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have no chemicals,
no residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spraying water on bugs and killing
them, you know, with frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know that there was frequency in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever was in there, I tested it and
it was water and it was killing bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along my path, I've run into some
really strange products that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: went, this is super beneficial for this
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's snake oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's been so much snake oil out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also we get these things and it
takes a long time to actually perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like purple LED lights, that's a
reference that we use on this show so
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like something that I did not
believe in when I heard LEDs and I saw
[SPEAKER_03]: purples, the blurples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no way am I ever going to use
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a six inch tall or one foot tall
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks like trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want any part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Auto flowers don't want any part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people are creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are persistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will figure out how to improve
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes for LED lights example,
there's a standard down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody uses LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the beauty of this industry
too, is that we are innovative and we are
[SPEAKER_03]: creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have innovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think right when we think we've got
it all figured out, something else new
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just being a steward of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, you know, I've done this the same
way for over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I make it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my job was to create products to make
the environment better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the ratchets, all the data we
collected on the ratchets showed us that
[SPEAKER_00]: people move their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tell me today, it's like,
why do you need to move your lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know, but I've
collected a shitload of data and people
[SPEAKER_00]: move their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason they're buying ratchets
and not jack chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wouldn't buy the ratchets if they
weren't relocating their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went around to a bunch of rooms
and said, how often do you move these?
[SPEAKER_00]: People move them a lot more than you would
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that, I went, well,
let's make this easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's automate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if a guy could stand in his doorway
with his phone and readjust his whole
[SPEAKER_00]: room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how long is that going to take
with the ratchets versus standing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room with an application?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I went to them and said,
is this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we revved it and revved it and revved
it with weights and motors and on and on
[SPEAKER_00]: and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not a simple process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about five years of R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years of R&D, seven revisions is what
you're looking at today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the comment, why did you go
Bluetooth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody's got Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's line of sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want the thing to move lights
in every room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to move them within a certain
distance so that I'm looking at the room
[SPEAKER_00]: that's moving and not the one down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made more sense for the environment
that we were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of confusion in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add to that is that the few
questions we've gotten about Wi-Fi versus
[SPEAKER_01]: Bluetooth was some want to have just a
completely automated place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to sit in a computer
room at their house and be able to see a
[SPEAKER_01]: video of their facility and be able to
touch a button.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want a sensor that changes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've actually looked into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difference is, one, is sensors
aren't perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, your height of your canopy is never
perfectly even.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to grab the top one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we felt that it was just in the best
interest of the grower to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing the high quality
marijuana that you're hoping for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to be there and be
hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do it from a separate control
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I think there is some future
that does include stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's 100% automated and you have a
sensor and every day as the plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing taller, it could move it up if
you're trying to keep the perfect PPFD or
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf surface temperature or however you
want to monitor that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe someday that's going to be
the next evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have that capability and we could
actually do it, but we haven't seen that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's worth it at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that it will eventually go
in that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I see the future is there's going
to be places where they don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of employees because the thing is,
is what we need to do is save money as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as possible, create the best product
possible at the lowest price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're going to take away labor
because labor is expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could take away electricity or turn
down the lights, make the lights more
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient, that's another way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way, the cost of the product is
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody is very aware of every penny
that they're spending these days,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that are still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've toured a lot of facilities in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe is very, very cautious on price
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, they have some of the most
efficient grows I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as I toured a lot of roads
facilities over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talk about greenhouses,
you know, they got roller structures in
[SPEAKER_00]: them to where when they change the lights,
they put a dolly up on top and they roll
[SPEAKER_00]: across the top of the greenhouse,
changing bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, they build structure into
their greenhouses to make them more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the most amazing grows I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my life over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of those Dutch greenhouses
are just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the technology that goes into
it, it's like you have the full control of
[SPEAKER_03]: an indoor with the light of the sun and
supplemental lighting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their technology is amazing,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, them having the largest flowers
in the world obviously comes from their
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom stimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over there and kicked tires on
bloom stimulants and some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: technology is just out of this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they have so many years of R&D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they've been R&Ding this stuff
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus they have a really good environment
for R&D in the cold, in the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremes, you know, like if you look at
extremes, it's a great place to test stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: out in extremes.
[SPEAKER_03]: How well does it do when it gets below
zero?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, house and garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, very successful European
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I sat down with that team,
you know, and they were completely happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the distribution they had and shake
my hand and said, you won't be selling
[SPEAKER_00]: ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a bold move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought I had the world in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, we're a national
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can put you all over the
United States in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he shook my hand and said,
no, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I said, well, back to home I
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not taking the bag of tricks home this
time, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some really neat stuff over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Europe is an amazing place to
learn, you know, about growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that America is, you know,
that far behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's just like it's different here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of great things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to learn about genetics,
there's good things you can learn in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe, especially Dutch, Dutch over in
Spain and over in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also here, I mean, we have amazing
scientists here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we have people pushing the
envelope in every region of the world
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, you know,
the one example I would use is Gavita.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey Twan and Jair.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, bros?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, went over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were some of the first people I met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, developed a really good
relationship with them and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to bring that back to sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did really well with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they made a great light too,
especially the double ended Gavita when it
[SPEAKER_03]: first came out was a game changer.
Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first one I remember that was
double ended was the EPAP, the Papillon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that came out and that was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a greenhouse light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Gavita is like, just put all
these indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: People tried putting the EPAPs indoors,
but really the Gavita kind of changed the
[SPEAKER_03]: game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, as far as like the quality that it
put out, you know, I was pretty impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first harvest with the Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some big players involved
with EPAP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought EPAP was going to be
the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, Twan and Jair outworked
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they came to the United States
and just flat out worked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole period was really impressive
because that was kind of the beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: the commercialization of cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it really took on a whole new,
it was like this whole new momentum that
[SPEAKER_03]: we were experiencing that we'd never seen
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, what's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything was bigger than the
previous move.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were getting these big grows in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just the scale that people were
starting to go out was like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is really becoming big business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's one thing where we had these
hydro shops and there's these big
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers and they're selling and it's
all going through hydro shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next thing is, is like, we're talking
about farms that they're running acres and
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses that are acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even the first time I
walked into a 20,000 square foot canopy,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now 20,000 square feet of canopy in a
greenhouse is nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's not very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you do when you harvest that
amount of weed and you have no way to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, that's, that's a huge
amount of product that is decomposing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the thing is, is like,
a lot of people were like, we're just
[SPEAKER_03]: going to grow and figure it out along the
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there's so many components
you need to really dial in as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: storage, drying and curing properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you store it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you preserve it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you make it last as long as
possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're able to sell it,
you still want to have those things in
[SPEAKER_03]: mind.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I mean, dispensaries in the
Pacific Northwest, you know, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing process and the time it takes to
actually get it into the jar and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got products that are two
months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if this wasn't preserved
properly, you know, you got brown frown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was the beauty of the medical
days, Pacific Northwest, Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan of Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in Washington and Oregon and
California, I spent a lot of time in those
[SPEAKER_03]: three states in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with medical, the product was really
fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was sold compared to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, you bring your stuff down,
you're a vendor, you bring it down,
[SPEAKER_03]: you show it to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to get it sold and you know,
your money back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if they paid cash, they want to get
their money back for the cash that they
[SPEAKER_03]: paid right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was a whole different model.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't the testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think testing is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think testing is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's tested more than any other
ag product out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that that's a beautiful part.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, is like the farm to
table experience, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how fast are you getting it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two months old, if it's preserved
correctly, can still be a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's not preserved correctly,
like the seeds in the mail or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: happens, sometimes these things,
like if the seeds get hot and they go in
[SPEAKER_03]: the mail, you could have bad seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the flower gets hot, what's sitting on
someone's shelf or waiting to get
[SPEAKER_03]: packaged, that flower is a bad product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it could be an inferior product to what
it would have been before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's sitting in a one gallon glass jar
and the sun's hitting it from the window,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more to this that still
needs to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, it's not going to grow
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And preserving the product, I think is one
of the big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most important ones in the
shortest period of time that you can screw
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have this whole life of the
plant where you can screw it up and it
[SPEAKER_03]: can, it can take away from that big pie.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that preservation period where you're
drawing it, you're curing it, you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming it, and you're storing it for
sale or selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the, in my mind, that's one of the
most important periods.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's as important as starting
with good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear it from a lot of the growers,
you know, they're going, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I wish my product could get to the
shelf faster, you know, because my
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation's on it, you know, and because
it's not properly handled, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick up some bad reputation because the
product's not what I gave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to see direct sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I would really love to see
direct sales is from the farm to the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer where you can go up, you can talk
to the grower or the hash maker or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, and you can talk to him about
the love that he put in that plant and how
[SPEAKER_03]: much he cared about those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can go buy a fresh ounce or a
fresh eight.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the, you know, we've done that with
breweries and wineries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the standard there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard of a model in New Mexico where
they were growing in the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were drying in the middle of the
building and the dispensary was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had two glass windows where people
could look through and see the product
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a list of the fresh product of
their product that was available next
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, amazing platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't been to New Mexico to
see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some pictures of it,
but I went, what a great platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is as quick as you can get it
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: California just came out with the new law,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're allowed to actually have a
facility that you can smoke and have food
[SPEAKER_01]: and drink now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that just passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got signed in, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited for the future of that,
for smoking lounges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might change kind of like what
you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it does because I feel like
cannabis is a lot healthier than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing it with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not do it with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like it's the perfect model,
especially because there's so many
[SPEAKER_03]: passionate people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's passionate people with alcohol,
with wine and beer too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, but people that love
cannabis really, really love cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: they love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, invested.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then that just makes it more
of an experience too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the second you can get, it's just
like, meeting you guys and using your
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to, I get this different experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing buying stuff, but then when
you meet the people behind it,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you start to understand really what
the product's about, what went into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Customer service is so huge too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of people pour over the
fence, you know, from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different industries that didn't cut their
teeth there, you know, and you can sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had conversations, you know,
like cat hasn't been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's really nothing you
can do about that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the guys that have been here a
long time and they're knowledgeable and
[SPEAKER_00]: the old school guys like me, you know,
we've always talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, we didn't hide our
secrets and you know, Hey, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell you how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we wanted everybody to have good
weed because if we ran out, we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: someplace to go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it wasn't about,
you know, Hey, I'm going to be better than
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I'm not going to tell you
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten really competitive now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be so much more community
driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that part of the industry,
this community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like my show is all about community
and bring into light different people in
[SPEAKER_03]: the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing great things like you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the early Burning Man,
you know, the early reggae is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: river.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, today's environment is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not that relaxed, you know,
brotherhood it used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but everything good has an end and it
changes things more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Disco.
[SPEAKER_03]: We miss disco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss disco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but I miss
disco.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Studio 54 and disco, they had his
day where I bet it was so amazing and I
[SPEAKER_03]: wish I would have been able to experience
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, things change and you know,
we grow and evolve and the one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: constant has changed for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I go back to the beginning
when this guy goes, come check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had taken two buckets and filled
one with pea gravel and was pouring water
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomatoes were huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this thing was blowing up in his
backyard, you know, and he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could sell this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cut my teeth into hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up making an assembly line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were assembling in his basement and out
to the UPS truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next thing you know, we had a retail
store and the police would park across the
[SPEAKER_00]: street and they'd put cameras on the
telephone poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the 80s was was a tough
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Nancy Reagan was out there
swinging that bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yeah, I picked it up when Richard
Nixon dropped it and I'm going to club way
[SPEAKER_00]: more people than he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wreaked havoc.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of some people
unknowingly were doing the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now if they were to look back,
they'd say, well, cannabis wasn't so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done this with everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, it's a strange thing
that we went through all this and people
[SPEAKER_03]: suffered so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just, it's really
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about a time when, you know,
people got five years for a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: People got prison sentences for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's seeds are considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can ship them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give them to your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ship them in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you started working in hydroponics in
the 80s and the 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 81, a friend of mine created the
system and had me come over to his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got kicked out of this house
because we had too many UPS trucks coming
[SPEAKER_00]: for deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically enough, everybody stared at
each other and go, you know, how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: sell this thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically enough, we took out a
little tiny ad in Popular Science
[SPEAKER_00]: magazine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular Science was huge back in the early
80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ad comes out first of the month and phone
starts ringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we set the phone down,
there wasn't call waiting back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we set the phone down,
it would start ringing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sat there and took orders for
almost eight hours straight off of this
[SPEAKER_00]: phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went, my God, people like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went, how long is this going to
last?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we stayed there making them out of this
house until we got the letter from the
[SPEAKER_00]: city saying, you guys got to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't run a business in a
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends started light manufacturing
company and we started buying rockwool for
[SPEAKER_00]: the system and upgraded the tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We upgraded a lot of the fittings for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we revolutionized it and out
it went and sold a million dollars the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, you know,
people started paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, man, there's a grow shop over there,
you know, and it was us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know American Ag was the other shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two of us in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically enough, if they didn't get
what they wanted for our store,
[SPEAKER_00]: they said, well, I'm not shopping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to shop at American Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then guy would come in the store and
go, I'm never shopping at American Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shopping at your store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we swapped customers for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back and forth because you got one choice
or the other, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and system did really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started getting into product
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we got that nutrient
handbook out by Rusk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back in the eighties, way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all read that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all put in our two cents and we
built the fertilizer called golden grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found and no one's done it to
this day is, you know, the micronutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are tough to blend into a 200 pound batch
of powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got very small amounts,
you know, other than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got decent iron, but we went,
you know, how was this working?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we know that every scoop
is going to give that same micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: kick?
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created an A and B and we'd created
a micronutrient liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we liquefied it, we have now
divided it equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had, you know, golden grow,
golden bloom and micro gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sold it for 20 years and absolutely
made a fortune from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All from that book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for you, because I'm
really curious as to what you just said
[SPEAKER_03]: made me wonder, did nutrients start out as
a dry mix that then went into liquid and
[SPEAKER_03]: now we're going back into dry again,
or was it always liquid?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was a... Because I know there was
three part for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: General hydroponics was around in 1976.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their distribution range wasn't huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you kind of really had to pull
some teeth to yank it all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another liquid that we had that
came out of the commercial industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Ag had commercial flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was Eco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lady out of Seattle that had
Eco grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she had her own powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went, you know, hey,
look, you know, there's room for us in
[SPEAKER_00]: this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that book, Trial and Error,
Trial and Error, whoops, killed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, too much of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we finally got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had the hydroponic
system, we had the hydroponic media,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had the fertilizer for it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And off to the races we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a very, very successful
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we had to worry about was,
you know, people pulling in with covered
[SPEAKER_00]: license plates and cops burning down the
street after them when they left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was a tumultuous time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone had to talk about tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't use the word weed,
cannabis, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's how it was even in the
nineties, when we used to go to go shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was tomatoes or you would get kicked
out of the shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would lose their shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would put undercovers in there
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would have a really good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they said, well, yeah, I'm growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, dude, you got to leave the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, no, I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that was the I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, he's a cop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just crazy how they would just
try to infiltrate us week after week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Portland, they really cracked
down on it and they made huge arrests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was pretty gnarly for a period of
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green merchant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green merchant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wolf Stigall was part of that too,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got stuck up in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex from Throwers Edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a lot of us.
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say I got away scot-free,
but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a story for another time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So David, tell me how you got your start
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you smoking in high school?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably started smoking in high
school and just have been a you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the term for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a casual smoker for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But literally, I met Rod like 10 years ago
and just absolutely loved like this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came from the hardware background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different category, definitely a
different vibe and a different culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we actually hooked up with Rod and
Sunlight Supply at the time, it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, how do I get into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I like the people like meeting
people like you, meeting people like Rod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like every person I've met, I've really
enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And curious people, intelligent people,
always trying to find the next best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I was coming from a different
category where it was a race to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we take as much out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't really care about the quality
like you spoke about earlier about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take the money out,
but you also need to leave the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking out quality to try to
basically get it as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets tight and it gets hard and
it's not fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I actually came over to here and
kind of been poking around and looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into things, it was like, oh, this is this
is where I should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been good ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm on a big, steep learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I've been in it for eight
years, but I am not a professional grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am learning daily as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which I also enjoy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I ask you stupid questions all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I come see your facility,
I ask probably the most basic,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those kind of questions are never
stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, those are, those are the
kind of questions that you should be
[SPEAKER_03]: asking, because if you don't know the
answer, you might as well ask me or ask
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody who knows the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause and then sometimes we stumble on
some crazy ideas, you know, with the light
[SPEAKER_03]: and with, with the system that you guys
have, I love it because we can,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've customized it to our own specs,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took the unit stretch and we painted
it white and we wanted to match the
[SPEAKER_03]: building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, the unit startup top
that used to, just be a stainless.
[SPEAKER_03]: We we've covered that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not stainless, but yeah, but you
know, the steel we've, we basically
[SPEAKER_03]: painted a white and then it blends in the
room and it really fits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, and depending on the type of
light you can really customize the system,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, you know, my partner is all
about aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about functionality and quality
and he's like, how can we make this look
[SPEAKER_03]: better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you already have all that stuff
covered, so let's make it look nice too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you marry the two, then you have
the perfect equation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you obviously need to have your
quality in your, in, in that, but
[SPEAKER_01]: aesthetics is also a very big component of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say your facility is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those rooms you have in there,
world class.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it's a showroom too,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, it's a showroom and
it's also, it's a showroom for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, but companies like yourself,
it's a showroom for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can share with the world our ethos,
how we believe the plants should be grown,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how, how the different genetics
work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and specifically genetics,
it's like we're, we're focused on
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, how can we grow the plant to
the best ability so we can show our
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, the true potential of our
genetics, maximize your potential
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the day, it's a,
it's a great showcase for everybody that's
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, you know, I'm, I'm a very big fan of
all the products that I use and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly R and D stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to test everything, get as much
feedback as I can and make my decision on
[SPEAKER_03]: what I want to use for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the best way to R and D is
really get everything in the pot,
[SPEAKER_03]: try all these different things out and
then come up with the, the solution that
[SPEAKER_03]: works the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the way you also do it is
another thing is like, you have it down to
[SPEAKER_01]: such an exact science, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, we talked about, you're only
changing one variable for each test,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not changing nutrients or whatever
it is, you're changing one variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's going to give us the
best honest assessment of how well this
[SPEAKER_01]: would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, like you spoke about earlier,
I'm really interested in combining our
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizon Lift with an under canopy light,
because we have done testing in facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past and not to be a snake,
snake oil salesman, but we've seen a large
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in the yield by moving your
lights, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've also seen that with the
under canopy lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's coming out that they've starting
to see the increase of the yield and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants on the bottom are kind of
getting a little thicker and just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthening on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was photosynthesis occurs at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet trial and error, it's working,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to see the
difference of under canopy lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: our Horizon Lift, and then the combining
of those two to see, is it too saturated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to be like, oh,
wow, this is like the best or just the
[SPEAKER_01]: answer, just getting, sorry, getting the
answer for that's going to be big for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always excited about the answer,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, you're kind of like an
explorer going through, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Christopher Columbus, probably not the
best example, but these days, these days,
[SPEAKER_03]: but being able to explore different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that keeps me excited to come to
work every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, what are we going to find
out today?
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have a whole bunch of fires to
put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else are we going to learn about the
plant or about the way we're growing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, these different spectrums with
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm always interested in is
all these different spectrum spectrums.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we can do spectrum tuning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think is great, but that can
totally be abused.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can totally screw your crop up
when you start experimenting on your own,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people are like, Oh,
I'll just do this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much easier to test with a
fixed position product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're creating your own
variables, you're kind of skewing your own
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a firm believer in, you know,
here's what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's make it do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least use that as a starting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, let's start here and
then maybe tweak this or add a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: far red and see what that does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, I think some of these guys,
they just want to go all over the board
[SPEAKER_03]: and they don't understand how to
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like to really get a good trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to grow it out and see what it
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're comparing it, you need to
compare it in the same exact way that you
[SPEAKER_03]: compared the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not a lighting
technician, but you know, what I see with
[SPEAKER_00]: the under canopies is they're getting
really red.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're taking a full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're basically jamming red up into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting a whole bunch of far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does far red make it bloom better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it also makes it more purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing more purple with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the sides are actually more purple
than the tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a demand for purple
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that it's always going to be
there, but right now the demand is to have
[SPEAKER_03]: purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be all purple,
but people want purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want that look in the bag and,
you know, or in the jar or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with these under canopies,
they have that far red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're seeing an increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we're talking about saving labor
because you're not having to strip your
[SPEAKER_03]: under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting flower there and you're
getting more of a yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you're saving labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting a bigger yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now what happens if we put light lifts
in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, you know, it's still,
the question is to be answered,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that's exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay, well, everybody else is
getting the same results.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can all agree that under canopies are
doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can agree that you're getting better
results with the light lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as far as everybody's getting
better results, they're getting bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting frostier weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting, you know, I think there's
benefits that we can prove.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, but nobody's combined them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody's combined them for seed
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to get more seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause now every, every penny counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The value of seeds has gone down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we can push that, we're increasing
profits, but we could possibly be
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of times on the under canopy,
you know, you get better penetration if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using light lifts too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the question is we get better
penetration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus we have under canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get a hundred percent
yield in seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of times I used to get a lot
of white seeds below, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the light didn't penetrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to do really well now
having, having mine on both sides of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to compress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to, you're going to
have control of the throttle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and now, okay, the other question
is, so we're going to do one run one way,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we're going to have to continue to do
this because I really want to see,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, so if I veg it a little bit longer
and I have a taller plant, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: now we have a wider canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I yield more that way?
Maybe.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: More on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we got more on the bottom and then
we have the power from the top and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: really dial in the PPFD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the answer is,
but I know that it's worth exploring.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can get more seeds, if I can
yield more, and we can translate that into
[SPEAKER_03]: flower production too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, who knows?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do panels out produce bars?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we don't know any of this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're, we're getting a bunch of
data from, from people who manufacture
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, the proof's in the
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, okay, prove it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody talks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about the proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I hear so much noise from people,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much noise in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to MJ biz and everybody's got the
best light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got the best this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got the best that,
but it's like, I need to go around with my
[SPEAKER_03]: friends and go, what do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what gets you the results from the
people that grow the best flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: The end of the day, it's like the people
that are growing the best, what are they
[SPEAKER_03]: using and how are they getting those
results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that years ago, a gentleman
named Neil Anderson came to me with a
[SPEAKER_00]: product called Micorizy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never heard of before, you know,
I've heard whispers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a guy who was playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually brought it to me and said,
let's try this, you know, and what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he explained it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's snake oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Micorizy is real, you know,
and after multiple tests, I went,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, this stuff protects the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant grows better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once it colonizes, you know,
and getting that colonization,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is a little bit of a challenge
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you understand how to colonize
that on the root, on the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so welcome our RTI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's, it's something that's in
nature too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we're creating something in
a lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that occurs in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's like, there's so many
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, it's just, it's
scratching the surface of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: different products, but there's so much
snake oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard for the consumer to go to shop
and sift through all that information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause everybody's got the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got the new, latest and
greatest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that, you know, but as we mature as
an industry, all these things get picked
[SPEAKER_03]: apart and people slowly start learning
what the better products are.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel like that in, in you're in the
industry is it does eventually get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: best product quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that is where everybody's aiming
for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the, like I referred to as the other
category is no one's aiming for perfection
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other category.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like in cannabis, everybody
starts out to grow the best, highest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality cannabis out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ego will lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ego will tell you that yours is the best,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody thinks they've grown it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's this attachment that
we have with this plant where we've grown
[SPEAKER_03]: it and we put our hearts and souls into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to look beyond that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a lot of respect for the
growers that are like, this is good,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm going to do better my next round
or shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't as good as the last room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause some people were just so fixated on
being honest with yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're human.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just, there's human nature
involved with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even like the flower market,
like you look at the flower market and
[SPEAKER_03]: what's available now, it's like,
it's slowly in metric in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon, Washington, Colorado, all these
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think maybe that'll change,
but what I've seen in California is it was
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slowly gotten better over the period
of four, almost five years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, it's like in the
beginning it was all hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still a lot of hype being
sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are like, Oh, there's branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all this and I'm going to sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But slowly, but surely the branding has to
support a quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen that with, with all kinds of
stuff over the years, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure with nutrients too, like all the
hype with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these companies where it's like,
Whoa, those look like cool freaking
[SPEAKER_03]: labels, but you got to have a quality
product to back it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the bag.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found, you know, and I'm not going to
mention any names and stuff, but
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrities don't necessarily sell
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we found that out with
Hardway.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shouldn't be selling nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: The growers should be the celebrities.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, we should make those
growers the celebrities, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that are growing the best
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the simple product development brain,
you go, well, this guy's a celebrity
[SPEAKER_00]: that's known for smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snoop Dogg nutrients, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's going to want these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheech and Chong, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't quite work out that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would buy Be Real's nutrients and try
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be Real, I think he's in a different level
because I feel like he's more connected
[SPEAKER_03]: with the plant on the growing side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Green them, but there's very few
celebrities I feel like would be good
[SPEAKER_03]: representation for a nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so many things you can do
with a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's NPK, you know, and you
know, how many ways can you twist NPK
[SPEAKER_00]: around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the additives start coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the additives good or bad for what
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because the guy who asked,
you know, what's the best way to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just start laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like there's a million ways
to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's smokier stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's high quality, you're doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's low quality, you're doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one way to go, hey,
this is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it this way and you'll be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people grow these plants a
hundred different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was one way, we would all do it
that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's not one way and it's a very
it's a live product, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're growing something that's alive,
that takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, relatively to grow and to perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from one batch to the next,
it's agriculture, you know, from one batch
[SPEAKER_03]: to the next, it's going to be slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the best indoor environments,
you can still get different variables
[SPEAKER_03]: where you get a slightly different end
product.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff's getting more standardized,
but then you get the guy that goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Hey, I jammed a bunch of stuff
into a cow's horn buried in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, it's just good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your weed's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're fixated on the look of the
product too, which is, I think is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's always going to have to
look good, but I think we're going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: more back to the effect and the taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram has really screwed that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what you see is those
beautiful pictures, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's ridiculous, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, maybe you do,
but I think most people, if you showed
[SPEAKER_03]: them what they, what you thought they want
and they tried it, they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, you know, some good old school weed,
like the, the flower that we had in the
[SPEAKER_03]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got to experience 80s weed cause I
started smoking in 91.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like literally the stuff in the
nineties was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor of it, the effect, the way it
made you feel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when Oji Kush knocked on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Oji Kush came hard in the
nineties and it's like pushed everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it stayed as a staple for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had some, you know,
side stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming in, there was a strain in the
Pacific Northwest called Wacom weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and people would go,
the hell is Wacom weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What came from Wacom County?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people didn't make names back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, what do we call this
shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we grow in Wacom County,
go at Wacom weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how simplified the industry
was, you know, and I don't think,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, throughout the whole eighties,
there was more than five or six strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, you get some one-offs once
in a while, but his far as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: regional stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some weed and it's like,
yeah, I can get G13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Oh, can you get some weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Acapulco gold or like, I mean,
maybe that was a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was gone by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they had some regional stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we used to get Mexican weed,
but that could have been from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been from Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: For all we know, we got Mexican weed and
it had seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was even some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that, the higher end Mexican stuff
was actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still had seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you used to get Oaxacan Spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you would get the blonde
Lebanese hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would come in big patties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you real high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got you really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the stuff we used to smoke with hot
knives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heat the hot knives up on the stove.
[SPEAKER_03]: I burned all of my parents knives like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to make a sandwich with every damn
butter knife spurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where the hell are all the butter?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just hid them from my parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want them to see any burned
knives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I was too stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My parents would have lost their shit over
burns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kept them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it was like, why do we only have
four knives?
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot knife with scissors or forks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably could have used spoons.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never tried that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably could have got away with
spoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't want to represent something was
uglier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never ran out of knives though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more at the store if you need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're passed with weed in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you start smoking the seventies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Late seventies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about 74.
[SPEAKER_03]: 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1974.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to my first concert, David Bowie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, these people are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke weed and go to concerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sold, you know, and from that point
on it was Ted Dugent, Leonard Skinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good sales pitch though,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a concert, you see all these
people having fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how can you not relate to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, I think that's just
an easy sell for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it changes your perspective of
going to dead shows, going to whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing good music.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think music and cannabis just go
hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, you know, people would
stand up, you know, they didn't sell you
[SPEAKER_00]: seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody would get down crowded and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could pass around fifths and
joints and everything because they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the concerts were totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I saw Led Zeppelin from 10 feet
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kingdom, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely epic, you know, and life
memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cannabis really tunes you in,
which is what I like about the music with
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis smoking, getting high on that
level is you really get tuned into the
[SPEAKER_03]: music, whereas alcohol, other drugs,
alcohol tunes you out, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, but you take some psychedelics,
you take some, you smoke some weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: eat some edibles, whatever, and get that
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in, like you're
hypersensitive to all the music.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's such a great feeling and a great
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really they're all experiences and not
one of the experiences are quite the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could go to thousands of
concerts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have similar experiences,
but not one of them is going to be exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like something that happens in time
and it'll never repeat itself exactly the
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's one thing that stayed the
same the old time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every girl you walked into in California
was either Bob Marley or Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of them was playing,
you know, and, you know, I got to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big fan of One Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dude, that's our vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Grateful Dead pushed our vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Grateful Dead had a huge impact on the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Marley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob had his place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the impact that he's left is just
huge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and his message, you know,
his message has never got old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the music today,
you know, you listen to it once and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, that's enough of that song.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I never get tired of
listening to either one of those bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that stuff's timeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Led Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That music is timeless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still, you know, in the Led Zeppelin,
Led Zeppelin was before my time for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still love that music.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel I'm very attached to that
music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still listen to Led Zeppelin regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, Jimi Hendrix, Grateful Dead,
a lot of Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Grateful Dead going all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hard drive that has every
Grateful Dead song on it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally all the music recorded.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole terabyte of Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go to a lot of concerts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did go to some and then Dead and
Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been going to Dead and Company for
the last five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: My good friend Ben has been getting me
really good seats for Dead and Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, my wife never got to
experience Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't get to go to any parking lots.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the lot, there was always adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Craziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to go to, I was in Portland
Meadows in the nineties and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing seeing the dead out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got some crazy stories I'll tell you
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you Hart played out there and
was amazing also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hart did an outstanding thing and they had
Dog and the Butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big butterfly that flapped in the
wind behind him the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did communal showers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was, it was an amazing thing
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did another community based thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was very community driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was kind of on the same
vibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about their concerts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're almost their own separate
like town, like their community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like its own ecosystem within
their, that parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very accepting of everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was inclusive and not
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the communities now try
to be exclusive and Grateful Dead was very
[SPEAKER_03]: inclusive of everybody and very accepting
of everybody for who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're allowed to do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You like, you like good music.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're okay with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are people that had passion
for the plant, not for the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that's where all this stemmed from.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here because of that passion,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at the end of the day, that's where
it all stemmed from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at some point we all had to make
a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, it's like my passion for
the sacred plant still exists heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still am just super grateful for all the
things that have happened to me up to this
[SPEAKER_03]: point in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good, the bad and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be here talking to you guys
without a mix of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's been my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I went, wow, I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not all bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way I went.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never understood why cannabis was
illegal because it made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me feel, and once I started
smoking, it was like, I felt like I was
[SPEAKER_03]: home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I found my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that they've arrested people,
the fact that they've ruined lives,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's crazy that it was so accepted to do
that for as long as it was, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've moved beyond that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our memories, unfortunately
people's memories are short term.
[SPEAKER_03]: They start forgetting all the crazy stuff
and people, especially the younger guys
[SPEAKER_03]: that are, they never experienced the stuff
that we had to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in grow shops, we had to talk about
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it sounds crazy when you think
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you were to tell people 15,
50 years from now, it's going to sound
[SPEAKER_03]: even more crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all the bad things happening in
the world, why did you put mandatory
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum sentencing on marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, isn't there worse things,
you know, and it's what, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the gateway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, let me tell you what the
gateway to heroin is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a pill from the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we're talking about gateways,
you know, it's like, man, that first sip
[SPEAKER_00]: of freaking beer was the gateway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and the most, most of the people
that murder people, they're not smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're murdering cheeseburgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not murdering people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the weed mills people out,
it also makes you reflect upon yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis isn't for everybody because I
definitely think it makes you look at
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself in a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people can't handle that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's hard to look at yourself and
it does kind of put things into
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I love about it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really, at the end of the day,
it's like puts life into perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it puts the good, the bad and
the ugly into perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at that last can of green
beans in the cupboard and go, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember college, college days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I used to be a chef just
speaking of college, but like before I was
[SPEAKER_03]: a chef in college, we used to do the wild
top ramen mixes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did all kinds of well-done stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheese whiz and top ramen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got gourmet dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I lived in an apartment,
one bedroom apartment with three guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would mix tuna cans with whatever to
get the protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to get that protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the, you know, the tuna,
but it's like, you got to get creative
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you go to college?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it up here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Diablo Valley college in 94 and
95.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to culinary school in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I, you know, it's like,
the Bay area has been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and we have this huge Grateful Dead
influence in the Bay area too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've always had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people like us sure appreciate you
being a steward of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, somebody's got to take it and,
you know, open their arms and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make it not such a bad place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just one guy trying to share
everybody's stories, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I feel like I'm just this catalyst
that's able to get guys like you guys on
[SPEAKER_03]: the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys can tell your story.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my show is so much bigger than
me, and I just try to really highlight the
[SPEAKER_03]: guests and get their important stories
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really at the end of the day, it's like,
we're part of this bigger, bigger thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that's so much bigger than any one of us
individually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be part of that is really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the more we can all recognize
that, you know, I think it warms my heart,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also it's just, I think it's our duty
to do justice to this plant and do justice
[SPEAKER_03]: to the other people in our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you went to culinary
school and now you're creating flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of things in my life have kind of
tied in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I worked for Charles Schwab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a computer, not an engineer,
but I was a testing engineer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did software testing distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot about business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at Bank of America, Charles
Schwab back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've done a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I roofed houses in Portland when I was
younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Portland and Washington over in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done so many different things to get
me to this point, but they all kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: circle back into what I do now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even the cooking kind of goes into with
the genetics and the flavoring and adding
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors to different genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I like, it's this mass amount of
knowledge that I've had that I try to push
[SPEAKER_03]: into my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really enjoy what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, I really love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love being a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, being able to work with great
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a great team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I enjoy coming to work every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I don't, maybe I won't come into
work, but I really love what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I enjoy the stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of those people who believe it or
not, I love stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I hate stress, I love,
I feel like stress is what made me and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: able to handle stress on a higher level
than most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I function, I'm a high functionality,
a high functioning person with stress,
[SPEAKER_03]: where some people, they, they crumble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the more stress you can
put, I'm just, I'm not giving up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep pushing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that, you know, there's definitely
different levels of stress that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had the, you know,
fortune of working for a gentleman for 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years at Sunlight Supply that I'd never
seen anybody in my life take so much
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and just chew it up, swallow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, there were days where I looked
at him and I was like, man, my head would
[SPEAKER_00]: just blow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, all the things that are
coming at you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a genius at what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what made that place
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He built a team that was second to none.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when he came and offered you a job,
he went, well, I'm either against them or
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a hell of an uphill
battle if I'm against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you threw yourself onto the team and it
was a great opportunity, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: being surrounded with that much talent was
absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call him Steinbrenner because
he hired talent for the position and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we could walk in and just
devastate environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's how cannabis has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you could do it at your house by
yourself, have a good product,
[SPEAKER_03]: make a living at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it requires a team and I love the
team, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love the team mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the thing where it's much bigger
than yourself, whatever, but like there's
[SPEAKER_03]: something special about forming a good
team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you becoming another piece of the
machine, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when, when I'm a component of the
machine and I have these guys and we all
[SPEAKER_03]: fit into place, we all win together,
we all lose together.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just something special about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a very nice team too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, our team is really good,
but that also translates to when we work
[SPEAKER_03]: with you guys or we work with this other
company or we have these collaborations,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and then we all win together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like such an amazing thing when we're
all winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we lose, we all lose together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk to each other about it,
but when we win, we win together and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a great feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot easier to win together than
it is apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can, so there's no one person that
can do it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finding people with their strengths and
weaknesses and finding the things that are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to make you more efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, those are so important,
but yeah, working with people that you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want 10 head growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need one head grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need guys that can pull families.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need guys that can water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need guys that can do this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, then you need media guys and you
need the one guy that handles a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they enjoy it, it's that much
better because it's like, and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are like, you can't enjoy
stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not that I enjoy stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that I deal with it and I enjoy the
outcome after, like, and I'm willing to,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to wake up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when shit seems like it's falling
apart completely, get out of bed,
[SPEAKER_03]: go to the gym and live my life and know
that we're just going to do the best we
[SPEAKER_03]: can do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if shit's fucked up, we're going to
handle it the best we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and I think that's what
builds good companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the best way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I hope that's what's building our
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you on that, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a lot of fun meeting new
people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the podcast, we do a bunch of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, we got the book,
we got the podcast, we got the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got all these different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing R and D all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have all these different things in
these different directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, it's a lot of
fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really learn about yourself a lot
more by doing all these different things,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what you like, what you don't like,
the type of people you like to work with,
[SPEAKER_03]: the type of people you do not like to work
with, because there's a handful of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the suits, you know, I can deal with
some suits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind dealing with business people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mind dealing with guys that
are hippies, you know, like classic
[SPEAKER_03]: hippie, you know, it's like, cause some of
those guys have the best ideas and
[SPEAKER_03]: stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's, it's all about,
being able to interpret people's
[SPEAKER_03]: information too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generally not overthinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of corporate environment
stuff and they want to overthink things a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stony guys are always simplified.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like stoners because I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been fond of them since I was 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that in business, I like
dealing with people that smoke cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: that use the product, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That smoke cannabis, we're in cannabis,
let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't, that's okay too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to judge you on that,
but really like, we can relate on a
[SPEAKER_03]: different level.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're also a smoker, we can talk about
the flavor of it, the way it makes you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody like, then it becomes more
than money too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes something that we're both
passionate about something that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: dedicated my life to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's a, it's a beautiful
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never met a person that had grow that
didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people are in it, you know,
for the passion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been a couple of places I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all go, Hey, we can't smoke here,
but we can go over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're in this, we're in this
commercial world now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have friends that are really good
growers that don't smoke, but I have
[SPEAKER_03]: friends that are really good growers that
do smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, a mix of in between some
guys smoke a very little and, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, I love the way it makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love talking about it 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my friends can't handle how much I
like talking about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, it's what excites me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of relates to the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this, this is my forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to see wine and weed
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think wine and weed is going to be a
staple together because there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's such a perfect marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pairs with this Pinot Noir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a natural progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a question on that related
to the wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, someone said this, your old
friend about the wine industry creating
[SPEAKER_01]: like the bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating basically the cannabis industry,
creating the same type of thing where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's terroirs or there's regions and
like, you grow the best, whatever strain
[SPEAKER_01]: you want up in Humboldt and then up in
Sonoma County is a different strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think that's actually, Oh,
it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already in the process of happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think however we can support the growers
that are still around in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino, Trinity, Sonoma, especially
because I'm California, all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States in wine, they have AVAs,
viticultural areas.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in cannabis, but based on terroir
and location, I think it's great because
[SPEAKER_03]: if you grow sour diesel, for instance,
I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you grow that in Mendocino on the
coast, as opposed to inland, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get a different product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to go grow it in Napa County
versus Sonoma, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: different product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially with outdoor where you have
one cycle a year, it's heavily influenced
[SPEAKER_03]: by the environment, the minerality,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all conversations we all need to
be having, but then also going to the
[SPEAKER_03]: winery and tasting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to winery and I want to taste
that sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where they've grown around the area
and like you go to the actual facility and
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see it up close and personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a big, it would be
huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the winery, the winery model has
already been established, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already the brewery models,
like the microbrewery and the brewery
[SPEAKER_03]: model where you do the tasting and you get
the tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's already been done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the footwork has been laid for
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: By the alcohol industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we just need to take bits and pieces
to make it make sense for us and to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to push that forward because
everybody wants to go up to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about everybody, but I
definitely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of my friends would love to
go to a grow, especially harvest season
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can go talk or watch them
harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you're seeing the fresh
stuff come down and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or some breeder, we got Jackson,
uh, me and Gene from Freeborn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to go see his farm where he's
harvesting his genetics and see his new
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff for the year, where he's either
pheno hunting stuff or he's breeding new
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, there's a ton of guys in
the industry where it's like, I would love
[SPEAKER_03]: to go see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about Huckleberry Hill Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love, you know, you could go up
there and you get the tour and you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: a different version of what I think is
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would love to, to where that's like,
you know, you just basically have a
[SPEAKER_03]: reservation just like with the wine room
where you get a reservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You call their number.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the private tasting room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get your smoking jacket in,
you know, there's all kinds of ways they
[SPEAKER_03]: could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in California, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, in California with this new law,
maybe that would be fast paced that a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they really need direct sales from
farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's just a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're a ways from them being mixed
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we're far away from
having them separated in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, you know, you'll have wine
and cannabis in the same environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you won't have cannabis in the wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want cannabis in my wine
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love good wine and I love good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do not want any of that good weed in
my good wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you just negated both.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know you didn't create a better
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we haven't tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hope somebody does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that person wins, but it's not,
I'm not going to test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put tobacco in beer one time when I was
brewing beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to brew beer back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to make sake.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've brewed beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now why did you put tobacco?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I figured I wanted tobacco beer
because I used to smoke cigarettes and it
[SPEAKER_03]: was okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beer was okay if you smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you didn't, you would get sick and
you'd have problems both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that didn't go very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grab tobacco with tomatoes,
it makes a poisonous tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta be careful what you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco is a pretty strong product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a tendency of taking over what
it's cooked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years ago, a guy mixed it and came out
with a poisonous tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killed some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a few people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take two tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's going to try everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so if people are looking to find out
more about you guys, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our website's horizonlift.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all of our tutorial videos,
installation videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much anything that you'd want is
either on our website or on YouTube at
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizon Lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great program running with
Grow World as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow World is a great company to bring
people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've joined Grow World and Grow World
runs a program to where they'll sample our
[SPEAKER_00]: product out, capture what the person
thinks about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they like it, they keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, they return it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a great platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known Nick for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate him taking us on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's actually been nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have our first trial going
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just signed up with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have someone in Sutherland,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great feature, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a free lift to try for your first
grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know whether you get to put it
through all of its paces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can tell us how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a way that we can actually
get a little more documentation to by
[SPEAKER_01]: showing people what they're doing on their
weekly grow, how the Horizon Lift is
[SPEAKER_01]: helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel it's a win-win, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel like every person who's going
to do the trial, if they do it properly
[SPEAKER_01]: and right, they're going to end up
ordering more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a sale for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, we at least get to collect
that data and prove our concept more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying not to do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people in the industry who are
actually going to be doing it from not a
[SPEAKER_01]: biased perspective, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I'm trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you get people from Girl World,
and the beauty of it is they're interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in your product already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if they're interested enough to try
it and then they get good results,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to order more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their model's pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the other ambassadors, like myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an ambassador for Girl World.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beauty of what Girl World does with me
is I can pick and choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say, yeah, I want to work with this
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't want to work with that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's some products I believe
in, and there's other ones I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I don't believe in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to put my name and attach
my name to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they do a pretty good job of
filtering out most of that stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like that I have the end decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the podcast is a great platform
for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can do a lot of good research
and development for some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: companies and sharing the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm all about sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, I want everyone to
win, the people I work with especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, the manufacturer is not the
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people that are good at making
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person that makes the product is
generally not very good at marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're product development
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run into some issues sometimes when
you've got one effort going and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have part of the other effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our introduction to you and the help
we've gotten from you is imperative
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't do social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And social media, as we know, is what's
happening today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're terrible at it and we're not very
good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just being honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everybody has their strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are going to be at MJ Biz together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a booth there and I will be
at the booth every day for a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people want to come see me and hear
about my experiences with the lifts,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the videos that we make here in
the facility will be there at MJ with you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a couple of lifts at
the show that we're going to be showing
[SPEAKER_01]: and operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a power meter with
the PPFD reader, just showing you how
[SPEAKER_01]: little you have to move your lights to
drastically change your PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part was really amazing, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that the very slight movements
can completely make a big difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that I found
interesting is what one inch of movement
[SPEAKER_00]: can do to least surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one inch of movement can be four
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wow, that is extremely
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you start playing with your
distances and you go, wow, here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a fun product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some really good success with it
and multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we said, you know, hard to get
the word out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one last question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on turning your
lights down from 100% to 50%, 25%?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you know, I'm not a lighting
technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have seen some testing done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does not just equally go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these units, there's multiple
drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're turning them down,
some drivers turn down further than other
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrums change.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in no way whatsoever am I saying
they're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the chance is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not an exact science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we started looking at LEDs
three years before they came out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, you know, and we just kept shaking
our heads going, these don't grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these don't grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluence came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Fluence was the first light we got a
hold of, put it a bunch over some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and went, they are responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was the breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody went.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the game changer broke through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now here comes technology storming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think 86 manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: First show I went to.
[SPEAKER_00]: First MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: 86 brick and lighting manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: One ship, 86 manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where those lights are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not 86 factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, you know, factories making
multiple lights under different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's, it's kind of a
crap shoot right now to sort through the
[SPEAKER_00]: good and the bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the funny thing is that has a way of
surfacing itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad have tendency of fading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see that over the next couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot more light
technology that's going to be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, it's the early cell phone
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in a few more years,
you're going to see some, some really neat
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff with, you know, variating spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like right beyond that Motorola flip
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are right there with the big Motorola
phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's, you know, I think we've
made strides, huge strides, but we still
[SPEAKER_03]: have some really big strides to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light tuning wouldn't be necessary if they
had the right frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you've got some other
things to look at going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're running out of Pete.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Coco's expensive to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Cork?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard Cork, you know, I don't know
anybody that wants to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think DNA genetics, they were launching
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember who they were partnered
with, but they're going to do Cork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cork is a substrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Cork goes also, there's like a limited
amount of Cork.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, the growth of the
industry is going to have an impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: renewables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at some pace we'll outpace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you used to go by soil yards
and stuff and you would see the big black
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains that have been sitting there for
a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those aren't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the raw material is moving much
too fast to keep replenished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's making a hole
somewhere in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I think, you know,
going forward, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's going to be a lot of
things that come into this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden it's like,
you grew it for how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll all scratch our heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I still, you know,
raise my hat to the craft growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the craft guys are out there for
a reason, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generally the old hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're growing for flavor and taste
and all the things that we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an issue of this is the only way
I got to pay my bills.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bless them because, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still doing it because they love
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there will always be those people,
I hope, that grow this plant just out of
[SPEAKER_03]: love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Devotion and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, the craft farmer is
having a child and he wants to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a grower like his dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be that generational
grower that I think we're going to see for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you're going to see other
entities pushing and shoving and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, changing the game a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to change with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A guy from the eighties doing a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to change with the
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a great podcast,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to doing this again and
doing it in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll get you guys up there when
we're talking at the Grow World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up shortly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just by the time this airs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be right there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, James.
