[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today our special guest is Rachel
Savaloya.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the founder of Whole Plant
Medicinal and the CEO of Amber Alchemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing fantastic, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a long history.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are married to my good friend Marlon
Asher.
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider you guys family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad you could make it on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, we've had Marlon on here twice on
this and a few times on my other podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been to some reggae shows together
for sure and had some good times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the most amazing daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, she is so special, just the highlight
of our lives for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a blessing to be her mama.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's just every time I see her,
she's grown so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Marlon was showing me videos of her
singing and it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she is following right along in her
daddy's footsteps.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's always setting up stages and getting
up there and watch this, mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she'll do a beautiful dance and
she makes up songs all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for us to hang out at Reggae
on the River.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should be a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming up quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about your
jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a busy person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like the Ryan Seacrest of cannabis
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you recently moved to Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are transitioning, you know,
and little by little.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love the peaceful lifestyle and just
being that we're surrounded by nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to be in that and
surrounded by nature and raise our
[SPEAKER_01]: daughter there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll be coming back to the States
often, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to be mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here and follow daddy around when
we're on tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a very entrepreneurial
mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you're a hardworking
individual and you're constantly creating
[SPEAKER_02]: new things and new ideas and you're
opinionated in a great way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like you always have
contributions to the conversation and you
[SPEAKER_02]: have interesting perspective on a lot of
things that I've done and that everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love being creative and, gosh,
cannabis is such a creative gift,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it's such a guide for being
creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love making formulations ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remember I've been interested in
plants and natural medicine, and I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: so glad to be working with this plant and
it has so much to offer the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing because what you put in,
you get back with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot to be said for
owning a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you have to be creative as a
business owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be able to not only be
creative and come up with something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: different and unique that the world needs,
but you also have to grind and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: work hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw you going around to all these
dispensaries and, you know, putting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's something to be said
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the younger generation is kind
of losing some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing it, it just gets me excited,
especially about cannabis and people being
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've you've been successful in your
own right with your cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, James, when you when you find that
passion in your life, it just makes you so
[SPEAKER_01]: driven to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, my passion is really,
truly just to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been a lot of time and energy
put into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's paying off in so many ways and
hearing people's stories of healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just glad to be able to be part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's one of the biggest
takeaways from our guests lately is the
[SPEAKER_02]: gratitude for being part of it and part of
this thing that's so much bigger than
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like so amazing having a podcast
and having other guests that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: super grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like living in gratitude, you know,
because I think that's half of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world's not a great place all the
time, but there is beauty and there is
[SPEAKER_02]: greatness going on at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is sacred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is special.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it in the right mindset and
sitting in gratitude and reminding
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves every day and every moment in
life can get so tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just coming back to being in gratitude
can really change things and help shift
[SPEAKER_01]: things so that things can flow better for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so how did you get started with all
this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you were doing it before we met
even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I met Marlon because we both
are passionate about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met at Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got started, you know, in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couch surfer came and stayed with me at
my house for about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was telling me about this thing
called trimming and how I can make some
[SPEAKER_01]: money doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was going to go back to Grass
Valley and do trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought, you know, I'm finishing
up college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Burning Man and then go to
Grass Valley and go trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started with that and got to know a
bit about how cannabis is cultivated and
[SPEAKER_01]: just got to know the plant a bit and
started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always I mean, I went to school for
science and my background is science
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very interested in knowing what
studies have been done with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My my passion grew a lot more after my
dear family member found out that he had a
[SPEAKER_01]: basal cell skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was going to have to get a
surgery to remove a good chunk of his
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the doctors were saying a golf ball
sized piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, I said, hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what else we can find here to
help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I learned about Rick Simpson and
how he was making this oil and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: healing his skin cancer on his face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to acquire some herbs and and
drew YouTube videos pieced together how to
[SPEAKER_01]: make my first batch of medicine and got it
to my family member.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went through a big transformation of
kind of looking pretty nasty for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: and oozing and peeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually it popped out some white
stuff and started healing back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, I just really became more
a lot more interested in what this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: can do and found it is so versatile and so
helpful for so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the proof is out there when you
look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there's so many great
stories and and maybe it doesn't heal
[SPEAKER_02]: every type of cancer, but it definitely
helps for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many more things than the average
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing that that I know
of that has so many profound uses that
[SPEAKER_02]: make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our bodies are designed with this
endocannabinoid system to process these
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when our endocannabinoid system is is
supported and toned with with these phyto
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, all other body systems can
come into harmony, into balance and be
[SPEAKER_01]: supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: All other organs and and even our brains
and the way that we think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be in more and better balance and
harmony.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, CBD and its ability to help
calm anxiety and depression and uplift us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even understand how they all work
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're just scratching the surface
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think part of that is because it's
so subjective to the individual because we
[SPEAKER_02]: all work with the plant a little bit
differently and it helps us out in
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like stuff that's narcotic
and some people like stuff that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people like stuff that's
somewhere in between those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people use it for
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's just so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does have anti-inflammatory
properties and it does have amazing things
[SPEAKER_02]: that are so subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got into it in 2009 and then that
evolved into Amber Alchemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Amber Alchemy started as a collective
and people were able to get medicine that
[SPEAKER_01]: would help them in all these various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to bring products to
dispensaries then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, when 2019 came,
that's when we launched Whole Plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinals, the brand that is in
dispensaries here in California as a
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've got three different types of
tinctures right now that people take
[SPEAKER_01]: sublingually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a daytime, a two-to-one sativa,
a one-to-one indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking the ratio of CBD to THC for
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a high CBD tincture for just
general tonic, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: General wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take it day or night anytime and
you probably feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've tried your tinctures over the
years and I think they're amazing and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think they work really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you use a full spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people just put CBD or just THC or
they're mono cannabinoids, whereas you're
[SPEAKER_02]: into the full spectrum and I think that's
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's not just a full spectrum of
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of times in dispensaries,
products are labeled this way and it might
[SPEAKER_01]: be like a CO2 extracted product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it's got all of those
wonderful non-polar cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, but then we're leaving out all
of the polar molecules, the flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: stilonoids, lignans.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many different types of
therapeutic pieces here and it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it all has synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all just works so much better as a
whole when it's kept together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the solvent that does that the best is
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a high proof grain alcohol,
190 proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's food grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a high grade, pharmaceutical grade to
do our initial extractions, to make our
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually partnered with a great
company out of Nevada city called,
[SPEAKER_01]: their name is Floracy and they do all of
that initial extraction and we make all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the products right there out of Nevada
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you source your raw material?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we first want to make sure that the
flowers are grown organically and we try
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with regenerative farms that are
using regenerative methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've just worked with a few farms up
in that Nevada city area locally there to
[SPEAKER_01]: where Floracy is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them have actually gone out of
business at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rough out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be looking for new farms to work
with and partner with here again soon for
[SPEAKER_01]: our next batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: With legalization, it's kind of changed
the landscape of everything for better and
[SPEAKER_02]: for worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen this consolidation phase go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've had a couple of consolidation
phases, but initially first ones to
[SPEAKER_02]: market, the product wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're starting to stabilize,
but we're going through another
[SPEAKER_02]: consolidation phase where people are being
bought out or they're going out of
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's making it difficult for
everybody, especially the people trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: source good raw material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of organic isn't
necessarily the cheapest way to go as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as for creating a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it difficult when you're trying
to do it the right way sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish that the rest of the agricultural
world had the same types of very strict
[SPEAKER_01]: testing requirements and that we weren't
allowed to just poison everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feed it to all the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am happy about the standards that are in
place for protecting cannabis medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that at least when you go to
the dispensary, you can be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: confident that what you're getting is not
going to be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I've heard people can edit their
tests and stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're really cracking down on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of labs have closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but yes, I heard that people were
getting by with testing more real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the standardization with testing
has a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're making progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's awareness,
which is where it all begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, OK, well, we've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we fix it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's happening on the
state level with testing, with labs
[SPEAKER_02]: closing that aren't doing a proper job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think all that stuff should be
standardized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things we made a mistake on
in the beginning with California was not
[SPEAKER_02]: standardizing the lab testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we see that we just talked about it
on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 45% THC, or even total cannabinoids,
45%.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you tested a different lab and
it's 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these things need to be
standardized so it's an even playing field
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the consumer needs to understand
that THC isn't everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think so many people are
convinced that high THC is what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're someone who's new to the
industry, new to cannabis, you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for some way of telling what's better than
the other products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They assume high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, it's almost high terpenes
would be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be a better justification for
something if you were going for a number.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also educating on the dispensary
level for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they come in, there's an educated
person that can give them good
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the testing, having an idea of
how many milligrams a person is consuming,
[SPEAKER_01]: you certainly don't want to start somebody
out with 15 milligrams of THC or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to end up not wanting to try
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, dosage is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to tinctures,
I really love that you can dial in it in
[SPEAKER_01]: and start strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier to dial in than flour
and then smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like with that, if you tried two
milligrams because you're scared,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you could try five milligrams the
next day and it might be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you need to go to 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, OK, 10 milligrams is
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after a while, you're like,
oh, I have a tolerance, so I need to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more and a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with smoking, it's kind of all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you never know what you're going to
get necessarily as far as effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, each strain can be different and it
could be the same amount of THC in that
[SPEAKER_01]: joint that you have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the terpenes are going to one of
them will make you super paranoid and the
[SPEAKER_01]: other one will make you just chill out and
fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I prefer smoking, but I think
that edibles and consumables like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a whole bunch of new
products that are out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that those things are a
blessing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like it's all great and it's so
much for the individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like smoking is the best way for my
body for consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other people, you know, edibles work
and edibles just kick my butt for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can't if if I take 10 milligrams,
I'm not going to go to sleep right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whereas if I smoke a big joint,
I'm going to be tired and I'll pass right
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a high tolerance, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have a high tolerance with
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with edibles, no, like I can smoke and
smoke and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon and I sit there and smoke out,
you know, and it's like, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no problem and just puffing and
puffing and puffing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, like high tolerance, you know,
whereas edibles, if I take 10 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't necessarily go to sleep that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's so much and your body processes
are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting a process through the
liver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think there's also
benefits to that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like THCA in the edible form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think eating, it doesn't get me
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get this, you know, it's
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with a lot of people these
days that are, you know, going through
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer treatment and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking is, I think, ideal for the
anti-nausea effect because it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you're trying to take a
tincture that might bring it on even more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you can hold it down,
yeah, maybe it's going to help you with
[SPEAKER_01]: the nausea, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it takes me an hour and a half
before I feel the effects of the edible
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tincture, your tincture is kicking
pretty fast actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hold it under the tongue for a
minute, that usually, and the other key is
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to take it on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it will delay it for about an
hour.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you smoke, you feel it pretty
much right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I smoked some creeper for the
first time in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mother's weed from, or mom's weed
from Huckleberry Hill farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the real creeper is the real deal
where you smoke it and you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should smoke some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I smoked a bunch and then like,
I sat down and was playing trivia and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, wait a second, I'm super ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because there's all
these different effects and we're just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to categorize it all and figure it
all out now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I have fun with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all been amazing up to this point and
it's all from here on out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only going to get better in some ways
and yeah, and more exciting for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about the synthetic or
not really synthetic, but cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that are extracted from other sources?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's THCV and- Converted from
hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I used to hate on everything new
before I'd understand it fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like I'm past that in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll be THCV extracted from algae.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's going to be the same thing as
coming from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a huge THCV fan anyway,
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like my jam, but- I've heard
recently that it's really helpful for
[SPEAKER_01]: neural neuropathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I want to explore it
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a study that came out last,
not last year, but a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's like, it's so
subjective again, so subjective to the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual what works for one person,
you know, like, I mean, I, and I like a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: My spectrum of stuff that I enjoy is
really broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that I like the gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the OGs, but I also like the good
sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the good super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like some really wild stuff that's
unique and different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always looking for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that excites me trying stuff that's
new, but I'll still go back to smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: some Skittles or some gelato, even though
people are hating on gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are, even though it's the most
popular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's wild how we do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we form these trends, like as a
society, what's popular now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, social media plays this
big role in what's popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times you can't smell or
taste the stuff through the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're like, that looks the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get purple punch, purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with Oreos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look so good, but then you go to
smoke them and they just, they don't do it
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste wise, effect wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think there's a tie in with
the taste and the effect, but how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think it relates to tinctures?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have some something that smells
great, looks great, gets you high grade,
[SPEAKER_02]: it should turn into a great tincture or a
great consumable edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as long as it's got plenty of
resin in there, then it's going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: good cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm picking strains for tinctures,
I'm looking for terpenes that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give me the effects that most people are
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a good strong indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Northern Lights and Afgu for
that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I help people to seek those kind of
strains out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a good Afgu.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you know anybody, because I haven't
had Afgu in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that sweet Afgu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whitest stuff back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time I saw it in
Sonoma and it was just caked and I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: it was fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked like a flocked Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sativas, I mean, I like Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you had a podcast recently talking
about it for a second, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a really gentle sativa that can help
people get into that creative space and
[SPEAKER_01]: feel good and get a little bit of an
appetite going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I like banana strains and hazes
for sativas for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to like sativas better than
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I made a whole bunch of bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon and I are going to be going to the
Caribbean later this year and gifting some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these crosses that are very exclusive
to St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we are going to be sharing these
genetics that we made specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, their economy was focused on
bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their economy was built around bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great match, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being able to gift banana in the
form of cannabis back to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Marlon and I made a promise when we
were there last time that we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come back with some banana crosses and we
have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we imported seeds legally into the
country, one of our last visits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was an amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people were just so amazing and so
nice there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just went through a really bad
hurricane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they seem to have the problems as
far as they had an earthquake.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a volcano a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a crazy volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just had a hurricane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a beautiful country, beautiful
island, small island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got small vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that vibe of a small place with
amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of the experiences where I
got to experience poverty on a different
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me realize how grateful I am
for what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people were just so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was kids that had never had
shoes before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have never met kids that had never
had shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me feel sad in some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in other ways, I saw that they were so
happy with so little.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it takes experiences like
that for you to step back and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, it's not about these materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the material things that we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes happiness can come from inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can come from family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can come from other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when things aren't working out,
you can still be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are probably so much more
grounded and connected to this earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: not having this piece of rubber in between
them and the dirt.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something to be said for grounding
and to be connected to the earth like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they used to make fun of all the
hippies doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's turning out that we got
scientists talking about how valuable
[SPEAKER_02]: grounding is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they come out with sheets to put on
your bed, to plug into your wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: to ground your bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how we were saying that butter
was bad, and then margarine's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now margarine's bad and butter's good,
which is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how they pushed that agenda for
a long time about margarine being good and
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so many things that are synthetic
aren't necessarily good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're still all just figuring all this
science stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the people that are seeking
my advice, I do coaching, like health
[SPEAKER_01]: coaching, and definitely bring in cannabis
medicine into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just what people are going through in
their health and how we're just so
[SPEAKER_01]: bombarded every day with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemicals in our food, in our air,
in the clothes we wear, and the lotions
[SPEAKER_01]: and shampoos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in our furniture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty amazing we're still alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bodies just keep on going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more poison and toxins than
ever before in human history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're able to adapt to them to a
degree and find homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of us, but some of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild how we can adapt to almost
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our oceans are completely poisoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food we eat has a tenth of the
nutrition that it did, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a strange time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're looking at it from that
perspective, it's amazing that we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's amazing how resilient the human
body is and how we can adapt and evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plant medicine, we went away from
plant medicine for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now we're going back into plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The awareness is coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting to be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all starts with awareness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can become aware of it,
then we can start researching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have this amazing tool,
the internet, communication and
[SPEAKER_02]: technology, to where we can research stuff
at a far greater and faster rate than we
[SPEAKER_02]: ever could before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if used correctly, it's an amazing
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also be used incorrectly and
totally mess people up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it's so helpful for people when
they're becoming their own advocates for
[SPEAKER_01]: their health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't want to go with the
mainstream way and just be funneled
[SPEAKER_01]: through this healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can go online and find for
themselves plants and supplements that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help support their bodies or
detox their bodies and methods to do all
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all at their fingertips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really wonderful that that exists
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many things that are a
blessing and a curse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think used in moderation,
so many of these things can be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many things done correctly can be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many things used incorrectly can be
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cannabis being legal, finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not finally federally legal,
but it's rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a twist to all this rescheduling now,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to change things for
dispensaries, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know full yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we assume a lot, but that doesn't
mean anything because I feel like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, oh, the taxes, they're
potentially going to change and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Uncle Sam is going to go
away from wanting his kick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Uncle Sam is always going to want
his piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taxation is tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's over taxation in the
cannabis industry right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taxed on every step and Uncle Sam
gets his piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if we kind of change the tax
structure, it would make it easier for
[SPEAKER_02]: small businesses to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the biggest takeaway
that I have from all this is like small
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses are the ones that get affected
the most that are trying to go and survive
[SPEAKER_02]: in the legal cannabis industry across the
board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these are the things that got to
change for small business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is like big companies,
they can survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not even just for cannabis small
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for small businesses across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how this country is taxing
everybody just to put everybody at barely
[SPEAKER_01]: poverty level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same with cannabis though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worse, but it's still the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the same side, but it's rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the taxation just kills people,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in paying to the government to a
degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in paying taxes so that we can
make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could take the boxes on what we
want to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could have our taxes go toward that
would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the world would really make some
positive change.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because used correctly, taxes could
potentially make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole concept is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, and same thing with traffic
violations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a ticket, it should be going
for making the roads better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead now they've got all these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all crazy politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate talking about politics,
but this is one of those wild things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paying taxes is one of the things about
owning a business that just makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes not even want to own a business
because I do not like the way they're used
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't want to feed into that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't, then you can't run your
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the catch-22.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what the solution is
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it starts at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it starts at the top,
but it starts at the bottom and it starts
[SPEAKER_02]: with small changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, but just tough, tough being a
small business owner in this day and age.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 years ago, it was all about small
business, you know, but that slowly went
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in cannabis too, it starts out,
you know, with all these small businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: that get consolidated into bigger
businesses, into bigger businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're left with the big four or
the big three or the big five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dive back into your companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got started with the dispensaries
and then you're across how many
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're mostly focusing right now
around regionally around the Nevada city
[SPEAKER_01]: area, branching out to Sacramento and up
to like Tahoe and Chico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're about to look for more
distribution options.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the hustle part of,
of what you've done, because I saw you
[SPEAKER_02]: hustling and a lot of people don't
understand how it works going into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, working with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw you going to the dispensaries,
showing up, you would educate and you did
[SPEAKER_02]: it over and over and you were constantly
doing deliveries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the things that
impressed me the most about you is that
[SPEAKER_02]: energy that you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think you, you went to so
many dispensaries in the area,
[SPEAKER_02]: even down here in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want to show your face and,
and tell the story about your company and
[SPEAKER_01]: why they should support those products and
make it really easy for them to share that
[SPEAKER_01]: information with the customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, you know, budtenders,
I mean, it's getting better these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they maybe weren't so up to date on
information on, you know, when people are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in for this or that ailments,
they, they didn't quite know how to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what direction to point them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a lot of the, you know,
the educational piece and letting them
[SPEAKER_01]: know like, you know, how much do you give
a certain, a certain person or which
[SPEAKER_01]: products to recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you can't give out a free sample in
California, unfortunately, it'd be great
[SPEAKER_02]: if you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they made it hard for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smell the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can't even go transport my own
company's product to the dispensary at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to hire the distribution
company to deliver your samples and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all on manifests and gets charged in tax
and all that good stuff.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We donate to, um, compassion programs as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, uh, there's a dispensary in
Nevada city called elevation, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they've got a great program where
monthly people who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in need of product and, but don't have the
financial ability to support that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: go in and get some tinctures or
concentrate oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think giving back is so huge,
uh, for people, especially they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: afford medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately the medicine is not free,
uh, but when you're able to give back,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should give back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that just goes across the
board with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you, uh, you know, in life I've
been really depleted financially and I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember saying, okay, this is like my
last, uh, money here, but more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, knowing that more is going to
come and, um, just still being giving
[SPEAKER_01]: with, uh, you know, maybe at that time I
don't didn't have work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go and I, and I, you know,
donate my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I help people and it always comes back and
it always just life supports you when,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're giving back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think some people give up and I
think that's the difference between the
[SPEAKER_02]: successful people and the people that
don't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you just can't give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when it's the toughest or the
hardest and you think it's all falling
[SPEAKER_02]: apart, sometimes it's just one more day or
one more week and it's all going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest takeaway is that it's all going
to be okay anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end it's all okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, let's talk about the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know you've gone on multiple
vacations to Trinidad and the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what's your favorite part about
the Caribbean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely the, the festive atmosphere
and just everybody is, um, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just really want to experience joy
and happiness in their day and they
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrate a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just always some fun
event to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also, I, you know, I, as a white
American woman, I'm quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: differences from my Rastafari husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, one of the biggest ways
that he teaches me is just how to slow
[SPEAKER_01]: down and relax and enjoy life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really good at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, sometimes he just, you know,
you just need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to smoke another joint or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, you know, it's like whatever it is
to get you to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's very good at relaxing and he
has that relaxed mindset, even in the most
[SPEAKER_02]: stressful things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I'm stressed out, he's usually
the one that's like, he's chill and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great having that balance for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's just, it's a good balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, for him, you know, I'm,
I'm always, you know, trying to encourage
[SPEAKER_01]: him to, to be creative and think big,
you know, um, he's so talented.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talented.
[SPEAKER_02]: His voice is, is magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gift from God and there's no other
way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's an, it's one of those
natural talents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so amazing to hear, even when,
you know, nobody's listening like,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's just us hanging out and he sings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's amazing that he has that
voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause God gives us, gives us all with
different talents and some are obvious and
[SPEAKER_02]: some are not obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some take a long time for you to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, maybe even a lifetime to
find, whereas some are just so obvious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like his voice is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had to work in a lot of different
areas in order to eventually, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get to where he was recognized and,
and able to do this full time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the music industry is tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people think, Oh yeah,
you've got a natural talent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's no, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes a lot of effort and believing
in yourself, even when other people don't.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and having good people around you,
I think that's so important with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with everything in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to surround yourself with good
people because the wrong people can steer
[SPEAKER_02]: you the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those times, it's like,
you just gotta let them pass through and
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all, all of the other beautiful things
that you want to create in your life are
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to blossom while everything
else just passes by.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not to give it our energy and allow
it to take hold on us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeding into bad energy and it's easy to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so, it's almost easier to feed into
stuff sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then ignore it or to just let it pass
by, you know, it's like, I've learned from
[SPEAKER_02]: social media and it's like people,
you know, sometimes you just ignore stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so let's talk about genetics and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like to consume?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking about smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh, I'm, I'm so happy to be around
Marlon, who's the true connoisseur and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's always got access to all this high
quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like flowers that are going to
maintain their flavor all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes I'm not even like,
I don't even know if I'm so strain
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, like, Oh, I really love these
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I don't even really pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it smells good and it's
burning well, you know, that it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have a bunch of fertilizers or
nutrients still in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's burning clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing I'm looking for when
I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on the Rolans?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to kind of hate on Marlon about it
and like, come on, get rid of the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, such a Caribbean thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the camouflage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I like the, the smoothness of,
of the pole when, when you have that
[SPEAKER_01]: filter on there and the tobacco is such a
nice match with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, I smoke those these days as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little tobacco mixed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke tobacco if I can help it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, when I'm down in the
Caribbean, like whatever, I'll smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but yeah, I try not to smoke
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I smoked tobacco for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked cigarettes a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might give me a good cigar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like cigars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke cigars, but, uh, tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends that do the bonger up with
the tobacco, not my jam necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I know, and I don't smoke every
day either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke probably a couple of times a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well being around Marlon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, I, I love the, the smell and
it sure, you know, makes me want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: roll one up myself when he's out there
three, four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, but, uh, I've been trying to
just be a little more intentional about it
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I mean, right now I'm on a path
of really like uncovering, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my, my true purpose in life and,
and, um, just trying to be a good leader
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, for my daughter, you know,
and, um, just discovering more about
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, releasing things that don't serve
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis and being in meditation with
cannabis can really help me to see those
[SPEAKER_01]: things and, um, you know, help shake it
off and, and, and move energy that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have clinging on to me in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cannabis is so special too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like, uh, it reveals you to
yourself sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we're assholes or sometimes
we're, uh, you know, we, we see ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: different than how we really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes when you smoke, I know I'm
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke, I reveal my, and I think
that's why some people don't like smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: too is because it reveals them to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but, but I love that part about
cannabis is it kind of puts the world back
[SPEAKER_02]: into perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so same thing with psychedelics and
same thing with other forms of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of reveal you to yourself in a
way that only they can do.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just about remembering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's just about remembering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, cause, cause ego is, ego is the son of
a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ego is tough and we're fighting ego every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, and, and the world we live
in is based on you and material objects
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's all based around ego and having
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes going away from that and,
and, you know, smoking lots of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that kind of puts the world back
into perspective for some people,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, especially, I think living in
gratitude, being grateful for stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always, you can't go wrong there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you can count your blessings
every day or say positive things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think positive affirmation for what
we're doing, like if we were able to give
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves, not just giving it to others,
because I think it's easy to give positive
[SPEAKER_02]: affirmation and positive words to others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we just need to do it to
ourselves and remind ourselves that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: good people too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so many people get down on themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just keep repeating those
thoughts and stories that we have about
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves and about others that really
give us all of the suffering, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and pain and suffering is good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people want to stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're scared of hard work, especially
like a lot of people are scared of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, pain and they, they don't want their
children to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just a natural instinct,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but a lot of stuff is so much reality
is so much of the opposite of what we
[SPEAKER_02]: think sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want our children to suffer
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to experience enough pain so
they can appreciate how good they have it
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding duality and uh, so
counterintuitive, the world we live in is
[SPEAKER_02]: just so counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of stuff is the opposite of
how we think it is, you know, from,
[SPEAKER_02]: from one perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just having these conversations is
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it can be so the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times I'll have stories,
you know, that, that are creating,
[SPEAKER_01]: shaping the way I'm viewing a situation or
a person and, and, uh, ask five other
[SPEAKER_01]: people and they all have a completely
different perspective of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is real is how you see it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there's multiple realities
because it's however you see it through
[SPEAKER_02]: your lens and based on the experiences
you've had in your life, you see it
[SPEAKER_02]: differently through those lenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one person's reality can be
completely different from another
[SPEAKER_02]: person's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, it's, and it goes on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's 7.3 and 5 billion different
realities going on all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're part of this collective
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much greater than ourselves and
we're so interconnected and we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: separate ourselves, but we're really all
tied in together in this bigger fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are one and we need to realize that and
yeah, just start working together and
[SPEAKER_01]: building this beautiful world back up into
what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're both Finnish American.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's great heritage,
great heritage, strong people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong willed people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some of the strongest willed people I
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm speaking for my father.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the strongest willed person I know in
some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think our heritage is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having, having that, I think, uh,
you know, but, but also realizing that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're part of the bigger picture too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self or for your daughter that
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to go into the cannabis industry,
what would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_01]: To really just follow your intuition
because so many times I've, I've made a
[SPEAKER_01]: choice that I knew inside wasn't the right
way to go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was hopeful that it was the right
way to go with it, but, um, I ended up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, really losing out on a lot of,
you know, time invested into a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship or, um, financial investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, if I would have just listened to
that inner voice, um, and moved a little
[SPEAKER_01]: slower, a lot of times just was trying to
get there first and like get on the shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: before somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, um, that might, that may have
set me back in the end.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going at your own pace, but,
um, just remembering always why you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this and, and having that at the
center of every thing that you do in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had some stories you wanted to
share about some of the people that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to, um, see, I'll start with a
dear friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, her father was going through late
stages of dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at the point where he couldn't
hardly speak anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would just kind of repeat the same
couple of words and mumble and be hunched
[SPEAKER_01]: over in his chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started working with him with only full
spectrum CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a few days, he started being
able to, um, put, put sentences together
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, ask for, you know, what he was
needing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after a couple of weeks,
he started going back into being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, he, he said to his daughter,
come sit by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell you about my dear friend
back in 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and so this guy was a big influence on
my life for this reason and this reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he totally came back and was able to
be present for the last couple of years of
[SPEAKER_01]: his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that was really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I just, I, that's happened a few
times with people who have been going
[SPEAKER_01]: through dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it just helps reignite the brain and,
and recover their ability to think and
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate again and, and remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, uh, I've also worked with,
uh, you know, guiding some, some parents
[SPEAKER_01]: with, um, a child who was autistic and is
autistic, um, nonverbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a few months of taking the oil,
he was singing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within, uh, you know, a few months later,
he was learning another language on the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer and being able to speak both,
um, I think the, the native language was
[SPEAKER_01]: Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he started learning, um,
English on, on the computer and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it totally changed his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've worked with people who have used
cannabis medicine alone, um, to completely
[SPEAKER_01]: recover from cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, lymphoma is, is one, um,
uh, as, as a support and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in conjunction with, with like,
uh, another, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another client of mine used cannabis oil
and immunotherapy and their doctors were
[SPEAKER_01]: blown away by their progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to, uh, eventually get to
be completely cancer free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and the doctor said the
immunotherapy wasn't supposed to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just supposed to help stabilize
things and give you some more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've worked with people who are on
high blood pressure medications and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, being able to stabilize
and regulate blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one client of mine, her husband was
having a very high blood pressure was they
[SPEAKER_01]: were about to go to the emergency room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put some CBD oil under his tongue and
within 20 minutes he was able to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: start feeling a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within an hour, the blood pressure was
completely normal again, and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but just getting people off of
medications, pain meds, especially,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, even anti-inflammatories, NSAIDs,
getting people off NSAIDs because I think
[SPEAKER_02]: besides, you know, the hard stuff,
as far as the opiate type pain
[SPEAKER_02]: medications, a lot of people use NSAIDs
for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got this pain in their necks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take a anti-inflammatory,
they take ibuprofen, they take this or
[SPEAKER_02]: they take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nothing wrong with using those
occasionally, but over time they build up
[SPEAKER_02]: in your system and they're really,
really bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clog up your liver and, um, and do damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Severe damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we talk about it enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis used correctly can be
an anti-inflammatory and maybe it's worth
[SPEAKER_02]: exploring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it won't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it will, but it's worth at least
trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's my thought on the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I love the, I love working with pain
in like kind of the one, two punch where
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got the anti-inflammatory effects
of CBD and CBG, and then you have the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbing and pain relieving deep
effects of the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm, um, guiding a client,
usually what we'll do is we'll do some THC
[SPEAKER_01]: first, let that absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, you know, half an hour at
least later, they take the CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG component and, um, help calm the
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we don't do it at the same
time is because we really want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure we're dialing in the THC level to the
appropriate amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, CBD of course can block the
absorption of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it likes to bind to the receptors a
little stronger than THC can in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to separate those out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a topical?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, um, internal tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you used to have a topical that was
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought your topical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That topical, um, it's got, you know,
it's got the cannabis part in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it also has a bunch of other medicinal
herbs that are beneficial for pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, and, um, just speeding up
the regeneration of tissues and bones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got, it's got a comfrey in there
and that herb it's called bone knit,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just so good at making the
bones strong and tying them back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also, now I've got another topical
that is a combination of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: piece with castor oil and DMSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DMSO, it drives the oils in very deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you use it with castor oil-
That's what you gave me for the dog too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for Luna, my dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's passed, but yeah, the DMSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: DMSO does stink, but it's super,
it's amazing if used correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: DMSO can be amazing for absorbing drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being the area first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it'll absorb, it'll absorb your
dirt, your bacteria, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dye on your shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It stinks like onions a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not even really- Like burnt
rubber bands and like- It's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rotting smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the thing is, is with DMSO,
like it's, it might not smell that bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you start sweating, then it really
smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, um, for, for some
people there's like a chemical reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: that happens to where some people don't
smell much from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people really smell.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed if I put it, yeah,
if I put it on and cause I think it really
[SPEAKER_02]: works good with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you put it on and I start,
like, if I start moving around and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sweating and it's a hot day or something
like that, then I'm like, Oh, can't use
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff on hot days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in working with the
roots and, um, you know, just looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: a good source of roots that are clean and,
you know, don't have a bunch of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course plants generally, like once they
flowered, like the energy is sent up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I'd love to just grow some plants
for the roots and be able to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's an extremely high
concentration of terpenes, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with certain varieties of
cannabis, some of these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is like, if you've grown
and you've thrown away root balls,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of times you like, if you take it
out of the pot and cause you reuse pots
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're breaking up those root balls,
you'll get a good whiff of terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've noticed that some are stronger
than others, obviously, just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but yeah, I've, I've had some
amazing super chirpy roots before too,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I'm like, we should be extracting this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of money wasted
on not, not, you know, there's some useful
[SPEAKER_02]: products out there where I think there's
people that are good at using whole
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but like, there's so many uses for
every part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every last little part has some use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, they're making hempcrete,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a house built of hempcrete
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to get in on one of those
workshops sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're, we're building in
Costa Rica right now and want to build
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little studio for Marlin,
make it out of hempcrete or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least, you know, use the mud from
the land or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they do earth walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should look at the earth walls are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they withstand category five,
uh, hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's a combination of sand and
mud and clay and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my buddy in Mexico is building a whole
house of with earth balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you just gotta get a teacher and
then like host a workshop on your
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have everyone build it for you or at least
start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at least.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all this stuff is on YouTube now
with technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, you could learn how to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Costa Rica, how's the cannabis
scene down in Costa Rica?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've heard good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been able to explore that too
much at this point because we've only been
[SPEAKER_01]: there for, you know, a few months here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, people are definitely
interested in, in seeds and new strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the laws have shifted in Costa Rica to
where you can grow, uh, personal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for personal use, but you're not allowed
to sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I think that it's,
you know, about to blow up over there and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really get, get it to where more
people can access this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of like health clinics
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really interested in continuing my
work in Costa Rica and, uh, reaching out
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of those health clinics and,
you know, stay medicinal with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're considered tropical,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not equatorial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's they're, they're like in the,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a hundred percent on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I've heard some really
interesting stories about people growing
[SPEAKER_02]: OG, my friend, Tim, growing OG Kush here,
and then growing it in Costa Rica and how
[SPEAKER_02]: the same cultivar grown in two places
expresses completely different where you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't even recognize it as OG Kush
grown outdoor in Costa Rica compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: grown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm interested in seeing some of the
diversity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, uh, we want to get a little greenhouse
going and, and, you know, get our,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can do like six plants or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have to try out some of these
strains for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six, 20 footers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six plants legal in California,
but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no rule to how big they get or
size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bigger, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's so amazing that we're
going global with cannabis legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though it's not fully legal in the U
S Germany just legalized recreational as a
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, and it's just big,
when big countries like Germany move,
[SPEAKER_02]: then other countries will follow suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've got Columbia,
they're doing their, their medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, uh, they're doing export and,
you know, there's so many medical
[SPEAKER_02]: countries out there and also so many rec
countries coming online.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people are interested in finding out
more about you, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can go to my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole plant medicinals with an S um,
dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of great information on
there about the products and how they're
[SPEAKER_01]: made and, um, a link on there to reach out
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also my website, Amber alchemy.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's where my CBD line is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, my consultation
services, you can reach out to me through
[SPEAKER_02]: that website and they can order CBD direct
to their house, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Direct to consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of CBD.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can work with, uh, you know,
CBD, CBG, CBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other cannabinoids that I'm
working with in that company as well that
[SPEAKER_01]: are all legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have like, um, you know,
enough THC to actually be doing some good
[SPEAKER_01]: too with hemp these days, because I mean,
I was in the grocery store the other day
[SPEAKER_01]: and there is gummies and they're like five
milligrams of THC per gummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was surprised and I, and because
it's based on the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to start looking into
that a little further too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's totally based on the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So five milligrams, if the gummy weighs,
you know, three grams, that's way less
[SPEAKER_02]: than, yeah, you're under the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally under the limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and a lot of people are using the THC
a loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which, but, but the thing is,
is like, if it's a gummy and it's THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't really get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't understand it's Delta nine
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you high, but THC is
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does all these amazing things,
but it does not have the psychoactive
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
