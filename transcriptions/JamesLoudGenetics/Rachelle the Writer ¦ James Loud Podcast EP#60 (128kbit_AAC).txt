[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the James on
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today our special guest is Rochelle
Gordon, Rochelle, the writer.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: James, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like our roles have reversed
today because I feel like you've
[SPEAKER_03]: interviewed me a couple of times and I
feel like I get to interview you today and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love when the tables are turned.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've both been in the industry for a
while, a good amount of time and doing all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have really done amazing work writing,
you know, highlighting some of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: important people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a huge blessing, to be honest
with you, to be able to share the stories
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people who built this industry and
who are pioneering in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really, really humbling to
have people who are willing to open up to
[SPEAKER_00]: me and share and let me amplify their
message.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, there's some writers that have
big egos and I feel you're not one of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love that about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you do a great job with your
articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try really, really hard to stay humble
because I come from humble beginnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and honestly, like, this is not
about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about you and the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a team effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, writing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So writing a breeding book, I got my hands
dirty or my feet wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Writing a book took me five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I learned I think by the end of the
book, I really learned how to take my ego
[SPEAKER_03]: out of it and try to write the book for
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that I got everything right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's stuff that I definitely got wrong,
but I did the best I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a contribution of more than 20
people's work and a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I I am glad that I did it and
it's done and I don't have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think than people realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of people coming to me like,
oh, I want to maybe write a book or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, it's not just about typing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about putting passion and
knowledge and then you have to market it
[SPEAKER_00]: and like edit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just so much that goes into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five years is quite a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm super stoked for you that you got
it across the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me a copy at Weed Week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually at the hydro store down
the road right before I came here and I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw a bunch of copies of your book sitting
out on the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a full circle moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've written articles and I've gotten
my hands dirty with articles before I've
[SPEAKER_03]: written for a bunch of publications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I've written some good stuff,
but it's really about inserting something
[SPEAKER_03]: special in each article to really
highlight the person or what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: writing about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also just not writing to write.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of for me like doing a puzzle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I listen to the person's story and
I'll look for that narrative and that arc
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll pull the quotes and I'll put
it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you do it when you were writing
articles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, did you follow that same formula or
what was your process?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I reverse engineer everything in
my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how I do stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I start with a bunch of bullet
points and then I start trying to fill in
[SPEAKER_03]: the bullet points.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do with the book,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just I did it in the same way that
I read an article when I tried to tackle
[SPEAKER_03]: the book in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote five versions of the book
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done like literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I scratched the first version completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't say completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, you know, obviously there was
knowledge in my head that was put back on
[SPEAKER_03]: the paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like what was written?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirty thousand words.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book is one hundred and fifteen
thousand words total.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first thirty thousand,
I believe it was close to thirty got
[SPEAKER_03]: scrapped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had to redo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I thought I knew how to
write a good breeding book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I knew what I was doing and
I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially once I read it and I was like,
this is not worth putting out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at the end of the day,
writing is an art.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's the art behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also feel like when you have
something that's art, all you can do is
[SPEAKER_03]: the best you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got to put it out to the world
and the world judges it and the world
[SPEAKER_03]: accepts it and appreciates it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I love about books.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I love about articles and
articles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost more subtle because you're
writing about somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're having to figure out how to
highlight that person the best way
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and there's so many angles
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it's a lot of pressure,
especially when I really like and respect
[SPEAKER_00]: the person that I'm writing about,
because I so desperately want to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: right and try to do right by them and
amplify them in the way that they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually been really,
really fortunate that I've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully write articles that people
really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really had much pushback or you
misquoted me or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've heard horror stories from
other writers who, you know, they put out
[SPEAKER_00]: something and then the subject was upset
about how they came off or how they were
[SPEAKER_00]: presented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's happened to me before too,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like so grateful, but the
pressure is difficult and it gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll avoid writing the actual article
because I put so much pressure on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I try to do is just speak from
the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always one of the things that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if I can do that and
capture someone's essence, their truth
[SPEAKER_00]: will come through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Authenticity is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And capturing authenticity is even harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I think people just don't get
how hard it is to actually capture
[SPEAKER_03]: authenticity because that's just,
it's like one thing telling a story and
[SPEAKER_03]: then capturing the authentic side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just, it speaks so highly of
these authors that do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of them have big egos too
that do a good job, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, and there are some really good
writers out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're in a special time because
we've kind of gone away from print,
[SPEAKER_03]: not completely, because we're still doing
print and you're doing print.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing online digital stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing a little bit of everything,
but we've gone into like this mass
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum of different forms of media,
you know, social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have magazines still.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have digital magazines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just so many different versions of
stuff that you can read and get
[SPEAKER_03]: information from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a really interesting
evolution, especially with social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a journalist, especially working in
print, it's kind of a dying art in a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's still something really special
and magical about having a print copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure when you got your book
for the first time, you know, a special
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I love being able to give that gift
to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, we did a special insert for
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: We distributed it to a bunch of
dispensaries and then it was in the Sunday
[SPEAKER_00]: edition of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went out all across San Francisco and a
couple of the stories that were in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't tell the people that were the
subjects that it would be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were surprised like,
wow, I'm in the Chronicle, this legendary
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really cool gift to give to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you get your start in writing,
in cannabis, in cannabis writing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess let's take it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you start writing in high school and
just start with journals and then writing
[SPEAKER_03]: in school?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had a passion for writing when I
was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would write a lot of poetry and short
stories and I would journal a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I never really thought about writing
as a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I actually studied early
childhood education and social justice and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working as a teacher for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually ended up getting arrested,
not at school, after school, with some
[SPEAKER_00]: weight and lost my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to get into a drug court
scenario to fight my felony charges,
[SPEAKER_00]: because my addiction caused my crime and
was able to get through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't a felon, thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I lost my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up writing on the side as more
of a side hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was finding gigs, doing freelance stuff,
mostly sustainability, education,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got out of drug court and the
legal industry started happening around
[SPEAKER_00]: the country and I started finding gigs in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of right place,
right time sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm running a cannabis website
owned by the San Francisco Chronicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a really interesting
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often joke that if I hadn't gotten
busted, I wouldn't be where I am today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I reflect on a lot of that stuff
as I'm getting older, like stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to be so bad in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if you just breathe and you just
kind of move past it, and you just put one
[SPEAKER_03]: foot in front of the other, they can be
life changing things that were meant to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that everything happens the
way it's supposed to happen and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe puts you where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, at the time I was really
pissed and, you know, sad and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that this thing happened to me,
but it worked out for the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could be an equity partner in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go to a lot of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many events, like all of the events.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the events.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear you go to all the events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I used to go to a lot of events.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I look on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you on Instagram a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're at all the events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally all the... In fact,
I don't even know how you do it sometimes,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you got to Spannabis and you were in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the event that you were
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like two days before Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you jump over to Spain and you're
just, you know, jet setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a cool lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exhausting, but it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, again, never thought that would
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been able to go all over the
world writing about weed and meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a grind for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people often laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wow, you know, we don't
understand how you do it, how you are
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and breathing and putting out
articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like someone was commenting about,
I was at MJ Biz last year and I'd been
[SPEAKER_00]: going hard all week as one does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was literally Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the press booth and it's a big
glass kind of box on the show floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm writing an article that I have to
file immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are just like, are you serious
right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm just blessed to have a
brain that can compartmentalize and
[SPEAKER_00]: function and grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've always had that kind of
scrappy, hustler sort of nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: even as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess I just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do break down once in a great while
where I'm like, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I just put it into
perspective and think about what a
[SPEAKER_00]: blessing it is to have this life and to be
able to tell the stories and to share this
[SPEAKER_00]: information with people who so desperately
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's actually my real passion,
James, is the ability to advocate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and be a steward of the plant and
inform people who may not even realize
[SPEAKER_00]: what this plant could do for them or their
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one of the very first events I
ever did, I met a woman and she had a
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter who was born with an incredibly
rare condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was only supposed to have a life
expectancy of one year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started treating her with CBD
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was four years old at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this Hazel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, actually.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was crying, you know, and I couldn't
believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sharing that story meant so much to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me really realize that this
was what I was meant to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad had epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing up, and he was not treatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went in for a surgery to get his
brain corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a massive stroke and was
paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never walked again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had severe brain damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like in nursing homes my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He passed away in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long term complications from his stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing what we know now about epilepsy
and cannabis, I have no doubt that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant could have maybe saved his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never got the chance to try it
because we didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I just keep advocating,
telling those stories, telling Hazel's
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people need to know what this
plant can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And awareness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think education and awareness are
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people just need to be aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I feel like there's still this
stigma with the older generation that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that flour is drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think even with the schedule three
thing, now people are like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff they're smoking, that's not a
medical drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are using that just to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's a big part of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will never stop sharing and
advocating for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can do with the information
what they want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can at least have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I first got into this,
I had an aunt who was like, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: obsessed with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your career is never going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a shame of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally two years later,
she's like, hey, I have a friend who says
[SPEAKER_00]: she feels 20 years younger on the CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in that space, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get me some?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sometimes that's just what
it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a personal connection or something to
click.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I just won't stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanjay Gupta wrote the 60 Minute article.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that changed my parents' lives as far
as cannabis is concerned and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second you can put kids in front of
people and go, how do you have a right to
[SPEAKER_03]: judge a parent for giving a kid something
that could make their lives better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Judge a parent or a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can you take that away from
parents?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we're in a silly time where
people are still not getting it fully.
[SPEAKER_03]: But things are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the Schedule 3, as bad as it is,
it's good in a lot of other ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's the good and the bad with
it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for a lot of mainstream folks,
they see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the government for the first time is
admitting that there is medicinal benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the government can admit that,
I think that will be a spark for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of us in the industry, we kind of
know the nuances with rescheduling versus
[SPEAKER_00]: descheduling and what we would prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if that's what it takes,
you have to meet people on their level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it comes down to really.
Agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, our government had patents on
cannabis years and years and years ago in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's time that we make change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's so many people that are on
board with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's so many advocates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just lost a good friend, Dave,
damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have his seeds available on
my website.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing some phenohunting
with his genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has something really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: His Blue 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you've had White Thorn
Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know the way White Thorn Rose
makes you feel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Blue 13 does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like, and I was talking to
someone at his memorial, his, what do they
[SPEAKER_03]: call it now?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a celebration of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we've changed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and it was a celebration of
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got to meet one of his friends and
she's a gongier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's probably the only person in the
whole world that's tried both of the Blue
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 and the White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we both looked at each other crazy
when we were like, they have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she kind of validated the fact
that I was thinking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I know I'm not crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she knows she's not crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we're like, well, we need to
research this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be doing some tests on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've already been doing tests on
the White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it comes down to a specific terpene
that's very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't think of the name of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll post it on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just makes you feel really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Dave, he was a huge advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great person.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be missed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of him every day still.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at his seeds and I'm like,
okay, how can we do justice to Dave with
[SPEAKER_03]: his seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do something special for his family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to sell his seeds on my
website and raise money for his kids and
[SPEAKER_03]: his older kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're still kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so beautiful that you can do that
and use the plant in the way that I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: he would have wanted, you know,
and keep his legacy alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was such a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we did the tribute episode and you
featured my clip, which I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, CannaCon was one of the
very first events I ever did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put his hand out to me and he
encouraged me even on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd watched my journey and he was always
just so positive and encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I really give him a lot of
credit for helping me to step into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, into this role that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to grow his seeds and to
smoke that because it sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to share it with everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he would have loved that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would have loved to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was just such a genuine person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I just I miss him a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because you go through
different phases of grief when somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I miss him more now for whatever
reason, I feel it more like when at first
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're processing the whole thing,
it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it's like after he's gone,
it's just grief is a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it triggers you in like
unexpected sort of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something will remind you of him
or something more visceral like smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could like send you back to that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's just it's interesting
how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that with my dad all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, little things that remind me of
him and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost my dog last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been almost a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that was the toughest thing I had
to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's that's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pets, pets should live forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't want them to outlive me,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like at least I got to give my
dog the life, the best life possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually my fiance, as you know,
grows hemp and he actually makes CBD dog
[SPEAKER_00]: treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doggy dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they help so many animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually just lost his dog,
Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was great, great gal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really hard for him to
continue with the dog treats because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: so emotional.
[SPEAKER_00]: They remind him so much of Lucy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, there's so many other
animals out there who could use this
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see how it works, you know,
with dogs who have joint pain and epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separation anxiety is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, we have to keep going in
her name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no matter how hard it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of work to be done for Dave,
for the people that have passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I mean, breeders,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many so many people that have
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really cool what you do,
you know, and that you really want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: their memory alive through the plant and
through the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really, really unique way
to honor someone, especially in this
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's our responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's one of the response.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, growing up, you have lots of
responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just another one is being a
steward to a plant and being part of a
[SPEAKER_03]: community that's so much bigger than
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I love about the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's absolutely, I mean,
the plant brings us together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're here together today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the beauty of this plant is like,
it can bring amazing people together that
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't normally associate with one
another.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this plant is so special and it brings
people together for good reasons for
[SPEAKER_03]: benefiting not only the community,
but benefiting the planet and other
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one of the things that
I really like about you, James,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we're very similar in that sort of
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't see an ounce of ego on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand that this is bigger than
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always felt that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just knowing what you want to do for
the people and the plant and like your
[SPEAKER_00]: passion, it's just so inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always just loved that energy
about you because I could always feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if you remember
this, but there was that MJ Biz where we
[SPEAKER_00]: were both at some party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was maybe at the MGM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you remember this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those listening, basically we were
sitting outside on this patio and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting some stuff in my bag and I
pulled out my Puff Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even have it turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the security guard who was standing
there saw it and bounced me from the
[SPEAKER_00]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do not pass go, do not collect $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked my ass right to the elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we don't tolerate that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went downstairs and I was by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, OK, now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you came down and you were like,
man, screw those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hang out with us for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just went and had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so nice of you to have my back
and just be like, no, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll with us for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow, James is such a nice
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks out for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're all part of a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're part of a special group,
part of the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's different cliques
within the groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them are egos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have a lot more ego than I do
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with age, that changes,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Age and experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, I mean, I just like having a
good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like my friends to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's just a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, living is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it certainly can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really easy to get dragged
down by everything that's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress just existing in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are joyful moments, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a blessing to have this life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should be celebrating it and living
life to its fullest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not everyone has that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about that with my dad all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he was in a wheelchair for the
last third of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to go out and take him to
concerts or something where he could just
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free for a couple of hours was just
so special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he still had blessings.
[SPEAKER_03]: He still had amazing things going on in
his life, even though, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: we all do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I reflect a lot on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything that's going on,
I meditate and I reflect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think about what's going on and what
went on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got to count our blessings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you never know how long you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you really have is the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much to be grateful for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to live in gratitude is just
difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trying to live in the moment,
it's easy to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that you bring that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've studied Buddhism quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes so much sense in a
practical sort of manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was at a Dharma talk one time,
maybe 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was younger, I was a lot more,
not aggressive, but angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of pain in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a really hard childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was resentful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a chip on my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was listening to the gentleman do
the Dharma talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was talking about when you wake up
in the morning and you go out and you face
[SPEAKER_00]: the world what emotion are you leading
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sadness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it joy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been facing the world with anger my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to just switch it up and
have an attitude of gratitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, my whole world
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that was maybe your
experience a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we go through trauma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go through so much growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from childhood and to becoming an
adult, much different than it is today,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's not all that different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changed, but it's not all that
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult no matter how you look at
it, whether it's today, whether it's our
[SPEAKER_03]: generation, our parents' generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all a difficult thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all experience trauma in one form
or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so moving beyond the trauma and being
able to recognize that it's trauma and not
[SPEAKER_03]: letting it affect you negatively,
that's something that it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm grateful that I can do that and I
can look at the world from a different
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those moments for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to switch the script now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to interview you now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This feels very familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those moments for you
when you really are like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: this makes everything worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what my calling is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those moments for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone on the show is like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk about cold plunging a lot,
but I think when I do cold plunging,
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes me relaxed and makes me feel
grateful for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have milestones in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been milestones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning our first cannabis cup in 2012 was
a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Publishing my book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduating from culinary school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I graduated top of my class out of a lot
of students.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these milestones, and I'm just
grateful for the little things though,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those are the big things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the little things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got up at 5.30 this morning and I got up
at, this morning it was 4.40, but I went
[SPEAKER_03]: to the gym.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the gym by 5.29.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sun was just coming up and it's like,
I want to try to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are non-negotiable deals that I
set with myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, I'm going to do this right
now and I'm going to change the way I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those things I can reflect on and be
super grateful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like eating good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows I post a lot of good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love not just the food and the way it
tastes and the differences with texture
[SPEAKER_03]: and the sweet and the sour and the savory
and the different flavors, just like
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis with the flavors, but I love the
social aspect of food and going out with
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends and hanging out and having a
good time and knowing that that experience
[SPEAKER_03]: is only going to happen once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we might have another experience
together, but it's not going to be that
[SPEAKER_03]: same experience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really cool that you recognize
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single meal and every time you can
break bread with your friends and family,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a blessing for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I definitely see a lot of great
food on your page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know where he is,
but I want some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I eat a lot of good food and I cook a lot
of good food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm like focused on, I'm going to,
for the, for the next couple of months,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really focusing on this facility,
but also cooking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have a kitchen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have the outdoor kitchen,
but it's all be cooking for people here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice, but also for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I enjoy cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't enjoy doing it for a living as
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy that I don't have to do that in some
ways, but there is some, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is something special about making
food and then giving it to somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, wow, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that must be really special and
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm curious though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing with weed though.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're like, this is my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that you give it to them and
they're like, Whoa, this is frigging
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'll do the socks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't get that very much with
either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, I think just the
reaction, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's like other people have
opinions on stuff and you at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the day, know what you've done and you
know, you can't worry about other people's
[SPEAKER_03]: opinions too much either.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you, the thing is,
is like, if you're just trying to please
[SPEAKER_03]: other people, that's not a great way to
live either.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really need to please yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the most important
thing is figuring out how to make yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the only way you can really
make other people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I've actually
been working really hard on because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: such a huge people pleaser that like it's
difficult because especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: journalism, like, Oh, well, I want to,
you know, do right by my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to amplify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to like this piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do whatever I can for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, you can't play favorites
either, you know, and you can't just do
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's journalism ethics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a fine line for me and not
overextending myself to an over promising
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes I get in my head,
I get anxious, like, Oh wait, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: do they actually want to hang out and talk
to me or do they just want me to write
[SPEAKER_00]: about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have that weird internal dialogue
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're, you're a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sweat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of good people in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think some are mostly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely more good than bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and when you surround yourself and
you with good people and you get what you
[SPEAKER_00]: put out in the universe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you must really recognize
that as well, because you emanate such joy
[SPEAKER_00]: and such passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bet you get a lot of that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever you put into something,
you get out of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like relationships are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's your favorite strain right
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I get, we're calling it strain
on the show, guys, because that's just
[SPEAKER_03]: what most people call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct or incorrect cultivar,
whatever you want to call variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strand.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't call it strand.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I don't know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that drives me nuts is
strand.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I hear people say strand,
I kind of cringe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strain, I just, it's so commonly accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cultivar, this cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying variety a lot lately,
but anyways, to your question,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been smoking a lot more high
CBD strains lately, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sapphire Sue from Moonmade Farm is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fiance grew this Sauer Jet Fuel high
CBD strain, which has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have been really enjoying this
Gouda from Snow Till.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not tried that, but you're the
second person that told me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's very cerebral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also grew a bunch of Super High Life
from Ed Rosenthal and Humboldt Seed
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been enjoying the Snow Dream
from a Golden State.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the Sapphire Sue, I just keep
going back to that because I can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it all throughout the day and it's
not overly heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the CBD is very balancing and I have
to give a big shout out to the CBD strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they don't get enough respect
in the market, especially with everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasis on high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both know that that's BS, but I mean,
that's, you know, it's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's not 30 plus percent, 40%,
it's like bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, like there's a lot of
really, really good hemp and or just high
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually judging the alternative
cannabinoids category for Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I specifically was like, please let me
judge this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to amplify the power of
these minor cannabinoids and show that
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be some fire CBD out there
because I don't think it gets enough
[SPEAKER_00]: respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and there is some super amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to be doing some amazing
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's just, I mean, that's one of my
big breeding goals is to bring a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor into the high CBD varieties,
the high ratio CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the CBG I think is super
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think CBG medically is super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: The effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people have never even
experienced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really popular in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, California is such a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other states where they've kind of
been forced into the minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they can't get high THC products and
they're just experimenting with other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's been really, really
interesting to see how in more prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: states, some of these minor cannabinoids
are more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the THCV?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been trying that out at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried it over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't found a THCV product that I
really liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the data and I love the concept of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the theory of THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like, you know, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it has a lot of potential,
you know, as a diet drug and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones I got, it just didn't give me
a great, great high in my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing that I would say was super
special.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't feel super wiry from it like some
people get.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been enjoying the THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kurt, my fiance, had grown some double
Durbin, which was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried some from I can't remember the
name of it now, but when I was judging the
[SPEAKER_00]: women's Kenna Awards, there was a high
THCV strain from some Sacramento producer
[SPEAKER_00]: that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also tried a THCV dab at a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was garden society,
I think, because they do their THCV gummy
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think they were R&Ding some oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried that at a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lately, dabs and I do not really get
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really do a hot dab anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get too anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did the THCV dab and I was focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to everybody at the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: No paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, maybe this is
something for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think with those type of things,
it's all about the right product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't had enough to say it's bad
or it's because it's not like everything
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read about it and everything I've
heard about is it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some CBD THCV dabs that are pure
THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it needs to be full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing where it's like
mostly THCV, just like how I like CBG or I
[SPEAKER_03]: like CBG with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing, CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like them blended.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they work really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a little salad moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried the pink boost goddess?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in my book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not tried the flower, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dale Hunt helped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tried it yet, but I'm looking
forward to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the fact that they've gone and
they're working on patents and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emerald Spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like the farm cut,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that some people are like,
oh, why would you buy larvae weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the idea of like it kind of
remaining intact like for more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the farm cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's funny because
Huckleberry Hill Farms gave me jars of
[SPEAKER_03]: their of their white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I try to share it with some of my
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, dude, this is boof.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, dude, you don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: They give me that bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, dude, you know,
it's it's funny because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we talked on my last podcast about how
Instagram is kind of ruined weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the perfect example.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like this stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also subjective because what
amazing is is subjective to the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that flower is super special and is
super good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does look like it's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still like outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like ugly weed, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about that with the Canada
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty six.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's the little stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, it's very, very dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tests slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's some very, very special
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets you laid out for being 17
percent because that awesome turp is so
[SPEAKER_00]: wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you 100 percent that the
market has shifted in a not great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't even know what good
cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I really want to know more about
the consumer 's psyche and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided that weed was good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always judge it when I'm at a thing
like Hall of Flowers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a package to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the crazier and brighter the
package is, the worse the weed is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the most basic package or like
the backpack weed and the Ziploc,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, that's going to be fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mason jar of the Ziploc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, ugly weed has its place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someday when we have a pre-roll brand
that's just focused on pre-rolls,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you don't get to see the weed,
people are going to love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I think when you can take
away that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why rosin is so great,
too, because rosin, really, it's like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: either good rosin or it's bad rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, people look at the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: People look at the rosin and they're like,
oh, that's not the right texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This or that colors off the colors off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not light enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, it's about the taste and the
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, you know,
obviously we eat with our eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The phone needs first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like at the end of the day,
it's all about flavor and effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, judging cannabis has been very
interesting when you're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance and what exactly are the
metrics like, oh, how many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes are intact?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the color?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the trim job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how can we rate cannabis on a
really objective scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the effect is difficult because
that's subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something that feels really
great for me, like that THC VDAB maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't work out well for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you think we need to evolve as
an industry to be able to set those
[SPEAKER_00]: standards like they maybe do in other
industries like wine or whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about consumer trust and time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you build your consumer trust for
having good products and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people buy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have someone try or buy the
product three times.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're your customer for life.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what they say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're finding out that with seed
sales over the last year, our website's
[SPEAKER_03]: been live for January of last year,
and the ones that have bought over three
[SPEAKER_03]: are the ones that keep buying for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you can get them to try your
product and like it three times,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really getting people to try your
product again, one time might not do it,
[SPEAKER_03]: two times might not do it, but that third
time you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so exposure, getting your brand out
there, but also having a consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: product, which is like, it's a lot more
difficult to do than people think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dispensary model that we have
right now, I mean, the infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_03]: the way we have it set up isn't designed
to store products long-term.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that needs to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need refrigeration of the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not even not full refrigeration,
but we need to have cooler temps that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're storing our flour at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people don't get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you may have an awesome product and
it may go to a dispensary and sit on a
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf for six months and somebody buys it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in LA where it's hot or it's in
the Valley, even worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the store gets a hundred degrees on
some days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your product's not going to be good after
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to fix those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have all of the, all of the
delivery vehicles should be refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the dispensaries should have some
form of cooler temp that they're storing
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff in, you know, and this is just my
opinion, but I feel like the fresher you
[SPEAKER_03]: can get the product, the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can't get it fresh,
you better have good storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think that's been a big
challenge in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why companies like Grove Bags
and Boveda are game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I love my Grove Bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love my turplocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, is like, I have so many
friends that were just like me that are
[SPEAKER_03]: like, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even had somebody here the other day
that was like basically calling BS and
[SPEAKER_03]: then he did the research and he texted me
this long text and was like, actually I
[SPEAKER_03]: take back everything I said, make sure you
don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, is the proof is in the
pudding with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, um, I've been against the cryo
cure model yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there's potential for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kay from Trichome Technologies,
one of my good friends, uh, he wrote an
[SPEAKER_03]: article on it and he's done, I think he
might even have a patent for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think there's really big potential
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just haven't seen anything that's not
astronaut ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a, some guys coming on the show in
a few episodes from now and we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cryo cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be testing it with flour
harvested from facilities and we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do the smoke test and we're going to do
the COA test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've heard, you know, you hear all
the good stuff and on paper it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: higher cannabinoids, higher terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so does that translate to a better
smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe not so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I try to keep an open mind with
everything because it's like technology
[SPEAKER_03]: evolves so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second you say no, you get corrected a
couple of years down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're, we're smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of science involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that are using and
there's, there's so many people working on
[SPEAKER_03]: it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the D scheduling or rescheduling,
sorry, uh, we're going to have even more
[SPEAKER_03]: people and more scientists working on
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to figure out how to do stuff
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always excited for everything,
but for the future, I'm super excited to
[SPEAKER_03]: see what happens with the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of people that are
scared about what's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm excited to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for what we don't know that we
don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we, what we are going to
discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really cool that you are
willing to see how the cryo here works
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're uncertain about it,
even if you're mildly skeptical,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have an open mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more than mild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more than mild.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't believe it, but that doesn't
mean that I'm right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I'm one of those people who I'm
okay with being wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay with making mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You run a business and you fail enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start being okay with that stuff and
then learning how to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know that my way isn't always the
right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's cool because I feel
like a lot of growers and breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: always like the best grower or breeder in
the room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's their way or the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hear that you are willing to make
mistakes and you're willing to be wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and just have an open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great way to live,
you know, just go through life with less
[SPEAKER_03]: of an ego, but like same thing with the
breeding book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I have a great breeding book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only breeding book out that's
current.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it's the, it has the
potential to be even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there's other people that
could have probably wrote a better book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's better breeders than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's smarter people in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I try to learn from them and I try to
improve myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that's all you can do at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're never going to be the
smartest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to be the fastest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to be the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many people we're talking about
7 billion people on this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best thing you can do is learn from
other people and do what you feel that you
[SPEAKER_03]: were meant to do on this earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think human beings struggle with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's hard because I feel like
let's say that you were wrong about
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you take it so
personally, like, oh, I'm less than,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not, it's just a learning
experience to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to approach my writing with that
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, please comment, please let me
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please let me know if there's anything I
can do better, or if there was a theory
[SPEAKER_00]: that I put in here that might be incorrect
or that I could have thought about it a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always invite that sort of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't take it personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I care less and less about what people
think and say about me the older I get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I, you know, it's just,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know your truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know my truth and I know who I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, the more you know who you are,
the easier that is too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely something that I've
been, I've been growing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's, it's difficult sometimes
because especially being so public facing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, you know, what this is like,
there's a lot of eyes on you and to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to what we were saying earlier,
it's a lot of pressure, but as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, deep down inside what your mission
is and where your heart is, that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: that really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to think what they want
to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say what they want to
say, but you know the truth and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really all that you can control on what
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting world we're living in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so where do you think it's going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, that's a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're talking about just the
cannabis world, it's a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of uncertainty because
not only do we have the rescheduling
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially happening, but then we have
the farm bill coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially they weren't really talking
about any of the intoxicating
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, any of the THCA sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden this amendment
came through in committee and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: turn the hemp world upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It totally could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if they, if they, if they go by with
what it says in that amendment,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it, it's going to screw the whole
hemp industry because what they're saying
[SPEAKER_03]: is that THCA is basically the same thing
as Delta 9 is what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: THCA, and it does so easily convert.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heat it up, it converts to Delta 9,
but by itself it be like, I eat THCA,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can eat a gram of THCA and it doesn't
get me high at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually makes me feel amazing,
but it doesn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no psychoactive effect to THCA by
itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it could totally, yeah,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could totally turn the hemp industry
upside down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think if they apply it to
edibles, but the whole thing where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I don't know how to control it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how they're going to
rewrite it to where like the stuff isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They legalized it on accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, but to correct it to where it
doesn't have a negative impact is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be really difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they not going to allow CBD in shops?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, I think it's too big of a
movement to slow down, but I think they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to try to figure out how to control
all the sales of this stuff that's taking
[SPEAKER_03]: away money from cannabis businesses in
states like California and New York and
[SPEAKER_03]: states that are impacted by the whole hemp
loophole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's been really interesting just to
see how it's become sort of a hemp versus
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw it in Minnesota when they were
trying to pass their legalization bill
[SPEAKER_00]: because the hemp products were popping and
they still are the Delta nine drinks and
[SPEAKER_00]: gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could buy them at the liquor
store and get them at the tap room where
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people in the hemp space were anxious,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were worried that if we had
dispensaries that their business would
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer and it's vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's interesting to see how it's
lobbyists for big cannabis groups coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know, in support of this hemp
amendment and the, the infighting when at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day, like I thought we were
all on the same team, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been kind of disappointing to
see the contentious nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally understand it from a business
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wonder if there's any sort of
way to level the playing field and just
[SPEAKER_00]: let the consumer decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to find out this year,
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, a lot of people don't even
know if the farm bill will pass,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because cannabis and hemp is
such a small, small part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other stuff up for debate
and an election year and such a
[SPEAKER_00]: contentious time in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, who even knows if the bill will
pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the rescheduling thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will that play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I feel it'll be more like
business as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really feel like it's going to
affect the day to day operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if they can get rid of 280E
and there's more cash flow, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would obviously rather see it
rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if it's going to have
this wild impact that some people theorize
[SPEAKER_00]: it will have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and the thing is, as of right now,
it is not rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a pathway to reschedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people are like, oh, it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not done.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff that has to happen
for it to even make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, taxing, the taxation of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it going to be taxed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think there's so many aspects
that need to be thoroughly discussed,
[SPEAKER_03]: thoroughly thought through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe now is the time where you
can send a letter to your government if
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to comment on the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people should have their voices
heard if they want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take part in the democratic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually covering Cali Roots
Festival down in Monterey last weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a profit brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke Scarmazzo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually sharing a booth with the
Equity Trade Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually helped us judge a,
I did a MacGyver bong contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the winners bong too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little Apple filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Luke's like, you know, I know a thing
or two about DIY.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pipe being in prison for 15 years,
but I was talking to a lot of consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, about the rescheduling
because we exist in such a vacuum in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always so curious about what consumers
think and what their understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them don't even really know what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones who do are definitely
confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's already a done deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that it's just less
restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think maybe it's legal, but the
consumers really have no idea about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on behind the curtain and what the
implications are in a lot of ways we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really interesting
because the consumers are the one that are
[SPEAKER_00]: driving this industry and they need to be
aware of what's happening so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have their voices heard and make an
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at this point, they're just
like, well, weed's weed and I'm just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to follow along with whatever I've been
doing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the sheeple.
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of people that they
don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have so many more important things in
their life or it just doesn't impact them
[SPEAKER_03]: at all because they're not real smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they smoke every once in a while,
it doesn't really impact their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many people that are just
uninformed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what awareness is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think I'm trying to
accomplish in my career is just to inform
[SPEAKER_00]: the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I get down, I try to remember my
mission and my assignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the assignment, which is to get
the information about the plant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the assignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can do that, if I can inform
people, I feel like I'll have done my
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, they can do what they
want with that information, but they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to have it and it needs to be accurate and
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very concerned about the mainstream
narrative around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that we're kind of in this
weird reefer madness 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day you see headlines of,
oh, teenagers sick from gummies or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis causes psychosis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All this fear mongering is continuing just
in a different sort of way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really want to combat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think that cannabis is for everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do I think that everyone can benefit
from some accurate information about the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people out there are just in every
direction and we're so divided.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So politically divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting though, to see how
bipartisan support for cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: increased, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Republicans get high, Democrats get
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everyone, everyone's just
getting high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, politicians are making money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: On both sides too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's just, it's one of those
things that's for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not be for you, but it is there for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is there for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, going back to the minor
cannabinoids, maybe there kind of is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for every person when you break
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, speaking of the future,
I think that's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because right now we're only
really talking about a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and a handful of terpenes,
but what are we going to discover and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate and see and like the strains that
will grow in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be different cannabinoids that
we don't even know about yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you go to the doctor and they give
you a custom cannabinoid profile that's
[SPEAKER_03]: designed for your specific receptors with
your ailments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's all kinds of potential for
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Abstracts, you follow them a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they do some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're pushing boundaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the direction they're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need more people doing that and
more people doing it publicly because
[SPEAKER_03]: there are private companies that are
totally doing a lot of similar research.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think just the general public
needs to be made aware of so many
[SPEAKER_03]: different aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond terpenes, they're talking about
flavorants, which I think is awesome,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we called thiols back in the day,
but now they've really started to define
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just a post from Max Montrose
and he was talking about Jack Herrera,
[SPEAKER_03]: why the pens don't taste like Jack Herrera
and why you don't have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: association to an extract that's added
terps as you do the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jack's changed too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to like Jack back in the day and I
don't like most of the Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think they have a phenotype
that's inferior.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people are growing stuff that's
not as good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Jack that I had was completely
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was similar, very limey, but I would
say it was way more complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a super amazing taste, better than
the one today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one today is okay, but it's not as
complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's on the bottom tier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas Jack back in the day, we'd pay $60
for an eighth of Jack back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was frigging light your head on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be ripped.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to smoke the little small joints
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be super high and share those
with 30 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three or four of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's a personal joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke the bigger ones now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's daytime weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love a Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go wrong with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something everybody likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to call it the original Z now,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not allowed to say- Or the strain
formerly known as Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Prince of Weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that interesting, the fact
that we have so many varieties named after
[SPEAKER_00]: other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, trademark infringement all over the
place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the sign of an immature
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think especially with cannabis,
because it was illegal, there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: trademark infringement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you go after?
[SPEAKER_03]: People just did whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted some Jedi strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going to call some, they're
violate Disney trademarks and get their
[SPEAKER_03]: Pikachu or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skywalker OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grape Hi-Chew, one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: That violates copyright infringement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even my buddy, he got in trouble with
Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond Bomb Extracts in, I think it was
2004.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got busted and he got in trouble from
Hershey's.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had, I believe it was like Coca-Cola
and violations like that, but he had some
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome sodas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was making some amazing,
amazing extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had five years in prison in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like they went after him for the IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't bad enough that he got busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went after him for his money then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a company called Tainted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys didn't do any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put it all on one guy, different
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get really sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to make the bang back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like hallucinogenic bang.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people talk about how like THC isn't
hallucinogenic, they never had the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that shit fucking would fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was like, you would be,
yeah, it was, it was very, it was almost a
[SPEAKER_03]: ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had, we, I remember going to this rave
called Freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it was on the 4th of July
and it was like in Oakley up on the hills
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was like sandy and grass and like
it wasn't like dirt, regular dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like dirt with sand in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had tents and then we drank this
bang and it was like, you might as well
[SPEAKER_03]: have done some acid or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never, I've never consumed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of stories about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saying that though makes me anxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, but so he used some stuff that was
like not to where my heart was
[SPEAKER_03]: palpitating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get the bad, the negative effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we sometimes with edibles,
people freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't freak out at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I freaked out from edibles before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an incident on an airplane one time
coming back from LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I, I ate like a, I don't even know
what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was some traditional market
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, it's going to be
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got on the plane and we were taxing
to take off and I started feeling really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot and like my heart started racing and I
felt kind of sick almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was anxious and the guy next to me,
he just thought I was anxious about the
[SPEAKER_00]: flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, ah, I started freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started feeling like I'm going to be
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started taking off and I'm like,
I'm going to be sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no sick bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as soon as we were kind of up and
it was almost like acceptable to stand up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ran to the back and it was just
like sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was paranoid the whole flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just such a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, why did I eat that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really always an advocate for knowing
your limits, you know, and the soul,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go slow, start, start low,
go slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole thing, because I really hate
the idea that people try cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is happening more often
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People try cannabis for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not well-informed and then they
end up having a bad time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get sick, you know, they're
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is, literally, you know,
and then they're going to tell their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and they'll never do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I have friends like that when
we were kids that they never smoked after
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I talk to them now sometimes,
but, uh, they got too high the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they never want to smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I'm a huge, huge advocate for
knowing your limits, for knowing what's
[SPEAKER_00]: right for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take one little hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait five, 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to eat a gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and a half milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get really concerned about what the bud
tenders are.
[SPEAKER_03]: The arm of the gummy bear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just start with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just start with the arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One little toe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Rogan had a comedy show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was in San Francisco when he
talked about that, about how the edibles
[SPEAKER_03]: are so strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need like the ear of the gummy
bear or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's, it's facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I really get concerned about
how the bud tenders are portraying the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and it's, it's not on them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they don't necessarily
always have the best training,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm wondering what you think about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what can we do on the retail
level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm trying as hard as I can with
articles and, you know, online,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what can we do to actually educate the
consumers so that they don't have a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't freak out on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give them CBD with their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but, but other than that,
I mean, honestly, I would say that you
[SPEAKER_03]: awareness and education.
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to know that like,
if you do too much, it's not one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things you just do as much as you can the
first time you need to really take it
[SPEAKER_03]: slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the more we share awareness about
it, the better it is for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in California, we do have like
super, super like low THC edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's super low, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that in, you know, it's,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five milligram dose and, or up to 10
milligrams per dose and only a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams per package.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 10 milligrams, that gets me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get high from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, but even five milligrams,
that's a great place to start for an
[SPEAKER_03]: edible for the average person.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people can go up to 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, we used to eat 500,
not even think twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, we literally tried to
put as much as we could in the brownies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally we had butter and we wanted
it the strongest butter possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it was somewhere between three and
500 milligrams of brownie and we would eat
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've often wondered about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the milligrams?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my homemade brownies and cookies,
you know, back in the day, I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: remember having some pretty intense times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to go to a hockey game one time
after eating one of my brownies and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to leave after the first period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't like this energy,
but yeah, it's, it's always a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a guessing game, but I would almost
push back on, on the five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that can be too much for a
first timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think two and a half honestly
is a great place to start for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: folks just because you don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why this show's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about awareness now I'm like
five and yours two and a half and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: probably right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think less is more, especially with
drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffee's a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying anything negative about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it has impact and starting in
a small place is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with micro dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like with micro dosing weed
where you don't even feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's positive benefits to that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with, with weed and a lot of
other substances is you can't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: work your way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's in there, you can't get it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gotta wait it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like maybe you can take a high,
high dose of CBD or actually my staff
[SPEAKER_00]: writer, Kara, she's working on a piece
right now, testing out all these products
[SPEAKER_00]: that promise to help you come down if you
get too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several things on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're just like a high CBD energy
shots, what kind of it looks like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the formulation, but I'm
really interested in hearing how they work
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those products are viable on the
market, because I don't really see them in
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anybody pushing these
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something that we should have for,
for harm reduction purposes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: available or maybe throw it in the,
in the outbag like a high CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 milligram capsule or something just in
case.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's because these are the things
that science is going to help formulate
[SPEAKER_03]: over time to how, what's the fastest
delivery mechanism that we can do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it taking a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it eating a pill that has, you know,
that's, that's basically has some form of
[SPEAKER_03]: fat or some something that'll basically
make it a lot easier to absorb faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sublingual.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many new ways of doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: New CBD patches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I find it really
interesting, all the different uses and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the different potential methods for
delivery that they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them are wild and some of them
are unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's always going to be the case
when you're doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I see stuff all the time that's
maybe not necessary, but it's like someone
[SPEAKER_03]: was creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have enough creative ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to come up with some really
cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as, you know, weed technology and
innovation, we're in a crazy R and D
[SPEAKER_00]: period over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've obviously seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when it comes to breeding
and growing all the technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on the consumer facing level,
whether it's, you know, devices or use
[SPEAKER_00]: cases, what are some of the things that
have stuck out to you is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, that actually is a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I love Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's been some genetics
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like there's two guitarists that
changed the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jimi Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond that, there's been other amazing
guitarists too, but those were the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the genetics were that
changed the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question because you
go all the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you think about the original
land race strains and how far they've
[SPEAKER_00]: come.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as genetic markers within our
timeline of the last like 10, 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously like Girl Scout Cookies
was huge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it felt like for an entire decade,
everything was some sort of dough turp,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the Skittles I think as
well, you know, that Z is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People continue to ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going back, I think, you know,
strains like Blue Dream for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Jack Herrera, the OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem 91, I think was the biggest game
changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Chem 91, it was the bag seed that
was found on the lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legendary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, really, I mean, there's more to that
story, but it was the meeting happened on
[SPEAKER_03]: the lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seeds came later, but because of the
Grateful Dead, really, really amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Game Changer to this, you know,
I think that's what got gas into
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when people started really
appreciating gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: OG Kush, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, if you look at the Philo studies
of OG Kush, they have 90 different things
[SPEAKER_03]: that aren't called OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're genetically identical to OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means people renamed it 90
different things, which means it was
[SPEAKER_03]: probably 500 different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So OG Kush is a game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream I think is a game changer too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a super important one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Herrera in its day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Super Silver back in the day
was a huge game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could go back even further with
like Hindu Kush and some of the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that brought the original Kush's,
you know, those were all game changers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the Master Kush and the Bubba Kush
and the OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were all in my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before that, there was, you know,
Afganica.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were bringing stuff back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-Soviet Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm really, I love hearing about what
weed they were smoking back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's dad is always talking about
Panama Red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember people talking about like
Thai stick when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to, I was an au pair in
Amsterdam and I had been hearing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai stick and the chocolate Thai when I
was really young and gray area,
[SPEAKER_00]: that coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: John from the gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in there and I was talking about
like, Oh, is there any place where I can
[SPEAKER_00]: get this type of weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Oh, you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're growing a chocolate Thai right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not ready yet, but it'll be here in
like March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was in maybe November or December
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay, I'm going to come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep my eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up leaving Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fired from my au pair job and I
never got to try their chocolate Thai at
[SPEAKER_00]: gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something I've always regretted
my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then I was smoking a lot of
silver haze, a lot of white widow,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all the white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see some of those strains make a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain do you want to see make a
comeback?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a trick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody who watches the show knows I
want cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is absolutely the one, the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that is a, I'm sure our producer has
been waiting for me to say cat piss on
[SPEAKER_03]: this episode, but I love, I want the cat
piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing the documentary on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep talking about the documentary,
but like we're going to be recreating the
[SPEAKER_03]: cat piss, uh, doing several crosses to get
something similar to what I remember as
[SPEAKER_03]: cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cat piss is also the description of an
aroma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's multiple cat pisses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's just one cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there could be potentially
several, and it's not like blue dream or
[SPEAKER_03]: Romulan or super silver haze where they're
a specific name and it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: describe the aroma or the smell of it,
where you call something piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could see how that could get
changed into several things over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think that is also very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in our community is the fact that you
have so much of that, where it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an OG Kush, but then they changed
the name or whatever and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those genetics continued and the
lack of consistency in the marketplace and
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't actually know for sure what
they're getting, what they think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumers are like, Oh, the package
says OG Kush, so it must be OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And totally it ruins weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the same thing where like
the first impression is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if, if you get a, for the first time
you get something that's called OG Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's garbage, you're like,
OG Kush sucks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like that happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of people are like,
Oh, this sucks or that sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of cut fishing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on top of all this, with the cut
fishing, then somebody gives you something
[SPEAKER_03]: like, this is OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's OG Kush and that happened
10 times over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's 10 people now that are giving
and sharing and crossing it and saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed this with OG Kush, but it's not
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really crossed with OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where the dilemma comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how do we solve this big problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're not talking enough about
how big of a problem it really is because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's happening all over all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it make you feel as a breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can look at stuff from the
outside and it doesn't piss me off as much
[SPEAKER_03]: as maybe it pisses off other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more of a solutions based person
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, okay, what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: Finger printing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go to My Flora DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can fingerprint all our genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we sell the cuts, we can
fingerprint them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can verify it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody calls it that, then we can go
look at My Flora.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can test their flower sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, okay, they got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they don't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dammit, that cut leaked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got out to the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think technology is going to solve
the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's so many people that are
just okay with changing the names
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that do bad things and
then there's facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so hopefully we can win the war with
facts and beat these people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bullies and there's bad people all
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess both of us are doing that in
our own individual way.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a writer, I'm trying to work for truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fake news out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the weed media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we approach it from a space of
just truth and wanting to do better as an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and wanting to level us up and
help us be more professional in the eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: of the mainstream American who's just
waiting for us to clown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many people who dog on us
because they know that at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, it's like, oh, you guys are just an
underground market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're doing out here
in the real world, but we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us strive to be professionals and
to be good stewards of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard when you see so much
infighting and shit talking when it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all on the same team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really frustrating.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I think so going back to
fingerprinting and why that's valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when you have a fingerprint of
something that you created or that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have in your hands, I think that that's
valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there's no negative side
to that because you proved that you had it
[SPEAKER_03]: at a certain point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a breeder with our collection,
being able to collect markers on
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, I think is so huge also for
breeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like part of what we do is data
collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a breeder, what you do is data
collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that a large part of what we
do that we don't even talk about is data
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more advanced we get, we're using
software now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all on little books.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's amazing that the potential
with AI in the future, too, is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: super incredible, especially predictive
modeling for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a game changer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that there's a lot of
excitement around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people scared of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, man, you got to embrace it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to happen no matter what.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's embrace it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's figure out how to make it work for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would have huge benefit for
the producers and just the supply chain in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people think that
breeding is just crossing this with this
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not what real breeding is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot to do with the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to do with selection and then
breeding over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And true breeding takes a lot of work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would assume so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this would take some of the
guesswork out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it increases the potential of what you
can do, which I think is the most amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's one thing to be breeding and
looking at a plant and going, OK,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, this one yields and we're going to
breed the one that yields the most with
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next time you select, OK,
in that progeny, we got these specific
[SPEAKER_03]: turf profiles and this is the big
producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can do that over and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: But using data to breed is going to be the
biggest game changer ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now, I mean, they've been doing a
big act for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now taking all that information and
applying it to cannabis, we got guys doing
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not even GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about just data driven
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say to the people who are
anxious?
[SPEAKER_00]: About the technology coming into the grow
who feel like it doesn't have a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you say to those people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that everybody has a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether you feel that it has a place
or not, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe your purpose is breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get on the bandwagon,
you want to still do it your classic way
[SPEAKER_03]: up in the hills and, you know,
go along with the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's slowly going away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like breeding is getting a lot more
scientific and people are taking to the
[SPEAKER_03]: next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So either you educate yourself or you get
left behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's kind of what my book
was about, at least to start that
[SPEAKER_03]: dialogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next version of the book is
going to have even more information on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the more I learn, the more is
going in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to share the information with the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can do what they want with it,
just like I said earlier with my writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have the information now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do with it what you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we can do is put it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the world likes it, the world likes
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they don't, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I mean, it's like and the
thing is, is with technology, I think it
[SPEAKER_03]: has the potential to make the world a
better place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, whether that happens or not,
that's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the potential is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to see Skynet in
the grow room or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, or Monsanto comes for all my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not corn seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis is becoming such a huge cash
crop, though, like I've been watching,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they always put out data like,
oh, now it's bigger than this and bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than that and bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that trend will continue or
do you think there'll be more market
[SPEAKER_00]: compression, especially if we go into an
interstate commerce situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like we're going to have our
ups and downs and there will be heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: consolidation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just look at Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Colorado is the best example.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at Colorado, the consolidation
that happened there is going to happen
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere, especially with interstate and
MSOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multistate operators are going to be
everywhere because people want to expand
[SPEAKER_03]: their brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also look forward to Humboldt
County, Trinity, Mendocino and Sonoma
[SPEAKER_03]: having designated areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: For terroir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to do the farm to table
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you can go up and you can meet the
grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a winery brewery hybrid that
you get to meet the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may be maybe there's a bed and
breakfast there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can stay in the bed and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could just go to the tasting room,
taste this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're harvesting, you can go walk
the fields and watch them harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that is a cool experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be boutique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be, you know, craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing wrong with craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always room for Budweiser and
there's plenty of room for Laganitas and
[SPEAKER_03]: Russian River and these small breweries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laganitas is now a big brewery.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like the hybrid too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were craft and they grew and they
grew and they grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're a multi-billion dollar
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they produce good beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the beauty of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody likes the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, everybody likes the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not everybody requires it or would be
willing to pay more money for the best of
[SPEAKER_03]: the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be opportunity for every type
of consumer to get what they need and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's right for me might not be right for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really love the idea of people being
able to connect with their grower if they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you can go to the farmer's
market and get your tomatoes or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get them at Walmart, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But consumers should be able to have a
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walmart has to have a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have Walmart groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying they're any good,
but they exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, it's like,
I think I just want to really see the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in the Emerald Triangle survive and
be able to weather the storm and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to invite those folks up, which a lot of
them are doing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know Johnny and Rose, they do stuff
at their farm and Soul Spirit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have glamping retreats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and it's a full experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to expand because that's the
evolution of the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that as being, and there's huge
consolidation that happened there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's way more brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was way more people doing it and it
became less and less and there's still
[SPEAKER_03]: guys doing it successfully, but it's going
to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to grow again because it's
meant to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there's plenty of places
in the United States that could grow good
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Californian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are some other places in the country
that you think have fireweed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington has good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back East.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get everywhere from Maine down to
Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good weed that can be found there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're growing good weed
in all these places, but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely doing some good stuff in
Florida now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we've got some guys,
plenty of guys from Colorado that decided
[SPEAKER_03]: to go to Florida, you know, and then same
thing, Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've got good stuff over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends over there that are doing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know I haven't seen their flower,
but I'm assuming that it's top,
[SPEAKER_03]: top, top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of my friends that used to,
you know, people aren't having to come
[SPEAKER_03]: here for flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're just producing it over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that they have crazy good weed
in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Maine and Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hearing amazing things about
their bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the bud in Massachusetts too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another deadhead community there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel like anywhere there was a
big deadhead community, there was like
[SPEAKER_03]: some good weed and the good weed being
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you think they, there's room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep it political.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but the funny thing is,
is like, we have seen tons of improvement
[SPEAKER_03]: here, but there's, it could always be
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think on the, on the rec side,
there is room for improvement everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not one place that has hit it out
of the park that's fucking, that I know
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has just knocked it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like we all have our problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington has their own problems and they
have fire weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the weed up in Washington,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends, my friends up there crush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all crush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you guys in Washington, crush it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon, there's so many good places in
Oregon, but then they gave out licenses to
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody and then they did this stuff
with botrytis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they didn't do it right either.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're no better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Arizona did really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, I think Arizona's model was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's good flower there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good flower or ceilings got some good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's other brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that have good stuff in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: New Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some friends in New Mexico that are
crushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, but as far as like room for
improvement everywhere, it's got to
[SPEAKER_03]: improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause California look at 2018,
when it first hit the market, it was
[SPEAKER_03]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rec weed was garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can actually find good stuff in
rec, but not as much as you should.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a lot of mediocre product,
uh, overpriced booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we can change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It better happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get on that in New York
because so far what I've been seeing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulated side there, it's like,
and it's expensive as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no wonder that people just want to go
to these illicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bodegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, not only are people confused
about what's real and what's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's legal, what's not, but if you can
get something for a quarter of the price
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's maybe even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, I just, I hope they can get
it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I really feel for the regulated
operators out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some good people who are really
trying to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just miles behind of what
these bodegas are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it sucks for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also be fair, feel like there's
always going to be room for the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional market too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm an advocate for the traditional
market because I do think that people
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to go to the other farmer's
market or wherever their craft place and
[SPEAKER_00]: get what they want and know their grower
and know their farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if you want to go to a regulated
dispensary, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it comes back to consumer choice
and just education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will assume the risk, whichever path I
take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did I get a strain from you?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could bring you back anything,
what would you bring back?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, thinking about that
white widow, I mean, you don't really see
[SPEAKER_00]: white widow around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the white widow I've seen in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one white widow in the nineties
that I think it was unrelated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there was some stuff out of
Florida, but like, I never liked white
[SPEAKER_03]: widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the vanilla weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stuff in Europe, it was like,
you cross it to anything and it vanilla
[SPEAKER_03]: fives.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean that I got the right or
wrong white widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably means I got the wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe there was really good white
widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had stuff called the white widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called it the sweat, but it was really
supposedly white widow, but it made you
[SPEAKER_03]: sweat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would get you so high and it had a
little nose burn to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slightly kind of hazy, but like that nose,
but when you'd smoke it, it would,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd burn and get you so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your eye, it'd be real tight eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we call it the sweat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally you'd start pouring in sweat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was the only time I got good
white widow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was overseas and we bought white
widow in Spain, Amsterdam, never saw
[SPEAKER_03]: anything good that was like real white
widow over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, I'm trying to remember where I
used to always shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this place called the Braxis or
I feel like they had, they had decent
[SPEAKER_00]: white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a strain that I smoked when I
was young called orange crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what the guy called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely remember orange crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had an affinity for orange turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's kind of changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like team elite genetics has
like an orange soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the most similar to that
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to see that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What turps do you think are making a
comeback right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think gas is making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, so we, we've been going back and
forth with gas and like the gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that floral candy gas,
purple, purple candy gas, what they call
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but really it's like the floral candy
gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the stuff leans heavy,
like the jokers leans heavy on the gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like that side of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like those are a lot,
a lot of times those are the stronger ones
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the stronger smoke, but I feel like
we're going back to more gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go back to citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Tangy is going to make a comeback
this next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of hate people on
this show in the comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me how you feel about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like there's a lot of hate on
Tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally, I mean, I think you get sick
of Tangy and then the world got sick of
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like this huge thing in 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the, it was the hot shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the hot, it was the hot,
hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I mean, Girl Scout Cookies was
popular here, OG, but like for high times
[SPEAKER_03]: and like that community, that was the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the most awarded thing every time
it won.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there was where people,
the judges would be like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: they know how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, how are you set before they even
started judging when they got to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangy, they were going to pick the Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely a standout and I know
it's contentious, but my fiance is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually growing a Tangy CBD strain for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super stoked about it,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to see more hazes too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing some haze work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's the Lord's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things, these, these plants take
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I got some Malawi versus Oaxacan
that a friend gave me for Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm super excited about those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They smell crazy and they're just super
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm like ready to jump on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think doing some work with that and then
crossing that back into something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for both of us in our own
different ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always new innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that people would ask
you to bring back that you wouldn't bring
[SPEAKER_00]: back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on a personal level, you're liking
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I never was into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never liked purple punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like it for the first time I saw
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one of the, it's Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple punch was the one where you're
like, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with some of the wedding cake
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is good wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no good purple punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple punch, maybe an extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get some okay tasting extract or
whatever, but as far as like rolling a
[SPEAKER_03]: joint of it, you would light it up and
instantly it would taste like nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you, you don't get turps in the
joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mild turps anyway, to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you smoke big joints of it,
like the first hit you might almost get a
[SPEAKER_03]: little turp and then it would just taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might as well smoke a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, there's a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not a big Oreos fan either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the smoke of Oreos, but I've sat on
my show a million times.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all one cross away from being
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the beauty of this stuff is like
you find something like purple punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cross it to stuff and make it
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does really well as a breeder Oreos
does well as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done some really interesting work
with Oreos, but as far as like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has like chocolatey mild turps that
aren't, aren't interesting at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's not interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like interesting turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind fried chicken turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, but I want interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I love finding those in the garden
where you squeeze it and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that's fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy, I was in Seattle not maybe two
years ago and we were going through and
[SPEAKER_03]: he's like, did you guys smell this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells just like fried chicken,
dead on fried chicken turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, I like a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think variety as far as flavor,
you, you get used to one thing and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to try something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing is, is like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times I enjoy Skittles so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, if I have 50 different things
and I get Skittles, I'll smoke all the
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles before I go back into everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's whatever the best is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue 13 is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like straight amazing blueberry
turps, green weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You like green?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have preference on green versus purple
or purple versus green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bright green girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shade on purple weed or dark green
weed, but there's something about bright
[SPEAKER_00]: green, especially with like that lime
green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's just, there's just
something about it and that almost looks
[SPEAKER_03]: fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it shouldn't actually be weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of the cryo cure ends up
looking like that, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it does, but is that more about
bag appeal for the cryo cure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's something there
with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sold on it at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe in it at all, but I'm
willing to like see if someone could
[SPEAKER_03]: change my mind because I think the science
of it, there's potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe people figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they won't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that we have to do this stuff
over and over and over to try to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff out, to see how we can improve the
plant, improve the processes of drying,
[SPEAKER_03]: curing, storing, you know, LED lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: LED lights are way more efficient than
HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, is now we have a
adjustable spectrum so we can mimic
[SPEAKER_03]: certain spectrums.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's great because we're
fucking up the environment using HPS
[SPEAKER_03]: lights at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not cost effective either.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're producing so many,
you know, if you want to do what's best
[SPEAKER_03]: for the planet, we'd just be growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think mixed lights the future too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely feel like mixed light doesn't
get enough credit in our space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they're doing a lot of
really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you think to compete,
your prices have to go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so your costs have to go down if you
want to make a profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to run the lowest cogs,
you're going to use mixed lights to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the best quality product that competes
with indoor, but costs a fraction of the
[SPEAKER_03]: price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it competes and maybe beats
indoor eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen some of the amazing mixed
light and I think it has the potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as a whole, it's going to just
get bigger and bigger and bigger because
[SPEAKER_03]: people are going to be more competitive,
especially for quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see how it all plays out
and get to write about it too.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people are interested in finding out
more about you, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow me on Instagram at
Rochelle, the writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit me up on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, LinkedIn's pop in for cannabis
and definitely check out GreenState.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the website that I'm the editor of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put out lots of amazing content and
we have a great newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out on Tuesdays at 420 and people
should sign up for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We promise we won't spam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you even wrote an article on
me on there at one point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still doing some work,
you know, with Beard Bros, MG,
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to get as many names in the mix
and amplify and all the different channels
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so many different
audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just encourage people to be in touch,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a story, if you have a story
that you'd like the world to hear,
[SPEAKER_00]: please get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My DMs are open and always happy to hear a
pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there are a lot of people
in our community that deserve to have
[SPEAKER_00]: their voices heard and they just don't
know necessarily how to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need necessarily a publicist.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shade on the publicist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everyone can afford that or know
how to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage people just share their
stories with me or with anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of amazing weed writers out
there who are just killing it and who want
[SPEAKER_00]: to share these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should really reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that movie Almost Famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry kind of reminds me
of the kid from Almost Famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have our squad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a blast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to doing it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll have to write an article in a
magazine about you next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always just a pleasure to see
you, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're such a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just a big fan of your energy
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
