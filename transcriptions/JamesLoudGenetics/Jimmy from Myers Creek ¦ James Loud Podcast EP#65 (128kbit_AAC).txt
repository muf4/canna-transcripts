[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today our special guest is Jimmy from
Myers Creek.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been excited ever since I talked to
Shane and kind of got part of your story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been excited to get you on the show
and it happened really fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for making that happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a lot to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been a steward of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a big part of Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're here to get that story today.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, that's the thing that excites me
the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's start off with how you got
involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom was dating a guy who grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wasn't a consumer of cannabis and he
always had a flower around the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he was an impressed mom or
something like that, but there was always
[SPEAKER_02]: like these, you know, large outdoor,
you know, you know, big baseball bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was a kid, I just clipped the
bottom off here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even smoke at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just, you know, we, we didn't
have, you know, lots of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew if I, if I sell this to the
stoners, I can get some money and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: buy a skateboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the motivation at 14,
15 years old wasn't until I was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a little bit older in my teenage
years where I actually started consuming
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, just natural progression,
you know, just went into, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: then, you know, next thing you know,
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're similar ages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were special times in the early
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I used to drive down to Santa
Cruz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've told the story on my podcast many
times, but I used to get the strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: bud from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing strawberry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was skunk, but it was strawberry shaped
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to drive for an eighth,
we would, you know, for $60 eighth,
[SPEAKER_03]: we would drive all the way to Santa Cruz,
which was over an hour away for an eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but we loved that weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny cause names didn't mean
what they mean now necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of times it was just the kill or
some crippler or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever the name was at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a, you know, back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Names weren't really, you know,
you had a few strains that were Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: lights, you know, the, just the old school
originals, but everything after that was
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of make up a name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the mid nineties, it was like,
just make up a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was up in Humboldt County and I was like
the young guy who was moving all the older
[SPEAKER_02]: guys stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, it's weed kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you got to give it a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just name it something and I can put a
price on it then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when all the names started
coming around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone just started naming stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when Mendo perps was like,
we got Mendo perps, but it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: probably like four different, uh,
different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, but it was from Mendocino and it
was purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we call it the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, that was definitely, you know,
we saw the Mendo perps around back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what were some of the other ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Snow cap, egg, corn, mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm even blue dream back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was, I was mainly known for,
for blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved a lot of blue dream back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was late nineties,
early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say 98, 99, two thousand
somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have multiple groups that I was working
with, you know, and each group had their
[SPEAKER_02]: own strain that they, you know,
they focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I'm a, you know, big chunk of that
came from some, some blue dream guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some mango guys and then snow cap
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just these other guys were like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's green bud kid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the capis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The capis was big back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the strains coming out of Eugene,
Oregon, we got a lot of genetics from
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the four way we got this snow,
not the snow cap, but there was the snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the Fairfax four way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairfax four way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had a four way out here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairfax four way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: These names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but they were some super fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trinity was a really big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Trinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the dog, but that was, you know,
and they gave it to us as D A W G even
[SPEAKER_03]: though chem dog is D O G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's how we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going up to Alder point out there
on Alder point road in Blocksburg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our friends, he had an uncle who
grew up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like 17, 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at high school, if you had green bud
back then in high school, you were the
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it was, didn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just seedless and it was just
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you super high and his name was
Richard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just ended up calling it Dickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dickweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Dickweed was like one of the first,
you know, first strains for me as a
[SPEAKER_02]: teenager that like, you know, kind of put
me and my group of friends kind of on the
[SPEAKER_02]: map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we were the only ones in our age
group at the time who had anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were still like brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of brick weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we saw a lot of brick weed,
you know, that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the BC started coming down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like 97, 98 ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and my friends, we were moving quite a
lot of that back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, weekly, like, we were talking
about this on the podcast the other day,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, the football size pounds were
like, you would have to have a scale to
[SPEAKER_03]: show people that it was actually a gram or
a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are like, that's a
quarter pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you compared it to outdoor,
it would be a quarter of the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we vacuum seal, but we would like
leave that little bit of air for that
[SPEAKER_02]: sponginess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that Canadian stuff come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just, dude, it was, it was like
the, from both ends, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexico and Canada, they were pushing the
shit to get it in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there was names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some of the names back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was champagne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Champagne was one of the main ones that I
remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Canadian ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Canadian one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know, so long ago,
I can't remember any of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I remember the juicy fridge specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Juicy and orange crush.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 97, 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when, you know, the cannabis cups
going on in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had friends who were, you know,
flying over there and bringing back seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: going to the cups, going to the cuffs and
saying, you guys, we do it better here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, they harvest theirs in six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's premature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this, it's that, it's we do it better
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no need for, you know,
to go other than the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never went, but every time a friend
went, Hey, bring me back this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the first stuff that I brought
back was a, well that I had was Sensi seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: G13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sensi had good, really good stuff back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that they don't have good stuff now,
but back in the day, that was the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, the ingredient ask
had good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people had good stuff too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Sensi had like the real Durbin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the real deal genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, Oh dude, you got the Sensi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Hindu Kush from them as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Flash was fucking amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Flash wasn't like, the Jack that
people know today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was pungent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would burn your nose and you don't see
a lot of that stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't seen Jack Flash in 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen, you know, even just Jack,
just straight Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen that in a long time either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, you know, there's same blue
dream, love and hate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like what people think of as Jack
Herrera is I feel like it's changed a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very linear now, but the Jack back in
the day that we saw as Jack Herrera was
[SPEAKER_03]: not linear.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was still limey, but it was
pretty, pungent and strong, really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And looked amazing in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had like this, there was lime green
and looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had, they were running Williams
Wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Willie Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Willie Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't have that bag appeal,
you know, our senses, our eyes first and
[SPEAKER_02]: then our smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would look at it and go,
and then you would open up and you go,
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's work with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Durbin was like that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sour sometimes, sour could be like
really fingery and grow Fox tails.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd still be freaking amazing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still, whenever, I mean, I rarely step
foot into a dispensary, but every once in
[SPEAKER_02]: a while I do just to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see it's just all,
you know, desserts, fruits, candies,
[SPEAKER_02]: purple gas, you know, and I'm always like,
where's the sour?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the chem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just, you know, you can't do,
you know, sour in production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've shown a company that you can
give them 5.6 runs a year, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to let you throw a 10 week into that
cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even access to the genetics is
really, really hard because I have yet to
[SPEAKER_03]: see really amazing sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone keeps talking about it,
but they keep on bringing me stuff that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not like the sour that I remember.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even Blue Dream, I see, I see good
Blue Dream, but I don't see like the Blue
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream that we had back in the day was the,
you know, people talk shit about Blue
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream now a lot because they don't know
what really good Blue Dream is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream was the apical of structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was the top as far as looks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grew sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grew at its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say pungent, but it was strong
blueberry nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, the, the pounds looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You open a pound of amazing Blue Dream,
you're like, fuck, that's some of the best
[SPEAKER_03]: looking stuff I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it doesn't smoke how you want it
to smoke or whatever, but that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: special in its own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just an easy grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all the beginning people who like
started growing with me and I taught them
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always gave them Blue Dream here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they thought they were champs until
they tried to grow OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, why is there all the PM
everywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to some real stuff now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot more challenging
genetics that don't yield as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a lot of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of stuff that doesn't
yield well, it's, it's shitty for 60 days
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you get to smoke and you're like,
oh yeah, this is why I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for a while there, I was working
with some guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was probably like 19 or 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they had a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the first time, you know,
we always talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hoarding, you know, people like not
letting the cut out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I worked with these group of guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just, I would move all of their
product for them, but the cut that they
[SPEAKER_02]: had, it was called Ganni, came from
Washington, Oregon, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys held onto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like, you know, like the most
holiest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even when I went into the veg,
like I wasn't allowed to go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: bedroom by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They escorted me everywhere I went because
they weren't going to let me slip a cut
[SPEAKER_02]: into my pocket and nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I worked with those guys for a little
while there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately they, they were some
older guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always the youngest guy wherever I
went.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there was some drug issues with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that kind of surfaced,
I was like, Whoa, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice knowing you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moved away from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just, you know, that natural
progression.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's the next move?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've, I've met all the distributors
that I know let's move to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time, you know, some of my friends,
you know, it was, it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: still pretty scary back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still happens now these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my friends were getting,
you know, hog tied and thrown in their
[SPEAKER_02]: bathtub, you know, and, and it started
getting closer to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, Whoa, they hit so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, they hit so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all my guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bounced up to Humboldt County and just
started there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went up there with a chunk of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't know a soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew one person from high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had moved up there to go to Humboldt
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my only connection to the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reached out to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm up here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she introduces me to her father-in-law
who just opened up the county to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically took a while to gain trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was the young new face in town
up there, you know, especially,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Fortuna and Ferndale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the areas that I was in small
town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone knows everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're the new guy and no
one's talking to you for quite a while
[SPEAKER_02]: until someone cosigns for you and says,
no, he's a good kid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, till they figure you out and see
that, you know, you're not just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, passing through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Humboldt from there, it was just
a, you know, you start growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: start moving stuff for people,
you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get to, you know, right there,
it was like, you know, 98, 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I definitely remember I had,
I got, you know, the GDP cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like early 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I remember early 99 is
cause we had that Y2K thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember Y2K.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Y2K, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of the world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: End of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The computers are going to reset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where, you know, that's,
that's about when it started and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: given to me as, as the perp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was just the Nepalese perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just, you know, I had
multiple grows myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had a, you know, network up
there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Older guys who were running large
operation diesel Janneys in the wood,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, back then when you had 150
lights, you know, back then that was big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now that's, you know,
that's a clone room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a mother room, you know,
really small nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, eight lighters back in the day,
that was like, you were doing something
[SPEAKER_03]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had an eight lighter, I mean,
you know, cause you know what,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were getting 42 up to 46 a pound back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the eight lighters, you know,
turned into fifties, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: growing up and meeting people along the
way, I met, you know, we had a John here
[SPEAKER_03]: from cutting edge and he was talking about
guys having a hundred lighters,
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 lighters, you know, 300 lighters back
in the day where they buried them
[SPEAKER_03]: underground and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never knew those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have access to those type of
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had eight lighters and some people had
multiple eight lighters and multiple 10
[SPEAKER_03]: lighters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my buddy had a 30 lighter in a
house where he gutted the house,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight lighters were normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight lighters, 10 lighters in a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't need to have a large operation
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to make money and how much money,
you know, the dollar was worth a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: back then too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're talking about a $4,500
pattern, really that's like a $10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: These days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he had a lot of buying power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was, you know, in my twenties
and making ridiculous amounts of money at
[SPEAKER_02]: a young age, you know, and it was a good
ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots of great stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were exciting times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of cowboys back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: High risk, high reward.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people went to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: People went to jail for a long time for
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were murdered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had friends and people I knew that were
murdered over the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always said, I was, you know,
I dealt with some pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: scary individuals down here in the Bay
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was the guys up in the woods who.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't mess around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, you, no one can hear you scream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they don't even got to bury you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they just throw you out in the
woods and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the animals will get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The animals will get you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mean to take it into a negative,
you know, tone here, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was out there back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you heard, you know,
now it's like, you know, the dispensary is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting kicked in and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sure, you know, we all
follow, you know, different people on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram to see what goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still amazes me that these people,
you know, with, with cameras and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that people are actually
kicking in grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Oakland is it's because the police
aren't doing anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's happening in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a free for all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a free for all because the response
time is so long that they know they can
[SPEAKER_03]: get away with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but 20 years ago, my buddy had a
warehouse in Oakland and I remember them
[SPEAKER_03]: drilling holes through the walls to watch
for when the fucking crop was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, and so that's been going on
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're just bold and they'll just
bust in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the dispensaries aren't like
they were in the beginning of rec either.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to Harbor side and it's like a,
a shadow of what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they don't have a bunch of
product because if they did, people would
[SPEAKER_03]: go steal it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to, you know, I haven't
been to a Harbor side in a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were, they were one of the people
who I distributed to back in the Oakster
[SPEAKER_02]: damn days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a purple heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't burglies patient group BPG at BPG
upstairs area before the location that
[SPEAKER_03]: they had now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but, but yeah, that was BPG back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was legit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sold clones.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So blue sky cafe, blue sky, SR 71.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old, you know, the Oakster damn days were,
were great days for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you would have like a blue dot
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally remember a blue dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, I never got that cut and I
always wanted that cut and blue dot was
[SPEAKER_03]: special.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was always the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You came with the blue dot on the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only get an eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just had a blue dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: On it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to wait in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on Wednesdays only.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy actually hit me up on,
on, on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get ahold of him for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you ahold of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have very vivid and very fond memories
of blue dot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Romulan too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven of nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shaman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a strain called the shaman that
my buddy is the one who actually bred the
[SPEAKER_03]: version that we all got to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took the shaman, crossed it with the
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that back crossed it to the shaman
and still called it the shaman,
[SPEAKER_03]: but really it was the shaman.
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way it was frigging amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the smoke was, we had a lot of good
stuff to smoke down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all unique flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now a lot of this stuff tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would say the majority of
stuff out there is like that purple candy
[SPEAKER_03]: gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even I'm breeding mostly purple
candy gas is kind of the direction I go in
[SPEAKER_03]: for 80%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got 20 that we're pushing in
other different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even when I was, I was doing,
you know, production back then during two
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 days, it was always like, you know,
90% production.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is what we're selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these three lights, that's my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the head stash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this stuff that, you know,
it was, it was just, wasn't commercially
[SPEAKER_02]: like the G 13 Ash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that, that one cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had no bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked terrible in a bag, but it stuck
to the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the nastiest, greasiest,
stinkiest, foulest stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I couldn't sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I just grew it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kept that for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was leafy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little leafy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, it's been so long, but I got me,
I can still see that, see that flower
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone had posted, you know, that Fino
from the G 13 hash plant line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one you found the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and he was like, he's like,
yeah, we know it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we've kept it for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good breeder too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that has good, well, that has good
breeder potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had the AFQ.
[SPEAKER_03]: The AFQ was the one that was fricking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the fruity AFQ.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was also a hash plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the first time when I saw AFQ
for the first time, it was the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: stood out as the frostiest thing I'd ever
seen up to that point in my life,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it almost looked fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, did he spray stuff on us?
[SPEAKER_03]: How could it be so frosty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and now we see that kind of
stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Oreos and the GMOs and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get six to seven percent washers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big heavy duty washers for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff that's just caked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've come a long ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't come as far as I think a lot of
people think we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had great stuff to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the nineties, there was amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it tasted amazing, looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the amount of diversity was
significantly more than it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it seems like everything's just
been cross, cross, cross, cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we just got a bunch of purple gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, where's those
original ones that got buried and lost?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm still getting some interesting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get red Congolese.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that every once in a while.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: White Thorn Rose, although it is purple
and kind of candy-ish, it's feel good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's a good one that's one
of my favorites for the last year since I
[SPEAKER_03]: tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And blue 13 is my buddy Dave's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another special one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coming back for effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like I went away and went to
flavor and going away from flavor now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think flavor is super important
because as a chef, as a person who gets
[SPEAKER_03]: excited about different flavors,
I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But effect and the way it makes you feel
is special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can breathe towards that and
get amazing flavor, all the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the high is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like mine was always flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to taste something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to taste something good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to taste something unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to taste the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like everything has just been
like, that tastes like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tastes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tastes like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just try to stick with those
original ones and try to find where they
[SPEAKER_02]: are and get them from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people aren't doing them just
because they don't hit those production
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the purple gas is going to get them X
amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they run this stuff, they're only
going to make this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their whole production is purple gas
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand as a business,
you have to provide what the market wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't force them like, no,
you're going to like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can if you have a lot of
marketing power.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and there's a small percentage of us
that get excited about things like
[SPEAKER_03]: melanate or gelinate or lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 50 different flavors right now that
I can smoke or try.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you brought some A triple plus
melanate right now, I'd probably smoke all
[SPEAKER_03]: that before I smoked them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that stuff gets me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing, lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think lemon turps are kind of like not
that hot right now, not that popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Citrus in general, orange, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: That lemon tree is gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a pungency to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love smoking that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if I had it, I would get burnt
out on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do get burnt out on flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles seems to be one that I can keep
going back to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But OG as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's good OG, I'll smoke that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: GDP, but let's touch on your history with
the GDP, where you got it and how it came
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so again, 99, early 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working with some older guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the young guy in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took me a while to crack that egg to get
these guys to open up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny stories like these guys
were roofers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was renting a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a farmhouse, big house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of rooms blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, man, the landlord's
going to have these roofers coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are going to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I got vents coming out,
windows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, we didn't have the siltration like
we have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we didn't have it back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going to shut the room off or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had three different rooms all staggered
at different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I knew these guys were going to be
on the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to know what was up,
see these windows sealed off and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, well, let's just don't
try to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just be OK, come on in, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just showed them there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, what is this kid
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, man, what did I just do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you gave them my number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's keep in touch or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some time goes by, they call me up like,
hey, we need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this thing going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not quite sure what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they take me out to do this redwood
forest grow in the middle of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to walk through this little valley
down into this trail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get up to these woods, you know,
into these woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, here's this, you know,
this her her lighter, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jenny running.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walk in and these guys truly had no
idea what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had they had like bag seed from
like, you know, the 80s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had germinated all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were I mean, stuff was eight feet
tall with like a quarter ounce on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't, you know, poker face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to, you know, shit all over
these guys is seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I was like,
I don't know what to say, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, cut it all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no, no, no, we're too far in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you're going to lose money on
this and you're going to waste a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I flipped their whole scene around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they GDP hadn't entered it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the guys who brought it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, hey, you know, this kid,
he gave us his cut, just said,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, should we give it a try?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah, give it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mothered it out, made a couple of trades
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran just two or three lights of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing about the GDP back then
or the perp or the Nepalese perp is it
[SPEAKER_02]: held itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't require any trellising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was literally held slow vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was just a football.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it always reminded me of the
mighty might that I grew back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: from Emory's Mark Emory's catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, I would call Mark up and he
would send down to anyone could call Mark
[SPEAKER_02]: back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to put his phone number right in
the magazine.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you call the guy and he's like,
it's Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, yeah, it's actually Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and you know, anyway, GDP had that
same type of structure that I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: from Mighty Mike just kind of held itself
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it produced the numbers that we
wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing living soil back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started growing,
the guys who taught me, the guys with the
[SPEAKER_02]: begani strain, they taught me hydroponic
when I was 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of thought, well,
that's how you grow cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow it hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hydroponic meaning ebb and flow,
ebb and flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ebb and flow with me with cubes back
then on slabs on on on tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slabs, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, on slabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was just an ebb and flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't even, you know, like drain to
waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you had a giant reservoir under
your table that would pump it up and then
[SPEAKER_02]: let it go back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, I mean, three part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three part GH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: PH and PH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it worked and it was OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always thought like, you know,
well, that's how you have to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I go up to Humboldt County with my
hydroponic gear and I'm doing all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took another guy coming over my
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what are you doing, kid?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on here with all these pumps
and these fans and like, just get all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put these and put some beds on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put down some two by 10, some 12,
two by 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Line it, fill it with some good soil,
spike it with a bunch of organics and make
[SPEAKER_02]: teas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, OK, did that for my first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the again, the taste,
the quality of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instant change in taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instant change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm never growing hydro ever
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it was living soil from that
day forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just started growing all the GDP
in living soil, which just gave it that
[SPEAKER_02]: tightness, that color, that terping
profile was just everyone knew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they saw and smelled it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then we ramped up production
on all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my eight light, you know,
eight, 10 light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another location.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had multiple locations as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, enough to where we were,
you know, producing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere from 15 to 20 pounds a week.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was and I had like 10 or 12
different dispensaries in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Berkeley Patients Group,
Harborside, third floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third floor is who named GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story behind the naming of GDP is
again, we had strains, Lavender,
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purples were really huge back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a variety of stuff on the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would walk into the third floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was compassionate caregivers across
from the Fox Theater, downtown Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had up on the board, you know,
Lavender, Purple Urkel, Purple One,
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Two, Purple Three, Purple Four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it because there was no
names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I brought it in,
it just it sold out instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sold, gone, gone, gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as usual, I call the guy,
hey, I'm on my way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go in, drop off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, we're not we got to give you a
new name.
[SPEAKER_02]: This this purple one, two or three,
it's just because yours is the best here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours is like the granddaddy of all
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to call it Granddaddy
Purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, again, with the names,
I was like, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to call GDP, call Granddaddy
Purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pay me my forty two a unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys have fun with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they named it Granddaddy Purple,
put it on the board as Granddaddy Purple,
[SPEAKER_02]: sold out just as quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from then on, every other
dispenser that I went to and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: Granddaddy Purple, because back then,
CCG, the third floor was the dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: above Harborside, even at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Harborside was like,
you know, you know, second, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: second place to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like the most clones,
the most the most of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the guy who owned CCG at the
time, Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he was from the rumor was he was a
Canadian book, Alaskan bookie who came
[SPEAKER_02]: down here and he wanted to be the
McDonald's of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just quickly trying to open up
places all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing money at it, throwing money at
it, just hoping something sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did stick for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Larry had cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up passing away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legal problems came about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that the manager of the
place, Sharkey, he ended up like doing
[SPEAKER_02]: some time, I think, because all of this
mess kind of got left on him.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: CCG, like, you know, it was like it was
like I was like Norm walking into Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone knew as soon as I was
that feeling there for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to go and it was a it was the
badge of honor to get your card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Dr. Frank Lucido and got my card
in the 90s, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then afterwards, you would go to the
third floor and you would fill out the
[SPEAKER_03]: paperwork and they would call and verify
and then you would get your card.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a big deal back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they had the card presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The card press and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big deal to have a card from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lower the number, you could tell what
number of members because they did it in
[SPEAKER_03]: order.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were in the early hundreds like
that, that meant you were you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my mom was one of the original,
you know, Mecaria patients, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was, you know, he was one of the
originals.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, you know, putting those out there,
you know, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always get my card just
because, you know, I was a vendor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there was a dispensary in
San Lorenzo off of Sparian.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always just had my, every year they
would just have my script for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would show up to drop off,
you know, product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's your script for the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sign here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting because it was a big
scam and you'd have to pay more money if
[SPEAKER_03]: you wanted to get the 199 plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could get the regular, which I
think was 10 plants, or you could pay
[SPEAKER_03]: extra money to get the 99 federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the difference of like 200 or
350 dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the guys up North.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would just, you know, stack scripts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would pay you for your scripts so
they can just have another 99,
[SPEAKER_02]: another 99.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, have a stack that just a
stack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we did that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would put them on the doors of the
grows.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but we were stupid because we
wouldn't, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we all got busted at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We fucked, but like we all used our
scripts together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd have a whole door covered with
everybody's skip, but we all had all our
[SPEAKER_03]: grows had all the scripts on all the
doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so doubled up, doubled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times, but it was way more illegal
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you could go to prison for a
lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I always liked to,
you know, say I'm a pre 97 grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I was growing back in the
day where if you got caught, like you were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I was doing at the time,
like my first offense was going to be 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then when Lee, when the two
15 came around, it was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: here's a little, a little cushion,
a little buffer, you know, but still,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of the numbers I was playing
with, it was like, yeah, they're still
[SPEAKER_02]: going to want to, they're still going to
talk to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's federal, then you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even state, uh, you know,
I had a friend, my friend Josh,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's going to be on the podcast soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh Freeman and silverback grow Willa.
[SPEAKER_03]: He created grow Willa nutrients,
but like he got robbed by the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they pulled them over and they'd been
following him and they took his,
[SPEAKER_03]: he, they took his money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened a lot back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't get arrested, didn't get a jail,
but they took his money.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the coolest ones I, you know,
dealing with the cops, I got pulled over,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming down, you know, driving the
gauntlet 101.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're from, from, from Ukiah
until you hit the Bay area, you're just a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just a sheep waiting for the wolves
to get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, once you're in San Milimo,
like you're probably okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I was like, okay, 75 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Hopland, when you're going through
Hopland, there's cops, there's still cops
[SPEAKER_03]: to this day that are, that are parked out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just profile people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say they're not profiling,
but they're a hundred percent profiling
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, once you make it past Hopland,
you're a little safer than once you make
[SPEAKER_03]: it into the Santa Rosa, like you're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're safe now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in the mix, you know, and I was
driving down and I always did my runs
[SPEAKER_02]: first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just a worker on my way to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just put on the flannel,
fit the, you know, fit the profile or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some reason this time I had to
come down late in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun was going down, had to turn the
headlights on driving, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going along and all of a sudden,
boom, red and white.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a box in the back and a cop
comes up and how you doing, sir?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, I pulled you over and
no idea, sir, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your lights are out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, yeah, you probably blew a fuse or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you get behind me or you get in
front of me, I'm going to escort you all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to the truck stop in Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a fuse and you're
going to pop that fuse in and you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to go about your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I can't believe the CHP
just, you know, escorted me and my box,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to Ukiah for, you know,
that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought, you know, many times,
you know, there's another time I was in
[SPEAKER_02]: Willets and I'm going through Willets and
this, this high school girl pulls out in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time I was, uh, I had a
imported hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had freedom for Afghanistan,
Northern Alliance hash on me, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a half a block or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Federal, you know, instant federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she hits me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always knew like, if I get busted,
it's not going to be because of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be some outside force that I
can't control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This girl plows into me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, I don't know how much money on
me in this block of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any flour on me at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was probably good because you
couldn't smell anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing, you know, I'm like,
just playing it cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was just in an accident and you
didn't just hit a car that had a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money and, and hashing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking the guy, well, what do I,
you know, my car was, I couldn't get out
[SPEAKER_02]: of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, well, you got to call your own
tow people and da da da.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking to this guy and I'm like,
please don't ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, look at my car or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's over, you know, and I was,
all right, thank you officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went about my way with my car was
all messed up, but I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: just get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so back to GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, GDP, um, bring it to third floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I continue to keep, uh,
keep distributing to all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there's 10 to 12 clubs at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it grew in popularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when it was the third floor
and it was popular there and it just kept
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and growing and growing PCC
collective off of Berkeley off Telegraph
[SPEAKER_03]: had some killer back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Eric and Dave, there were the original
owners.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm still mad at those guys,
but over some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over some promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise you all buy five pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I brought it in and they're
like, sorry, we can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is kind of when, when, uh,
you know, things started turning really
[SPEAKER_02]: business, you know, a lot of these,
all of a sudden these dispensaries wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: me to start filling out paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, no, no, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then, uh, Harbor side
started with consignment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted two week consignment,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for everybody, but for, for a lot of
people to meet too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was kind of special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, I get cashed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can do consignment with other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is just standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, so that, when all the clubs
started to realize that they had the
[SPEAKER_02]: power, they didn't have to cash you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, you know, I was pushing to,
you know, to guys, my guys on the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was fun to them at way less than
what I was getting cashed out for at a
[SPEAKER_02]: club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all my street guys, sorry guys,
these clubs are cashing me out like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, uh, and then when they
started realizing like, Oh, we don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to cash these guys out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there was just so many people all of
a sudden the consignment thing started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I was like, that's when I
was done with, you know, Berkeley patients
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was done with, you know,
and then CCG third floor, they had moved
[SPEAKER_02]: down the streets and new people had opened
it up and it was kind of sketchy and Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want you to put your name and all this
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then, and then, and that's
when I kind of stepped away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, you know, that was 2005,
2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by then, by, by, by about 2003,
OG came around to the Bay area and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just what killed GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost felt like overnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say that overnight it went,
so there was like purple Cadillac,
[SPEAKER_03]: GDP, purple oracle, lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they were hot, they were hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then almost overnight, the only place
that would buy them would maybe be
[SPEAKER_03]: Richmond.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could pull it off in Richmond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Richmond was still buying a lot of GDP,
but like they weren't at any of the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wanted them anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like overnight it was gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: The price started dropping quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to grow the GDP in octagons.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason we did that was because it was
a slow veggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I don't like growing GDP is for
me, it was a 31 day veggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would hate nitrogen and it hates
nitrogen, but it would stay short.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really good for octagons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy figured this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he told me, and I was like,
fuck, son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get these huge yields in these
octagons because you're growing vertical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so under each plant, there's 26 lights
or 26 plants under each light.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was a four stacks, four tiers,
and they're all growing towards it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you grow a chem dog, you get a
wall of larv.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you grow GDP and it's like,
you get perfect buds and they're huge buds
[SPEAKER_03]: and you could flip it after a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get this amazing,
this amazing yield and you get over five
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was over two and a half pounds with
GDP in the octagon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made the mistake a few times of running
a train wreck in the same room with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Train wreck can't hold itself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a freaking nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like spaghetti's eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, one day I walked in and
even the trellising that I had just had
[SPEAKER_02]: everything had fallen over onto the GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't grow train wreck and GDP in the same
beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a lot of train wreck grown and
yeah, it always looks like it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: die.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even when it's healthy,
it grows in clusters, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Golf balls growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it doesn't look quite like it's
super healthy, even though it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though when it's healthy and it comes
out amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another one like Jack and train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really see anymore, but back in
the day that train wreck was super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason they call it a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy in Santa Cruz who still has
that original cut and he's, he he's based
[SPEAKER_02]: his company off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done quite well with it and he holds
it tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done everything I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was bred by Tyson Tyson.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the original breeder of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to GDP, where do you think,
what's the origin of GDP that you know of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's always been that story
going around about Chris on Salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I knew people out on Salmon
Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost moved out to Salmon Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had grown Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had grown Purple Urkel and there was no
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way that it's related to
Purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Purple Urkel maybe, Grape Ape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're two totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they have a little bit of
purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grape Ape has a little bit of purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: GDP would black out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like magenta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the deeper you went in, the darker it
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like Grape Ape too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew Grape Ape back in the day and I
really liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a big producer and it would
grow these huge buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as genetically, I don't think
that they were related.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've had people, I've had people,
friends of mine that are like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, they're definitely like sisters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I don't think that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I could see the origin of Purple Urkel
being maybe bred into GDP as like one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to me that was more possible than
the Grape Ape theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet I'm still curious and maybe it was a,
you know, it was a bag seed or a land
[SPEAKER_03]: race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nepalese land race.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it came to me as the Nepalese perp
or the perp, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just brought it down to the clubs
as the perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was probably, you know,
perp number one, two or three or four,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it was that week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until they were like,
we need to make yours stand out because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than all the other purples we got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they slapped a name on it and here we
are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we've had guests talk about it
being their, their strain that made them
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made the success they're at now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a Lee Starmazzo and his dispensary
was all about the GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_03]: All about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still loves talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's changed people's lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those strains that has
impact as much as I feel like GDP has as
[SPEAKER_03]: much impact as any of the other big
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's Blue Dream or OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could argue which ones were more
popular or whatever, but like it had just
[SPEAKER_03]: as much impact because when it was hot,
it was extremely hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the one to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't get it unless you knew the
right people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and if it was at the dispensary,
it would sell out before you get it.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you could look online for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I'm not sure if it was Harbor
side or BPG, but you could look online at
[SPEAKER_03]: their menu and you could look online.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is back when the internet isn't what
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, you could look online and you'd be
like, oh, here's the menu.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go down and try to buy it,
whether it was clones or genet,
[SPEAKER_03]: clones or flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, sometimes it would be sold out
before you'd even get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be looking at it before they open and
then try to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's- Wait in line.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a wait in line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, BPG was an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So BPG, there was like the chairs for all
the vendors and that's where I met people
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vendor area, the smoking lounge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big glass front.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's been so, yeah,
it's good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really liked BPG back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I haven't been to BPG in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been 15, 18 years, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to go visit ATN.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's still over at BPG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped with the dispensary a long time
ago, 2005, 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I let the cut out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying I'm the only one who had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you sell clones of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't give a clone out to anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had people offering me 10 racks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, I'm going to hold onto
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize how important it was
until I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got this little buzz around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was E-40 and Keek the Sneak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keek the Sneak started rapping about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, oh, wow, this is something
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also right about that time when
the OG came into town and pretty much all
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sudden the price started dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realized, well, no one really
cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even my network of people, they were like,
no, we're not, no, no, because we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: this much for the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not doing the Purple anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're transferring everything over to this
OG Kush cut now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a point where you couldn't sell
Purple to save your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream was like that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Blue Dream was hot, it was really
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was so easy to grow and the cut got
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody grew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody and their mothers grew it
because it would yield so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden it's completely
flooded on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going over to PCC off of Telegraph
around Christmas time expecting to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: stack of cash so I can buy Christmas
presents and pay my bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, sorry, we can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what do you mean you can't
buy it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They take me in the back and they're like,
dude, you wanted 32.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what we got for 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pull up and it wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the level that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were growing in soil back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Blue Dream just looks amazing in the
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another one that looks amazing in the
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first one where it was like
purple, you open the bag, it's loud,
[SPEAKER_03]: it hits you in the face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it's done right,
it's super amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my whole thing, again, I focused on
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't trying to pump it to get more
THC, to get more volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I want it flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was adding, back then I had run
trials of rooms with, and I was an Earth
[SPEAKER_02]: Juice guy back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the catalyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a wheat brand molasses
finisher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had side by side rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to flush this room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to run this room with the
catalyst.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to run this room without the
catalyst and these other little additives
[SPEAKER_02]: that I would put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do blind taste tests with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste this one, taste this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me which one's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: AB testing is the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was always the one that had that
extra oomph that I felt brought that taste
[SPEAKER_02]: and smell profile out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever use dark energy or liquid
karma?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two were like, I mean, they're
nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you just, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you were growing in the late 90s,
those were the secrets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, good karma and dark
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark energy is now banned in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Seek Help.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bad product, but yeah,
it's a PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a naturally occurring PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, banned in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people were using that as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people still this day,
you know, seaweed as a foliar PGR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That dark energy was special.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, when we started using that,
we're like, we're on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring that up, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just made the weed louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, it smelled louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we used to monocrop too a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'd be like, we'd only grow one thing
at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you were growing that over and
over, it's like the next time you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that so much better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived, you know, right near McClendon
mountain soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in Humboldt when I was up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would have them do special blends
for me, you know, cause that was
[SPEAKER_02]: practically their neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they did big runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're long gone now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a water, a water company that
didn't, you know, all of a sudden like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's start making the soil for all
these guys around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, yeah, we would put,
you know, dark energy into it and spike it
[SPEAKER_02]: with some guano.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, all the different,
we'd go down to spare time organics and
[SPEAKER_02]: willets and just load up the truck with,
you know, four or $500, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, dollars worth of organics,
take it back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that was back then,
you know, I wasn't doing, it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was, even though it was like soil,
living soil, it was one and done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now the living soil beds that I
didn't know, I leave that soil there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep feeding that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to get rid of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would start over every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I met like an
ergonomist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who explained like, no, you don't have to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're wasting so much money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and even then, like I was,
you know, Oh, the soil gets better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd be like, you need 72 grams of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 54 grams of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, it's not doing anything bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just wasteful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're just wasting a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only need a little bit of that and a
little bit of that, not the whole bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just, I stuck with the,
the living soil thing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to tease, we got a vortex brewer at
one point, but I used to do tease in five
[SPEAKER_03]: gallon bucks with pantyhose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old hum tea recipe for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to go to the thrift stores and I
would raid the pantyhoe drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people look at me funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, no, I'm making tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to weirdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pack that thing full of earthworm
casting, guano and all kinds of stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: shake it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it bubbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it brew for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the vortex brewers were a game
changer where you could do the,
[SPEAKER_03]: they made them in five and I think 10
gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably had bigger ones,
but we used to go to Berkeley indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: gardens and that's what they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Berkeley indoor grow indoor gardens was
like the spot Patrick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a lot of people use that place and
have fond memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to use the language.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all code.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, they wouldn't talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would sell you avid in a little vial
for 20 bucks under the counter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm a pesticide safety guy
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a license with the state as an
applicator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm, yeah, I do pesticide safety
training.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look back at some of the practices
from 20 years ago and I just go,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, just knowing what I know now,
like applying avid with flip flops on and
[SPEAKER_02]: she shorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was so many things like,
well, in first it was just pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: avid that people started using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was like, I don't remember the
trifecta, but there was like the three
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would use because they would get,
immune to what the one it's used avid judo
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all just systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gnarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we'll pass testing now if you're
them, you know, I know guys that will
[SPEAKER_02]: still use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they're just trying to hold
onto something, it's not in production,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's never going to be, it's never going
to see the public public's never going to
[SPEAKER_02]: see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a mother of a, of a genetic
that they don't want to die, that they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to die, but they don't want to
have to maintain it and baby it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be wrong, but I believe avid is a
trans laminate and not system.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually coats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the next generation or generations
after that, it's, it's not bad in that
[SPEAKER_03]: sense, but it would be bad to smoke
anything that had any sort of avid on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, it makes me cringe a little
bit that people have to use that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's, it's, it's literally,
again, it's a, and it's out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've sent it in it's clean
after six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just one of those things we don't
want to dump a bunch of maintenance on
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant on these groups right here of
mothers.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a, you know, friends who
run nurseries and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them has like a very large library.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they, they, they hold a lot of
my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hold a lot of breeder stuff and some
of those, you know, those, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle cushions, some of those original
with AFGOO, super silver haze and they
[SPEAKER_02]: hold onto those for, for guys like me,
like I can call them up and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I need this, this, and this,
and this, if you can get it to me in a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of months, I'm working with a new
male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, we got tissue culture for that
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's such a game changer for
banking genetics and having a large
[SPEAKER_03]: library of clean as far as, especially the
clean side of it, because it's before it
[SPEAKER_03]: used to take 30 lights, you know,
and now we can do it with racks and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, little dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take away all that space and just put it
onto one shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big time game changer in that sense,
especially the clean aspect of it is that
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember we had genetics that were
really good and we ran it for a while and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden they weren't performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were like, no, we got to get rid
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we must've cloned it too many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we've got a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've, we've out cloned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many clonal generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, and I would keep mothers for
gosh ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just the same plant you can clones
off for two, three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just, you know, occasionally I
would pull it out of the bag, hack off
[SPEAKER_02]: half the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, hack off, you know, three
quarters of the foliage, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the upper and then hack that down,
put it back into fresh soil and let it
[SPEAKER_02]: reach your enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would keep mothers forever to the point
where I was like, I probably should switch
[SPEAKER_02]: these out every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but you're, you're, you're
working with, you know, space restraints,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, back then, especially,
you know, we were just in houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I thought, I honestly thought when I
was younger that the more times you clone
[SPEAKER_03]: it, the worse the genetics get that it's,
it does something bad to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was something we all thought back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all thought that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that was pretty common
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we didn't know what we were
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just, there was no book for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had Ed, Ed Rosenthal and Jorge and a
couple of guys writing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like a three, you know,
and I ran all those books when I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: teenager and in my early twenties and all
I had all caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until I started reading Rodel
organics where like it all just dropped
[SPEAKER_02]: into place for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of the cannabis growing
books just seemed confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I think there was something that
you wanted to have a novel approach to
[SPEAKER_03]: back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think these guys were scratching the
surface of it and they had a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that was right, but there was also stuff
on, you know, I'm not saying cinnamon is
[SPEAKER_03]: bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cinnamon has its place with IPM,
but like cinnamon for this or that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would try and be like,
this doesn't work, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not like they say it does in the
book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but the, the concepts, I think
overall the concepts were good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that they were, I mean,
I just were a reading book.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I, I don't want to hate on
anybody that's ever put the time and
[SPEAKER_03]: effort to write a book because it's so
much work and so much energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like these guys, especially,
you know, Rob Clark in 1980 with marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: botany and then Mel Frank, uh,
we've got even, even, uh, Ed and Jorge and
[SPEAKER_03]: then Kenny Morrow and all these guys tried
to write the best book they possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's all about, I mean,
it's almost like art, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're writing this thing and you do
the best job you can, and then you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: put it out to the world and see how the
world accepts it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've come so far since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to, you know, Oh,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then it was, it was better than
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was better than nothing, but it was
hard to find those books.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you can just get them
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Telegraph Avenue, they used to have a
street fair and you could always get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a table with cannabis books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, always.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mushroom, cannabis, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had all the cannabis stickers you could
buy back then had them on my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a dude that made seashell pipes
with resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like resin seashell pipes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though it had a magnifying glass
one where you get was a bong that
[SPEAKER_03]: seashells and that guy must've passed
very, uh, you know, on Telegraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I think I would love if somebody
knew how to get a seashell pipe to get
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't have any of the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a big collection of pipes,
but I never saved any of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have an original proto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those original proto pipes are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the proto pipe was a great concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have my proto pipe from back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting in the drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look back at like, wow, we used to smoke
out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the original vaporizers that have
the element and where you have a tube and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like hand blown glass tube in a box
and then you put it on the, you vaporize
[SPEAKER_02]: before the volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when the volcano came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, Whoa, this is new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just couldn't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would show up to a friend's house and
he'd have jars like this of just tap out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to me it was like, wait a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, you're just melting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just didn't, it didn't make sense to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, no, I'm burning my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm burning my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just wasting a bunch of weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we take his jars and make
brownies with it, he always made sure,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to throw it out, but we used to
have big frigging long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we, especially cause we trimmed a
lot, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause everybody, there was a time where
all my friends, not all my friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: but my friends that grew, uh, we all
needed trimming then and we all harvested
[SPEAKER_03]: at different times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'd be like, you go trim for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times we didn't pay anybody to
trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would trim your friend's stuff and
we'd hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were watching in living color DVDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had the big, the big, he used the
volcano so much that we melted the fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: top to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally, but we'd get the big bags
and then someone got smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, you can't use multiple
flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each flavor has to have its own bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause then it tasted like that string.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you had one bag for each flavor
and we didn't add, I mean, we had
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was different stuff, but I grew this
and my buddy grew this and my other buddy
[SPEAKER_03]: drew this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had like a handful of stuff that
we knew was top notch that we really want
[SPEAKER_03]: to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there was the work weed and then
there was like the shit that we like
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought up, uh, uh, Kenny,
you know, Kay and Sharkey from,
[SPEAKER_02]: from, from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the first times I had honey oil
was from those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember it was this new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were getting the old hookah
coals and we were just burning a hookah
[SPEAKER_02]: coal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the original dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you just hit it on there with a
little glass tube or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah, I mean, brought that into,
yeah, I had roommates at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like 19 or 20 and, uh, we brought
that around and it just, it changed
[SPEAKER_02]: people's lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a few friends who were, uh,
you know, they were heroin addicts back
[SPEAKER_02]: then and they took a dab for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, Whoa, just sent them sore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I've never been this
high off of H let alone, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoa, it's like one person like literally
use that to kick heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was just honey oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, she felt like,
well, this, this is giving me the same
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I ran out of it, you know,
I realized like, Oh wow, that's how bad
[SPEAKER_02]: heroin addiction can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she was like pissed that she could
not get this anymore for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was going to relapse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh, sorry, I'll try,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that coal tech was the
original way before they had rigs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to smoke it on coal with a straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: You heat the coal up and you would have
your little dab or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You touch it there and hit it with the
straw and amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like our parents before us with the hot
knives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I used hot knives too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were like legendary hot knives.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those would take you to another
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, especially with the traditional hash
where you burn it and you would just get a
[SPEAKER_03]: cloud of smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your eyes would instantly turn red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't choke, you would be
completely frigging ripped off your ass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenny and them had, they had some good
strains back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember they had, uh, the sweet one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: B one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You purple, purple Kush.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was lucky enough, uh, through a
mutual friend to get a tray of clones from
[SPEAKER_02]: those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't realize at the time that I should
have held onto this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even, I think maybe Cain Sharkey
had already been doing some articles in
[SPEAKER_02]: high times, maybe at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but even still to this day,
I don't pay attention to things in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry like I used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's people who live,
eat and breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They read everything, watch everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I've, I've been doing this
for 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got kids, you know, and right now,
like I've, I've already sacrificed a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of family time, a lot of time with my wife
and my children for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I've, I've stepped away in the
last year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, my kids are only going to
be, you know, they're 10 and 12 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only going to be that age once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my son's going to get to that
age.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I was 15, I don't know,
bye dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got my friends now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I missed a lot of that because I was
always gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hustling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just so immersed in the cannabis
industry that for this last year and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half of not working in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, wow, there's a whole
nother world out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what the plant gives too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it takes and it gives and it's
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so finally I was just like,
I'm, I got laid off, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, I was expecting it,
you know, in the last seven years I've
[SPEAKER_02]: worked for six different companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when that layoff came and I was
like, well, I'm just going to spend time
[SPEAKER_02]: with my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I've been going so hard for
so long and the wife was just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, she's the one who actually said
like, you've been doing this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been going hard for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you take some time off?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, say no more honey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it took some time off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I gave all my plants away,
shut my rooms down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally have nothing going at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably been like one of the
best years of my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just, I'm not, I've just totally
stepped away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always love the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always love the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always love the people, but right now
I'm focused on my, my children,
[SPEAKER_02]: my wife and myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've, I've, yeah, I always was a
fisherman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always liked fishing here and there,
but in this last year, I've just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you give me time off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've got rods in the car right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as soon as I leave here,
I'm going to go hit a lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that's my Zen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, there's something about bass
fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mean to steer the conversation,
but it's this, it, it, it scratches that
[SPEAKER_02]: same itch that I had as a grower,
trying to figure out this plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out this fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what did I do right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did I, did I use this color bait?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that same feeling of like
accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm going to conquer this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just kind of filled that void
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of my focus, you know,
again, stepping away from the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: family, fishing, just life, you know,
cause my life has been this plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: this community, this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's come before everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we, I mean, you know,
as a grower, you, you miss holidays,
[SPEAKER_02]: you miss vacations, you miss those little
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't like, I mean, no matter how many
times I would try to not have to harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: at Christmas, it always landed like right
around Christmas time where I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, I can't go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you got to harvest again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, sorry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you have some people just
don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's, you're a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great in the sense that we,
especially when you're younger,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you learn about prioritizing
something that's bigger than yourself and
[SPEAKER_03]: more important than you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think a lot of us feel like we're
so important and it kind of gets rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: that ego to a degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you want to grow good flower,
you prioritize that plant first.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes before everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately families.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I met my wife, when I first started
dating her, and this has gone with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just about every girl I've ever
dated, like just so you know, you know who
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, but just so you know, like this will
always come before you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can hang with that, then we can
move forward with this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and my wife, you know,
I've, I've put her through some things,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, we almost moved up to salmon
Creek when she was, you know, eight months
[SPEAKER_02]: pregnant with my first son.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that guy backed out on me practically
when I already packed up my house here,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it was like this,
she's a square.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not from the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's not, you know, and here she is.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, sure, honey, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like, Ooh, that was a big
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean to put her through that,
um, and for her to still, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: stick around was like, wow, I got me a
trooper here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heard my wife threw a lot of shit over the
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's had to suffer when I suffered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she, she's accepted the good times and
the bad times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had a lot of good times.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had some bad times too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that's life,
but that also builds character.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think, uh, people are afraid
of bad times, but like no risk,
[SPEAKER_03]: no reward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a certain level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's the, what's the Latin saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortune favors the brave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the Latin translation,
but Brian will put it up on the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, you know, there's risk when,
whenever you're doing stuff, there's risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about like the level of risk
you're willing to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my wife has gone through the trenches
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not in the industry either,
but she's had to put up with all the
[SPEAKER_03]: bullshit that goes with it.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the lack of, and also I was a
chef too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like along with that where it's like,
okay, the kitchen comes first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was like, I had plants and the
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, it's, it's one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you start to like, you know,
you realize like, you know, wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty selfish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at least I did, you know,
I was just like, this is pretty selfish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like, I literally neglected,
you know, my personal, my close friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: my wife and my children, but then my,
my parents, my brother, just everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: around me suffered, you know, they reap
some of the benefits of it, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, they would have rather had me there
for that holiday, for that vacation,
[SPEAKER_02]: for that, even that weekend getaway,
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always put this you know,
first, you know, and it's, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: been nice to, to step away and not miss
things anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the balance back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go on vacation with your family and
you know, be able to go for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get offers for, you know,
jobs out of state and they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pay handsomely, you know,
but I'm not going to drag my family
[SPEAKER_02]: through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to move my family out of
state to go be somewhere that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that might only be for a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, it's going to be a nice
chunk of money, but it's only for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want, I'll, I'll take,
you know, something close to home.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't have to pay me six figures,
you know, and that's where I've just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stayed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had offers to go work in
other States and run big operations and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've, you know, no matter what price
they've thrown at me, I've just won't go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't drag my family through the
cannabis industry because it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do consulting in other places,
but I'm based in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my network of friends, although I
would love to live part of the year in
[SPEAKER_03]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I have my network of friends up
there that they're amazing, amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather up there right now in Seattle
is fricking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the food is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then same thing with Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind spending some time every
year in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have good friends too, but if you're in
Spain, you can just jump over to
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to any of those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did just, uh, visit Ireland in Northern
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to do some trout fish in there,
which was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tapped in to see what the industry is like
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just got some medical going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, found a couple of shops that sold
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Went in, you know, talked with the guys
and I had some regular seed on me,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I was asking them about
how can you, how come you guys got all the
[SPEAKER_02]: autos?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never understood why Europeans were
so heavy on the autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they explained the climate
and the growth season, they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got 60 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do full term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you guys do, you know, autos for a
beginner and someone who wants to see fast
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think a lot, a lot of people now
are like, uh, they want instant
[SPEAKER_03]: gratification, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And autos will give you that instant
gratification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause from germination, you can have
finished product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good with these better autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have good product in 65 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be smoking in a less than three
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have cured out product,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that with anything else from
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the genetics have gotten better and
better and better without a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 20 years ago, if you were brought
up, yeah, if you'd have brought up autos
[SPEAKER_02]: or rudorellas, I'd have laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, Hey, it was like,
Hey, it was a foundation to start from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that was a direction you wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, it was like, it was
production, you know, back then,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I wasn't trying to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for the, that was for the older
guys who had made their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just now R and D, just playing
around, making things here and there,
[SPEAKER_02]: having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine, it was work, work, work,
work, work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think before our time, it was all about
making seeds for the next year,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially up at Humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in the 60s, late 60s, 70s,
80s, early pit, probably 90s, a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers would, you know, they,
they were making seeds for that next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they'd make a handful of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were breeding, uh, those varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That were up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're almost land race varieties from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on what you define as a land
race, with some of these guys made them
[SPEAKER_03]: for 20 generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were making seeds every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when cloning got popular, especially
in the 90s, it's like we were growing a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot from clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'd pop seeds, but we cloned it and
then we'd show the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the thing with, you know,
back to the GDP cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cut, you know, and so when only
clone only, you know, and so when people,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I wasn't one of those
people, as a matter of fact, I had,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a person tell me, you know,
if, if, uh, you know, cause I wasn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: forum guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't on the forums back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I wasn't on the forums,
then I wasn't part of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Whoa, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I was putting, I was putting a
hundred thousand miles a year on my truck,
[SPEAKER_02]: driving boxes up and down the West coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have time to sit in front of a
computer and then argue the finer points
[SPEAKER_03]: of growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of that is just ego anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, um, so when people would
hit me, you know, you hit me up back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day and tell me that they had,
you know, a granddaddy purple male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, okay, you know,
like, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's been a lot of origin
stories about the GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, I've heard stories,
you know, there's been a lot of folklore
[SPEAKER_03]: about genetics all around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we didn't have the recorded
history of 20 years and before without the
[SPEAKER_03]: internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was I heard this from this person and
heard it from this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the guys were in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want to be known.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they were the real reader,
they didn't want to be known as the real
[SPEAKER_03]: reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want any credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my, that was my mentality.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my mentality back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was the, you know,
two 15 compassion, you know, thing going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom was a two 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, she actually, you know, she wasn't a
cannabis consumer at all, but she can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: she can't have pain for two 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: She believed in the plant and just not
just the medicine part of it, the hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like, hemp will save the world to
the point where when I was young,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, my mom was like, just repetitive
with it with my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know hemp this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know hemp that like, mom,
can we stop with the hemp thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here it is 25 years later and she's
still on that page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, when, when it became
legal, she's like, well now what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it turns out she was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and now she's a big fan or she,
she has rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She uses, uh, you know, cannabis to,
to help me, you know, manage her pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she's not, she was not like the
big pothead, you know, person,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's in her regiment now to help
her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had, my mom and dad had a CBD
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're done on other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a struggle, you know, when you're
competing against big, huge companies to
[SPEAKER_03]: do a boutique product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but they're big fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sanjay Gupta changed everything for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second 60 minutes came out and he's like,
how can you have a kid and tell them that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can't have the medicine that'll make
them better?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which that resonates with people that
don't smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should resonate with everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that has kids, it's like,
how, who are you to say that your kid is
[SPEAKER_03]: not allowed to take something that might
make them better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely won't harm them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you to say that they can't have
medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did someone recently tell me like,
well, you'll go to jail if you have your,
[SPEAKER_02]: just your kid's this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I'll plant my flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, this is the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your kid has seizures, how is that
anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, your kid is terminally
ill with fucking cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you to say that somebody else in
that situation shouldn't be able to try
[SPEAKER_03]: things that can only, you know,
I don't see any negative impact from using
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I mean, I'm talking about smoking
your lungs is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking your lungs is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could all agree on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But dealt with LTC taken orally as a
medicine, as a plant medicine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, there's a place for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody has an argument in my opinion
that it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, wrong to try wrong for you to
make a decision for yourself or for your
[SPEAKER_03]: children that might make them better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think so many people feel very
helpless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and especially the 20 years ago,
we were really helpless.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could go to jail for giving
your kid medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can still, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's, I mean, we'll get
there one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I didn't vote for 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people like us didn't
vote for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read it right away and was like,
oh, I thought it was going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: greatest thing for us, for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was reading it and I was like,
no, they didn't write this for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wrote this for big corporation,
you know, and you know, here we are seven
[SPEAKER_02]: years in and you know, every mom and pop
has been, you know, just about decimated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we're seeing a resurgence
and, but you look at Humboldt and Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: County is nothing compared to what it used
to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, yeah, it was traditional or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, the passion don't stemmed out of
Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: With something special and the flower
quality that came out of there,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the top shelf, you don't see,
I don't see that stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, not, not in the abundance
that it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if most people around today that
weren't around back then were to see that
[SPEAKER_03]: quality, that smoke, they would have a
different appreciation for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of people that are
like outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the real flavor,
especially if you get a good OG or
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's piney and earthy,
like you smoke it and you taste all of
[SPEAKER_03]: that pine, all of that earth citrus in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just, it's another one of
those feel good moments where like a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of that stuff you can smoke a day or
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smoke in the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same plant, indoor, outdoor, two different
highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two different highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's there on the indoor,
but that outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can have two completely different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then some of the stuff,
you might have to smoke more of it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not as concentrated, but like it
doesn't matter because you get that good
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was the same with GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like GDP wasn't, I mean, we didn't have
testing back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you didn't know how,
but I've heard, you know, like GDP is a
[SPEAKER_02]: low tester.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, well, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it tastes, it was the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might've had to smoke a little more,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tests in the twenties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it wasn't the, you know,
back in the one hitter quitters,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, one hit, you're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's been a while since I've had
a one hitter quitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been in creep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just smoked some creeper weed for the
first time in years and I forgot what
[SPEAKER_03]: creeper weed really is because I smoked
this stuff and it was given to me by John
[SPEAKER_03]: from Huckleberry Hill farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's called mother's mom's weed or
mother's weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me the white thorn rose,
which I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like smoking on that and
I'm like, I'm going to try some of this
[SPEAKER_03]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I rolled a joint of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm puffing this joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck, dude, this stuff's not
getting me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally knocking me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoked, I smoked probably a gram to my
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, fuck, this stuff didn't really
give me that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tastes all right, but it's not as
good as the white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm sitting on my couch and I do
this trivia thing on a, I play trivia,
[SPEAKER_03]: trivia quest or trivia, whatever it's on
Netflix.
Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trivia game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm playing that and I'm like 10
minutes in and all of a sudden I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, I feel great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had creeper weed in a long head
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long where it's like, you're not high,
you're not high, you're not high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden it creeps up on
you and you're like, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dick in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you consume a bunch of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but yeah, the delayed effect from
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used to have stuff like that where
you wouldn't, you'd be a little bit high
[SPEAKER_03]: off of smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you take a bonger up, you'd feel
little head change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, 15 minutes
later, you're like, can't even open your
[SPEAKER_03]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've noticed that too, you know,
stepping away from the industry like I
[SPEAKER_02]: have, you know, and I had variety,
you know, everyone was always throwing
[SPEAKER_02]: samples at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just smoking stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, now I'm focused on other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not smoking as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I do smoke, now I'm just like,
Whoa, I get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like high school high,
like I did back in the day, like chems
[SPEAKER_02]: always do that to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I love chems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always call it high school high because
it gets you to that level of high where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, shit, everyone knows I'm
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and chems, no matter what,
no matter, I mean, it's like, I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: personally, my endocannabinoid system,
I guess, does not have a tolerance to chem
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just gets me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just smoke it all night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the center was a low tester.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember testing some sour when they
first started doing testing, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: before it was steep hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was Heyland, I got Heyland
labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they tested some stuff and I still
have the testing results from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was sorority.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tested 12 and a half percent or 13%
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super low, but it was strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would, it would kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially compared to the stuff that's
like 25, 27, 30% now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff was strong and it's sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like couch lock weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you would smoke it and you would be
wrecked at 12%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad, you know, he's an old,
old school, longtime smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with my father-in-law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one thing that the
industry is missing is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they try to cater to that demographic,
that 21 to 35 year old male drives the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we have all this purple
gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have these guys from the
seventies and eighties who are in their
[SPEAKER_02]: seventies now and they want to come back
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've raised their families.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got their grandchildren now,
both my father and my father-in-law,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like the weed you guys have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just seems like to me,
like the market is missing this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: demographic of buyer because the THC
levels are so high and so through the roof
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've always, everywhere I've went,
I've always tried to push, give them,
[SPEAKER_02]: give them a one to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at 10% to 10%, something low key
for these, it'll bring those old smokers
[SPEAKER_02]: back into the fold.
[SPEAKER_03]: The white thorn rose, if you have a chance
to get it, if I can get some, I'll get you
[SPEAKER_03]: some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: With those guys and to give it to those
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I feel like I just want to give it
out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm growing some blue 13 and I'm going
to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it out to all the OGs,
all the older guys that don't want strong
[SPEAKER_03]: weed, but want the good effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's certain varieties that just
make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel, and I don't know, I haven't
done enough testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all anecdotal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all just on me and I feel like
there's a lot of people that would
[SPEAKER_03]: probably benefit from it where they smoke
it and they just feel great and they would
[SPEAKER_03]: love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would want to smoke more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would just enjoy weed again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like some people it's too
strong or whatever, or some people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are lightweights and it makes them,
you know, they get a heart palpitations or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, but if they smoke this
stuff, they would probably feel good and
[SPEAKER_03]: be happy and be like, yeah, I like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, and again,
though, you know, try back to the 10 week
[SPEAKER_02]: strains in a commercial production.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't do it, you know, just,
it doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The demographic who's going to buy this is
too small.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was a gentleman who,
who, who came to us, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the companies I was working for and
he was trying to pitch that same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came to me first through a
connection of a mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Hey, Jimmy, I got this buddy,
Jerry, I want to introduce you to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a, he's a marketing guy, not even a
weed guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he comes and he pitches this whole,
and when he starts pitching low THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, yeah, yes, I have been
talking about this for the last five
[SPEAKER_02]: years, six years in companies trying to,
and here he had the whole marketing deal
[SPEAKER_02]: packaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was this low, low,
you know, low THC, a light beer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a day beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, you know, kind of,
you know, it's a daytime smoke or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, or for, you know, that guy from who
used to smoke in the seventies and the
[SPEAKER_02]: eighties who only had 10 and 12%,
you know, THC back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've, I've smoked some really cool
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke CBG and I'm working on some CBG
stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I think some of those guys
would love CBG because it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: get you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does make you feel different though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get a little bit of head change,
whereas you're not really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could, I could smoke it any time of
the day and not be high, but it does make
[SPEAKER_03]: me feel super relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think some of those guys that used
to smoke just the leaves, maybe that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what it did it for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe there was CBG that they were
smoking too, because it's a precursor that
[SPEAKER_03]: turns into CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then, you know, we,
you know, back in the day we had
[SPEAKER_02]: pretendica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think back then now,
now what we know now, those were CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are CBD dominant strains that we
just stole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't even get you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get you high, you know,
and, but it looked just like the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that got you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have testing, so we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pretendica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pretendica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, you bring up CBG and I
really would like to try some myself
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've heard a lot of good things
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you don't want to
necessarily be high, but you just want to
[SPEAKER_03]: relax and chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great alternative to
cigarettes for all you cigarette smokers
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great way to go because you
do get in effect, but it's not like you're
[SPEAKER_03]: so high, you can't work or you can't do
this or you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fork kind of high to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're just elevated or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just elevated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost relaxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like ibuprofen is for, for me,
when I take guys, I don't take ibuprofen a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot, but I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take it, ibuprofen really relaxes
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never caught that effect from ibuprofen,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just, it's a muscle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It relaxes your muscles, but I,
that makes me, I could sleep when I take
[SPEAKER_03]: ibuprofen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm always working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sleep that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I take Benadryl or I take ibuprofen to
make you tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten that way too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm in my fifties now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten to that point where if I sit
on the, if I sit on the couch for too
[SPEAKER_02]: long, I'm out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten to that age.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel like because I work so much
when I do sit on the couch, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going, I want to get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of those guys that I'm halfway
through the movie.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, you know, my wife, she's like,
your head hits that pillow and within five
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes you're, and I say, I know that's
how I run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, that could be at nine
o'clock at night, four 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wide awake, you know, like every
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a five a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: shorty guy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, my, my time is five.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if I'm not staying up,
like on a, let's say on a Saturday,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll, I'll wake up at five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might just go walk around a little bit
and then I go back to bed, but I'm always
[SPEAKER_03]: up at five, like five, four 49 to five o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to be getting old, but at the
same time, man, I've got to, I have a fake
[SPEAKER_02]: hip now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had, I got ankle reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to give me another new ankle
cause I'm bone to bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another reason, you know, like I'm
falling apart physically, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just from all of the, you know,
the cannabis industry work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being a farmer, doing this stuff
my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Passion for the sake of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's, it's really,
it's, it's starting to take an effect on
[SPEAKER_02]: my body, you know, physically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, you know, and I always promote,
you know, melanoma awareness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had melanoma, I've had skin
cancer, you know, and to all you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, young growers out there who,
you know, you're out there doing your full
[SPEAKER_02]: terms and you're in the sun all day and,
you know, cover yourself up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important, you know, cause not only
that, like I spend, you know, my day is
[SPEAKER_02]: out in the sun and then I'll go into an
indoor room where I have UV pounded me all
[SPEAKER_02]: day long too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get your sunscreen in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy this American stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll probably get some heat for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I'm not a fan of sunscreen period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just greasy, oily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, now I have a UV protective
clothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wear a UV gaiter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wear a long sleeve cause I just don't
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think some of these, these creams
and some of these lotions, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, these SPF lotions can cause
cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not an expert on the subject,
but I know in Europe they're a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: healthier and they're a lot cleaner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't test them on animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the ones in the state, you have to
test them on animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first time, it was my first time
going to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Ireland and to see their culture
compared to ours, all the things that they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have in their food and in their
products and, and, and their society was
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of just, it was an eye opener to
me, you know, like, Whoa, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they don't even have high fructose
corn syrup band.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, uh, so it was just
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food tasted different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the bread for me, the bread,
it, I digest the bread better for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I digest the bread in Europe better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something with the better quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roundup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's no roundup over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all fucking banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring that up and I'm like,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I applied hundreds of gallons of roundup
on the weekend as a state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a state license.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a QAC, uh, I, you know,
for a while there, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: started a family, you know, dad's like,
you got to get a real job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, you know, I've got to get
some benefits here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gets me in, uh, with the state
applying, you know, being a pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: applicator and so, uh, glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I ended up, yeah, you know,
becoming a state applicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's where I got my education,
basically like understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had that, you know, and then here
comes legalization around, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I realized, Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of my friends who are now going into
this legal thing, they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: follow all of these rules, all these ag
rules and all of these pesticide safety
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was able to come into places and
explain to people who thought they had
[SPEAKER_02]: like the full compliance program,
you know, well, we've got everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys doing your pesticide use
reports?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you're not doing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing your monthly pesticide
use reports either.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's where you have to report all
the stuff that you've applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I already knew this whole system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when legalization came around,
I read it like, Oh, this isn't for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for corporations and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of pivoted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'll do this consulting thing,
you know, where I'm helping my friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who don't know, and we're the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be hard on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been through inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're waiting for just, just give us a
reason to, you know, to, to write you up
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you know, that's not in
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so, you know, I already knew how
to run these programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was super confident in selling
that information to people and going in
[SPEAKER_02]: and setting up IPM programs and reporting
and record keeping and all that stuff from
[SPEAKER_02]: my past, you know, as being an applicator
with the state for a while there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, I only did that, you know,
for like two or three years I ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: getting injured because of union rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to give up my position, which I was
kind of fine because most of the time all
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing was applying glyphosate on the
weekends, hundreds and hundreds of gallons
[SPEAKER_02]: every weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I was just like,
you know, this, this is not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: being an applicator is not a career.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you want to do for 25,
30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I got injured and I had to like
give up that position as an applicator,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was perfectly fine with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, you know, and that's when I
had to get my first ankle reconstructed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just pivoted, you know,
took that and like switched it over to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still do, you know, people still hit
me up who were having, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about compliance or,
you know, just, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: recipes that I've.
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and a lot of them are friends
and homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, you know, I just,
I want to see them succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want you to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to charge you for what I've
no, I mean, this, we were all,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this, this all started off as,
you know, we all shared the information
[SPEAKER_02]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With cool people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a good person.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a good person, you're going to
be a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the other thing is back in
the day, you know, if you were a shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, well, that's because everyone you
knew was a shitty grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a shitty network, you know,
if you were a good girl, it's cause you
[SPEAKER_02]: had good people around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think a lot of people got by
because I had friends that were shitty
[SPEAKER_03]: growers and I had friends that were
amazing growers, but the shitty growers
[SPEAKER_03]: still got by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people would still buy weed for a
good amount of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those guys are long gone because
people won't pay for a shitty weed now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $300.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs you more than $300 to produce a
pound and there's shitty pounds for $300.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when, when all that BC came around,
it just really wrecked the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really just destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden you had this middle
category, you know, that was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the brown weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: From like 97, there was like a decline in
the home grows until 2001.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the world trade center happened,
nine 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden the borders were
locked down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the BC bud wasn't coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all of a sudden home grows started
popping up again, like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was this resurgence of all this
stuff and people were striving to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of people were like just
resting on their laurels.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grew good enough weed and they were
still making a good, like you could make a
[SPEAKER_02]: good living if you were just willing to
grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, in my whole thing here, you said the
good enough weed, it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you grow good weed, it sells itself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best part about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was always fortunate enough to be
a good grower to where my stuff was sold
[SPEAKER_02]: before it was even dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they were just waiting for me to
say, they would take it when it was still
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was one of those guys, I would,
I would drive for three and four weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I want a long, slow drive
with a cure and all that's really bring
[SPEAKER_02]: that flavor out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had a network of friends who
were doing OG and they would send that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff down to, you know, LA half soggy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's dry, but yeah, but by the
time it got to LA, it sweated out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't burping it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weren't burping it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just was all gooey and the guys were
still taking it down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah, but eventually they're going
to find someone who has same, had a better
[SPEAKER_02]: quality at the same price and you're out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always made sure that,
yeah, I grew the best that I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always sold ahead of time because
if it was sub par, now you're having to
[SPEAKER_02]: shop at everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it was just, oh,
saleable for you, saleable for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your price goes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your price drops and drops and
drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas you could hold a good price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, especially back in those days
when it was 4,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you had the best,
it'd sell itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have to worry about it unless
you grew Blue Dream at a certain point or
[SPEAKER_02]: GDP at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a certain point, you know, but you
know, if, you know, Blueberry Hayes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, always, no, it's not Blue Dream,
it's Blueberry Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the rename game was big back then too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When granddaddy perp came out,
you know, that was, you know, where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, things got confusing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause it was like, wait a
second, you know, where did this come
[SPEAKER_02]: from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, how come I got granddaddy perp
seeds, but how come my plants are green?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how come it's not purple like
the granddaddy purple that we used to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the third floor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cause it's two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was the Fino of the green
granddaddy perp that was going around that
[SPEAKER_03]: would like maybe purple a little bit,
but just a little on the inside,
[SPEAKER_02]: deep in.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a green plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the, that was the inferior.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people would show me the,
you know, the, the picture of their
[SPEAKER_02]: granddaddy purple plant and it was green.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean it's not it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I don't want to like real GDP blacks
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would tell people like, and I don't
want to cause you know, people take a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of pride and we take pride in our work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and these, you know,
people were very proud, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they had GDP and they were working
with GDP and then they would show me and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would be like, eh, you know, and it's
like, it was really hard, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to not, I was like, well, Hey,
that's, that's how you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but just a lot of that stuff
went around dispensaries too, where they
[SPEAKER_03]: had like green GDP and it's like,
how can it be green?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a green.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called GDP for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, when I let the cut go,
finally, I think like around in 2005,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, OG had kind of taken over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple was fading out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to a group of guys in San
Francisco and a group of guys in Oakland
[SPEAKER_02]: where they went with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it went up, made it up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it did for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure it was in Colorado and
East coast and stuff like that too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I remember from here when they started
selling clones of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy clones of dispensary GDP and it
was maybe 2005 or six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's about right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of, I mean, by then I had
let it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, not saying only I had it because I,
it came to me as a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else up in Humboldt had it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to them, it was just the perp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe they didn't know that,
say, hey, this other guy who got it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they took it down to the Bay area and now
it's granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point it was being sold as Mendo
perp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was only one person who actually
like came really close and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: Brandon from Dimebreed Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came to me with a bag and he was just
like, smell this, look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as I smelled it, I was like,
that's granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was, I knew you wouldn't,
you know, he gave me a cut and I held onto
[SPEAKER_02]: that cut for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought it was great babe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I thought the cut was great babe
because it just didn't have that
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The GDP had those long, you know,
leafs that kind of overlapped each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and this didn't have that look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, ah, this, this might be
a watered down granddaddy purple might be
[SPEAKER_02]: a great babe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the closest that it came.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to anyone, you know,
getting close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was his.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone was process.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a granddaddy purple backcross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some company, you know, when I was
running processing for Lowell,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were doing third party processing and
they brought in, you know, granddaddy
[SPEAKER_02]: purple backcross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so excited to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was just like, damn,
this isn't it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have the look.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't definitely didn't have the
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The structure was way off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's, I'm not going to start
going into what crosses out GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't named.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they, people don't admit that GDP
was in there, but there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that I think is amazing throughout
the last 15 years that they've crossed
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there may be hasn't gotten its fair
credit, but if you add a one piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: advice, I usually go for your younger
self, but let's talk about for growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the one piece of advice that you
would give for guys that are starting out
[SPEAKER_03]: with their girls?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I'm, I'm lately,
I've been in a real, uh, different
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fairly pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not too optimistic about this industry
much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people come to me and they tell me
they want to get into the two,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm no, don't let me tell you all the
things that will go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you all how much it's going to
cost you and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they still, and so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm just, if you want someone to
pick you up and I'm not that guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say do it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for the passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't think you're going to be,
you know, cause it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the R and D is expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unless you're a guy who,
you know, has a network where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: sending stuff out of, you know,
out of town or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're doing traditional market
and that's your own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the people who are trying to step
into, you know, what we have now is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 64 I wouldn't advise,
I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just, it takes too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you got to be able to work out a
loss, you know, and take some real hard
[SPEAKER_02]: hits for the first five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can financially survive that,
then, you know, you might have a place at
[SPEAKER_02]: the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're just, you know, again,
if you're just, you know, firing up your
[SPEAKER_02]: garage for yourself, throwing a four
lighter in there, man, just have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it for the fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but you know, do it,
do it for fun and do it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, you know, it gets to this point
where it's like my energy bill,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on a residential rate,
it's through the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a one lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a one lighter, get some LEDs,
do it small, because it gets to the point
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're like, wow, I could go buy
even an overpriced ounce in the dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: for almost cheaper than when I'm growing
it in my, on my residential rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that's, and that's where,
you know, I was always on a residential
[SPEAKER_02]: rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had a commercial setup,
you know, I had access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always paid for power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always paid for power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, back in the day, I had friends and
we, we did big hunter lighters in Oakland
[SPEAKER_02]: where yeah, jumping the power was a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to go though, the only way to
go for your power, they bust you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I think there was even a time
up North where they would infrared your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your power line and see it all just
glowing and oh, this guy's pulling,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how many amps, you know,
and then you would see like the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or in places where it was cold
and there was that one room in the corner
[SPEAKER_02]: where the snow didn't stick, you know,
because you had a, you know, 90 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, just, you know, do it for
yourself, do it for the passion,
[SPEAKER_02]: do it for the love of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is probably one of the more funner
hobbies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really get into it, it will consume
your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be, you will race home to get to
that plant, to get to that grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: to check your numbers, to, you know,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the funny thing is, is when you grow
your own, it's always good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you always think it's, I feel like
most of my friends think their weed is the
[SPEAKER_03]: best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pride involved with sharing and
there's something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a home grower that gets to
either grow from seed or grow from clone
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get to experience that plant for
three weeks of edge, 60, three days of
[SPEAKER_03]: flower, whatever it is, maybe it's 54,
maybe it's 70 days of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got to dry it and cure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these little things that you
can screw up and then to get something
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, that's something to be proud
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think being able to smoke your own stuff
and know what that plant went through and
[SPEAKER_03]: have that relationship with that plant and
then consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with growing vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's where I always had the
green thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents, we always had a vegetable
garden everywhere that I've always had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always had a massive vegetable
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's pictures of me in buckets when I
was five years old, like five gallon big
[SPEAKER_03]: metal ones because they didn't have
plastic buckets back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for a while there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, growing was all encompassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had like 60 houseplants at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would have to spend one day out
of my week just feeding houseplants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had the vegetable garden,
which there was a lot of drip going on
[SPEAKER_02]: there and took care of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally, you just have to toss some
compost out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every one of my neighbors always was,
you know, free vegetables, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like even if you didn't want them too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting free vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting free vegetables on your
porch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's getting free vegetables,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I always had my full
terms and then had my indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, rarely does one's occupation
become who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always tell people like,
no, this is who I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's become who I am, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and the plant's given you a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've given a lot to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on some level, it's like what you put
in is what you get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're an example of somebody that's
put in a lifetime dedicated to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plant's given back to you on many
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's provided me a book worthy,
you know, book worthy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people always say I should write
a book about all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's part of me is like,
yeah, yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, yeah, there's some
stories in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, that's why these podcasts are
great, because we get the oral history of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and we get, you know,
before history was told by the perspective
[SPEAKER_03]: of one person or a handful of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now with things like podcasts and
YouTube and Instagram, we can get a real
[SPEAKER_03]: vivid picture of the reality of the
situation, because you're not just taking
[SPEAKER_03]: one person's perspective, you're taking
two hundred people from now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be part of that, because I think
we're all part of this bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the especially with cannabis is
like I did my thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done your thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've done things outside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done things with food and with other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all part of this network of
amazing things that happen to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: world like it is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super fortunate, super lucky to be in to
be, you know, again, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the things that I did back then didn't you
know, I didn't think like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 years from now, this is going to this
is going to be like a story people are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to want to hear about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I mean, to be honest,
I was super reluctant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people have been pushing me to
do just this very thing that we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to tell this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we all know the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all heard these stories from you for
years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the community doesn't know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of me was just like, I don't
really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let this story be where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and as a matter of fact,
you know, it kind of feels like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Al Bundy live in his glory days
as a football player.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, yeah, I did the GDP
thing back then, but that's all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all part of my past now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it comes up, you know,
here it is legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, everyone's talking
about it again and all these stories and
[SPEAKER_02]: the origin histories of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK, I guess I need to get
out there and tell the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I went on that one podcast like
a year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and you can this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Future Canvas Project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I told the story on there,
you know, and I'm also, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I never went back and watched any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never read any of the comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I'm kind of done and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like same with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll watch this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send it to my family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know I'm going to get some
pushback.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's going to be some people
who, you know, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always pushback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's always pushback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's got a story and it's like,
you know, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a GDP story, a granddaddy
purple story that predates 99,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's hear it because then maybe
you have me predated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you, you know,
I was in the Oakshire Dam scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no granddaddy purple at that
time, you know, until the third floor
[SPEAKER_02]: named it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a few years later,
Ken released his seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and and Ken got the credit for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time, like I didn't even
realize that there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, credit, you know, like he was
getting credit for this because I wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: on the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't keeping up with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can call his Ken's GDP and it's
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like he's got his thing and
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, the one thing is he did,
you know, he called it granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it was granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is that subtle difference,
which is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, back then he used to put all the
strains on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would tell you what he used to make
that those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of them were were granddaddy
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never got a cut because I never put it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless you knew who it came from,
if it came from up north, you weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get it either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people say, you know,
there was probably purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just the way that I grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've grown Urkel and I've smoked Urkel
and like it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have access to Urkel now,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like Urkel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could do I could tell you that I
think they're maybe related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that Urkel might be the parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible for or the lineage is the
same from the same region of wherever it
[SPEAKER_03]: came.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came down through some Urkel,
you know, or Urkel and GDP at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have similar genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, especially if you look at
compared to the purple cushions that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen and, you know, all the other purple
things that I've seen over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two that are kind of
closely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Closely resemble each other in some ways.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavors off though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavors off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavors off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavors with lavender is completely
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Urkel is very soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very it's more subtle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas GDP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is like Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Urkel on steroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, you know, know back then that I
should hold on to this cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just it faded again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when that OG came around,
even I at a time was like, OK,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, it's time to pivot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, CSI Hubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure he's got the real cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but me and him have had a few
exchanges online about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, you know, he posted some pictures
of GDP and it was green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said something like real GDP is
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of fired up some people,
you know, and I actually apologize because
[SPEAKER_02]: he was trying to sell these, you know,
he was trying to sell these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I was, you know, kind of blasting
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: This finished green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I saw the clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But was it where your clones purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it started getting purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Halfway through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Halfway through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get that deep set about the
sixth week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would go dark, dark, dark,
dark midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I wrote him and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't have, you know, I should have
privately written you and expressed this
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at the time, you know,
he didn't maybe I don't think he knew
[SPEAKER_02]: about the GDP story with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just some rando online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would be like, yeah,
whatever, pal, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if he does again, I mean,
I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't smelt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The closest that that that I came to,
though, was just with dying breed seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: with Brandon that one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one bag one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He showed it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I might have some photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll have to give you some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll dig out some photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely have photos of the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably have some photos of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew God's gift for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had that they had the taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it had that little gas note to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still had a deep purple because we had
that cut in Santa Cruz Mountains,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for a while there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was floating around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, I want to say Ricky, Ricky out in
the home out in Santa Cruz County.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the name of his his little his
little company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people like to give him credit
for that God's gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I don't know if God's gift is
Canadian or if it's from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love to get those guys on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the same with the other Santa
Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people in Santa Cruz
are like, yeah, it's actually Davenport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Grass Valley or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and then there's the grass valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's different cuts,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, is with Blue Dream,
if you make S ones of it, the S ones are I
[SPEAKER_03]: think is one of the most stable,
stable crosses that's ever been made is
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream because you take it and there's
only four different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, you get one that's dead on Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a dead on Blue Dream seed from
the Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get one that has the structure,
one that has the smell and then one that
[SPEAKER_03]: has all of it and then one that's not
really very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but still with that, I mean,
you can see how the S ones could be
[SPEAKER_03]: slightly different, but it definitely
resembles and definitely his Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Santa Cruz GoFarm Pac-Man out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he definitely reversed the Arcada
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he might have even reversed the
the Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was the Hayes brothers that
created Santa Cruz Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Hayes brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they created Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that any is that relation to Big Sur
Big Sur Holy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so, because I think I like
the Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that Mojave Richmond is the one who
introduced me to Big Sur Holy Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very hazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I think of haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was Papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Papaya Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some relation to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was a little blurred line
there with those two as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Crack is the one that the high just
goes away real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like super fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's on set really fast,
but you build a tolerance to it real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you don't get high from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to where like it's like pretend a guy
like I could smoke huge joints of Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well be smoking a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, thank you so much for coming
on the show today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people are looking to get a hold of
you, I guess they probably shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not only we as people are trying to
get a hold of you because you have Myers
[SPEAKER_02]: Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got Myers Creek dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a website there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's you won't find any of my seeds
on there just because one of the service
[SPEAKER_02]: providers are not allowing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't tried to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of guys are able to able to
do it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't sat down.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you need to do is talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't put my seeds up on a
site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I mean, but if you just write me up
on their orders at Myers Creek dot com.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, say you saw some of my gear on
IG and want to get a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at this point, I've given out so
much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm only trying to like
basically, you know, sell the merchandise,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hoodies, the hats, all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you want a pack of seeds,
buy a hoodie and you'll get a pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, this is the old school
way of doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy the T-shirt and you get the weed for
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of, you know, that old way of
doing things like the seeds are free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're buying a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hemp anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've got, you know, IG,
you know, you can get to me on there to
[SPEAKER_02]: Myers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myers dot Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Myers Creek dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to do this in real
fishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_06]: And.
[SPEAKER_06]: And.
[SPEAKER_06]: And.
[SPEAKER_06]: And.
[SPEAKER_06]: And.
And.
