Music
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, our special guest is Nat
Pennington from Humble Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wild ride getting down here with
this crazy bomb cyclone that we're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we've been trying to get together
like this, hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Hallie on an episode, I think five
episodes ago, four episodes, something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got really lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hallie's my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really great that you guys
got her in there, because she's really
[SPEAKER_00]: grown up in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's seen it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have the second or third
generation people come on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they have a different story,
especially growing up when you're fully
[SPEAKER_01]: immersed into it from the time you were a
little kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then growing up and evolving and
seeing the world, it's changed so much in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 20 years especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could go over the stories,
but I'm sure that you guys probably
[SPEAKER_00]: covered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a little bit about your story,
especially with salmon and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis breeding was out of necessity
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in the late 90s when I was
growing in the woods, gorilla style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, we didn't have nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the Amsterdam seed scene going
on, but it wasn't as accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, for me, I was like,
well, I should just probably figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make sure I have my own starting
material for the next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that just seeds made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never once thought that it would end
with being a career and something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been able to share with so many
different cannabis enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of us are that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're a chef, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's inspiration from being a
tastemaker or- When High Times Magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: was my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys like Playboy Magazine when we
were teenagers or whatever, my thing was
[SPEAKER_01]: High Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the thing that got me the most
excited was reading about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing cannabis and seeing these people
from around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ariane Roskam and all these other guys
that were very inspirational to me from a
[SPEAKER_01]: very young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, those were the people I looked
up to when I was a kid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you asked about the whole salmon thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back then, I mean, I was in love
with fixing the rivers and helping restore
[SPEAKER_00]: salmon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were passions with the breeding
and passions with doing salmon stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you certainly weren't, at least not in
California and Humboldt or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: making careers and shouting from a
mountaintop, we're selling cannabis seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my job that I chose to have as my
front end job was the salmon restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was doing restoration work,
which did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with Dundee and the Klamath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a 20-plus year project that we
just finished off.
[SPEAKER_00]: World's largest dam removal and world's
largest river restoration project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely amazing, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I am not at all saying that it took
so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like and really like tribes were so
essential that our Native American tribes
[SPEAKER_00]: up there in Humboldt and Humboldt and all
the way up the river, really Warren
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffett ended up owning the dams because
it went from a one power company to
[SPEAKER_00]: another kind of midway through our fight
against the relicensure of the dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would have been like another 50
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the impetus to really kick
into gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Berkshire Hathaway, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warren Buffett, ended up owning Pacific
Corps or Pacific Power, which like
[SPEAKER_00]: provides Oregon, Idaho, Montana,
a lot of the power up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dams are on the border of
California and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the utility commission line is
literally at Humboldt County and Siskiyou
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the county north of us is powered by
the group we were fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owned by Warren Buffett.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we're all on PG&E,
of course, which is their own horrific
[SPEAKER_00]: story of corporate greed that we've all
been dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like my house, you know, I pay a power
bill to PG&E, but you go, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not very far up that river and it's
Pacific Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, just battling those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really grassrootsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, I did a lot of the grassroots
stuff, but I also got really involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some genomics work around salmon and
worked at the Salmon River Restoration
[SPEAKER_00]: Council as their fisheries program
coordinator for like 10 years and did just
[SPEAKER_00]: general salmon biology work doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the highlights was getting a
grant to do genetic research and
[SPEAKER_00]: determining the difference between two
different runs of salmon that are of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same species, but you could call them
subspecies because they acted so
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: One being a springtime migrator and then
the fall run Chinook, which is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little bit more commonplace across,
you know, even across the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neat area up there because the
tribes are really intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this like cool culture that is
actually still a living, growing culture
[SPEAKER_00]: to anybody who lives there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, tribes in particular,
a salmon that navigates the waterways in
[SPEAKER_00]: April, May, and June is just such like an
amazing blessing because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always like, well, I'm restoring
salmon so I can eat more of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hate to sound like, you know,
some people might not appreciate how that
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds, but if you ask me, like the very
best way to take care of Earth is to like
[SPEAKER_00]: live with her or whatever and,
you know, eating what was, I kind of feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like meant to be our sustenance as much as
you can is kind of cool actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that spring run salmon,
oh my God, it's the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finished in Swedish, so I couldn't
agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having respect for our food is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like respect for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that genomic study and ended up
being work at UC Davis where I just had
[SPEAKER_00]: this crash course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not a geneticist by training,
but it's something that it really ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: looking into a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the study was published in Science
Magazine, which is kind of the crowning
[SPEAKER_00]: publication that you can publish your
research in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another one, a follow-up one,
where we had discovered some salmon bones
[SPEAKER_00]: that were in caves, you know, likely or
more than likely from indigenous peoples
[SPEAKER_00]: that were in the upper, upper Klamath
above where those dams were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of our first research,
we were now able to sequence, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: salmon remains that were like 5,000 years
old and be able to tell what type they
[SPEAKER_00]: were, whether they were like running up
the river in spring or running up in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that might just sound like
minutia or whatever, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important stuff when it comes down to like
managing a river system and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring back an intact salmon run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the similarities to now, what's also
interesting to me, you know, just as an
[SPEAKER_00]: example, like auto flower and photo period
cannabis, Cornell just published a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: that is so similar to like what we did to
find the marker for, and I'm sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: very familiar with like what we call
marker assisted breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think a lot of people are like,
oh my gosh, this all of a sudden they
[SPEAKER_01]: think you're gene editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing editing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge difference between,
you know, running around willy nilly and
[SPEAKER_00]: slapping spider DNA into other species and
doing learning looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: A genome is like a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to read a book, you know,
like more power too, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and that's always what I'm like,
you know, basically if you, you can think
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want about GMO CRISPR gene
editing and all that, anyone who,
[SPEAKER_00]: who looks at you sideways when you say
you're, you're trying to understand more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the genetic background of an
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, well, why would you not
want more knowledge, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply just knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it can be so incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Cornell did, they published,
they found that one spot in the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: where auto flower and photo period are
differentiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes it so basically like,
you know, as you very well know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you make a cross of an auto and a
photo, you're going to have progeny that
[SPEAKER_00]: inherits all auto of, you know,
kind of took all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some that took all the photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the F1 generation, a lot of people
are confused because the F1 generation is
[SPEAKER_01]: not an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fast flowering variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get traits that are,
you know, passed from the auto flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which make it trigger faster, make it
finish faster, but it's not a true auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need two of the recessive genes
together to make it express auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but it also, as you well know,
goes to how pure bread or how homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: are your two parental lines, because when
you have not like parental lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: like so many of the cannabis genetic lines
that we see in the space these days that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not at all homozygous or stable or
pure bread, whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: them, which is like 99.9% of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the quick, but you can also
sort, you can actually end up with more
[SPEAKER_00]: full inheritance on one end and full
inheritance on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's so, I think it's so
much more useful to be able to always say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you don't have stable lines
and uniform, then it's not as scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: because the core of science is being able
to do an experiment and repeat it again
[SPEAKER_00]: and have the same outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to really do that is to
have some, some uniformity in the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: well, now we're getting deep though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now we're getting into the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the best way to do that is with
data-driven breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more, you know, the more power you
have to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even tools like AI and their
potential in our space is just huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people don't fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're scared of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like AI with data-driven breeding and
then predictive modeling where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: take all your genetic material,
have a data base with all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell the AI program exactly
what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can help you get to that path
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'm always like,
well, this ain't, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I know we probably get pitched by
the same we do and our genes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love those guys, but I'm always
reminding them like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is not soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not trying to breed something
that is going to make our cows grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest or, you know, highest protein
content, highest oil content, most disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are variables that are consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it seems like people care about THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as that is frustrating
sometimes to see, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can breed for those individual sort of
data points, but I know that folks like
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I aren't, aren't in it for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, it's, it's an art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe you know, it's also
something like, you know, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying this amazing whiskey that
you're sharing with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, it's the, I got these
glasses cause I had issues with the cornea
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch in my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the first time I'm having a sip of
alcohol in about three weeks since I
[SPEAKER_00]: scratched my cornea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, it's very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you and I enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, as much as,
you know, we can get help and we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting help from AI models and we should
be getting help from genetic sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this isn't something that I would
encourage the Bayers of the world to just
[SPEAKER_00]: jump right into because they're going to
find out real quick that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer is a, like subjective to the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, I think that this is
amazing whiskey, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very well could be some whiskey aficionado
who could walk in right behind me and tell
[SPEAKER_00]: me that's swill garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my Jack Daniels, you know,
or whatever it is, you know, and that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the difference between drug
discovery and the recreational model or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the model that we're in,
which is somewhere in between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think, it's so subjective to
the individual and our unique body
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry is very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how the plant responds to us can be
completely different from one person to
[SPEAKER_01]: the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's an art form.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a great space right now,
because I feel like we're still in the
[SPEAKER_01]: infancy of it to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're only going to improve on
stuff, but there's, you know, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of snake oil out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of bad breeding out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff going on that's
going to change over the next 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of us that have been in this
for long enough, we've like learned a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: from all the hype and trends that,
that come and go and learned about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: snake oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that you've also come to the
conclusion after a time of potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: like chasing the, some of those dead ends
that like James knows what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you're an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are an absolute aficionado expert of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, you know, hope to think that I
have some expertise and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's folks like us that I think
honestly, our best, you know, what people
[SPEAKER_00]: will discover eventually that like,
you know, just have faith in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, you know, season vets that have
been loving this thing for since 91 for me
[SPEAKER_00]: since 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since 91, I started smoking in 91 and fell
in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably, I was 12 years
old, a skater kid and like in the gully,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with the other skater kids that
were much older had my first tokes and
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have been probably like 91,
literally 90, 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're right on par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I moved to Humboldt in
95 and then it wasn't on like just a
[SPEAKER_00]: pilgrimage to, to go to this weed Mecca of
the world at the time, or at least the U S
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, it just happened to be that I
ended up there traveling the country with
[SPEAKER_00]: my, my girlfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just stayed, fell in love with that
place in general and weed, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that place, you know, like,
yeah, I can't go to Humboldt too often
[SPEAKER_01]: because I might've been moving there to be
honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I got, we have a lot of good
mutual friends and I go up there and visit
[SPEAKER_01]: like the guys from Royal gold and it's
like, it's just, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I moved to Humboldt, Rick was one
of the first people that I ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you know, tight buddies with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lived together actually on a hippie
commune together for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very, very relaxed, like not
culty kind of a thing, but after the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer of love and all that, you know,
some of those hippies, like they call them
[SPEAKER_00]: the diggers and they were sort of the
hippies that were like more, let's get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get roots of what this
counterculture movement is, which is to
[SPEAKER_00]: like make our own way and, and not be so
conventionally tied and in the anti war
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, then they, Janice Joplin,
people contributed money to buy this piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of land up there and it was called black
bear and it still exists actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick and I landed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did like a brief stint chasing around
the grateful dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jerry Garcia of course died.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was a rough year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the year that I just,
you know, didn't, I mean, my girlfriend
[SPEAKER_00]: and I, we had gone to many dead shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick and I both landed there at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've known Rick and, and Rob Gale,
a humble Terp council.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all lived at that place in the 95,
96 kind of timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then of course that was when the
proposition two 15 came to pass 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hitchhiked from that commune to go get
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't inspired by like fucking Bill
Clinton running for president for his
[SPEAKER_00]: second term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was inspired to go register to vote to
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On proposition two 15, which the first
legalization of cannabis in any way,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape or form kind of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe that's not, there's been
some things, but it was the major one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the major one that really put us on
the path to where we are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without prop 15, I don't know if we would
be where we're at today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to shout out, you know,
the Dennis Perrone types of Dennis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was the big push, but there was
other people, people in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: even like Ken Miller was an author on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was people helped Dennis in writing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but we owe a great service to him as
in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was too good of a law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too well perfected for us to be
able to really get to know the plan and
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of us, I think respected the true
intention of the law, which was to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, clear a path for people to a
have access in particular people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: in great need with, you know, any medical
issue that they could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously there was, it came, Dennis was
in the Castro area of San Francisco and
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV was a major issue at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't developed a lot of the
medicaid medications that they have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were really suffering and
also, you know, we're still dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere you look, people have cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was another, it feels like maybe
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's cause we're older, but it sure
feels like more to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that to be compassionate use,
you know, was the, the, how we,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody was framed at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, and I mean, I think it was
more than just a compassionate use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it is still is always has been a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but that was the, the cry for
common sense was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: here we got people that are going to pass
away if they, they want to ease their pain
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis instead of opiates,
instead of like, you know, all this other
[SPEAKER_00]: mind numbing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, who in the world is to tell
them that they shouldn't be able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and, and, but it really was the
way he wrote the, the initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: the voter initiative was that,
you know, any doctor can recommend that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is probably not, not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use for you, you know, and,
and I had mine for any number of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, half the time I would just wait
for the doctor to prompt something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what do you want to write it
for this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but, and I certainly did have
back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had tons of back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most of it was from hauling heavy
bags of soil into my gorilla grows miles
[SPEAKER_00]: down the end of the gorilla grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I was taking cannabis for my
cannabis, but that was an amazing time to
[SPEAKER_00]: be alive in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as anything, you know, every amazing
thing does tend to get spoiled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it, you know, everything,
yeah, everything changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing constant is change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it still is an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of jaded people,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think there's been a lot of
suffering that has happened in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, especially up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, nine late nineties were a
special time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even in genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about the diversity that we
had, you know, stuff that was in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: was different than Mendocino was different
than the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was more genetics and more
diversity, but, you know, I feel like each
[SPEAKER_01]: place had their own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe was completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, we've got this internet and
social media that has kind of like made
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis a certain way, or the way we look
at it is a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas back in the day, it wasn't about
how it looked so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, how did it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look was kind of secondary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously people, you eat with
your eyes, but I feel like some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best stuff wasn't the most beautiful
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first impression came from opening the
bag and smelling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was how I sold every pound I sold
in the late nineties, early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, look matters, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when we were kids, everything was
less homogenized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go to Oregon and get different
soda and different candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, I'm from Portland,
Oregon originally and coming to the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in the Bay area, but we would go
up there and I'd be looking forward to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the different candy when I was a little
kid, you know, six, seven, eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would go on road trips and there'd be
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis was the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd go up to Oregon and you'd get
different varieties than you would in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mendo had their own thing going
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a lot of breeding going on
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think people were breeding for
like yourself for seed stocks to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: stock alive for the next year,
the best stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there hasn't been a year since 97,
98 where I didn't make a batch of candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make a batch of seeds to have for
the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 97, 98, it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross two or three things with one male,
even by like 2001, two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started to dawn on me that I probably
should have separate places for separate
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I one of my gorillas got camped,
for those that don't know, that means
[SPEAKER_00]: helicopters come in and they take all your
all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Camp was an interesting organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it was always Humboldt State
University, the big school in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: now Cal Poly Humboldt is doing a oral
history study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the time when things are so
storied that and like back to like our
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genetics thing, like remember the
the evil company Filos, right?
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come out and say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, all of us, I think
probably, you know, we're really wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: that a mile away, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smarter than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I went to dinner with Ellen from
Filos multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were interested in working with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just knew something wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just no way it didn't make sense
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up being right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but Rob Clark he was on their
board of directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of respect for Rob and what
he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Ellen is still my friend and she's a
good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's her name is still Alicia,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even hold anything against,
you know, Mowgli either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that it was a lot of speculation
about what cannabis was going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there had taken a ton of
really close investment money,
[SPEAKER_00]: like getting money from your buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, like,
you know, no one was not as many people
[SPEAKER_00]: were interested in paying for just that
genotyping service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it was like they didn't have I
mean, it was either like screw over their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends or screw over the cannabis space
as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they chose the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we got in that situation,
what we I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too big, too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of like with great power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes great responsibility,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, but do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even believe that they ever really
had great power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still to this day that the
anecdotal list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was kind of where my point was,
was like this anecdotal list of
[SPEAKER_00]: submissions that didn't even really have
phenotypic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were doing full genome sequencing
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't, they were only looking
at like 200 snips or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like today we can look at 8,000
snips for 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my floor DNA, they do 2000 and it's
80 bucks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60, 80 bucks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they were doing was,
I mean, we came to find that out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly because like, and Rob and Mojave,
Robert Clark and Mojave, it was so wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They called me up one day and I was so
honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh my God, you know,
like Mojave, Richmond and Robert Clark
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never even met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could I have possibly done?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, how did you get that
submission that just you just called it
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck seed number?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still online.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can look this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like train wreck seed number 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like we submitted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't remember 28 17 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty sixteen probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't like super in deep with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at some point they were courting
us, they were courting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We submitted some things into the library,
you know, and to me, I always knew it was
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal, you know, like, of course,
like, and, and, and people would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, why would you submit their genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: There can, they could take them and use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, they can take them and use
them tomorrow by going to the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: in Arcata that has all of my seeds and
spending $500 and just buying one each of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm sending them dead leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a lot less dangerous than me
putting my seeds in a dispensary and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can go get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, I don't understand what
you're telling me to be scared about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were obviously there was
nefariousness involved eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Robert Clark and Mojave were
interested in is how I got the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicate of their very best saying their
sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I said, I didn't have your very
best sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I submitted a seedling that, well,
we had phenotyped it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like from seed and it was a
beautiful, we were creating a line that
[SPEAKER_00]: was most reminiscent or we were copying
train wreck in seed form is what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do, which you did a lot of that
too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had an OG Kush and a blue dream and
well, you know, to me, it just made sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had people in humble that were had
been growing for 20 years that were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we love growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love growing your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now all of a sudden, all the buyers
only want OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, why can't you just make a
seed that is OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, there's no reason why
you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back when tomatoes were the
early days of tomatoes, you couldn't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and know it was going to be a cherry
tomato or know it was going to be a slicer
[SPEAKER_00]: or know it was going to be aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to make, hey, to work that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's making homozygous seed lines or
stable or uniform, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when they said, you know,
people that have been growing in the Hills
[SPEAKER_00]: of Humble for 30 years and way older than
me, and they were my heroes and mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said like, oh man, we hate
growing from these clones that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get now if we want to stay competitive,
because the only thing people would buy is
[SPEAKER_00]: this one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just make that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the thing that triggered
Humble Seed Company to start working on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing pure bread lines and and having
uniform outcomes on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The irony, of course, and this is like
once again, back to my warning to Bayer
[SPEAKER_00]: and Syngenta out there, like it took me
about eight years to make an OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably put the name OG Kush on
that seed pack probably before I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really it did take like six to
eight generations to have the line to
[SPEAKER_00]: where like 100 percent, you know,
like we were over at Sonoma Hills and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, this is this is all like the
entire 80 plants that we planted is OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush from clone, like 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is 100 percent that it's very
difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, well, I just put OG Kush
with OG Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we're talking about recessive
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about a lot of difficult
traits to make express right in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing having a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one thing maybe you pop a bunch
of seeds and you have one or two or 10 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to make the whole progeny express OG
Kush is why there was DNA did a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: with having stuff that was very gassy and
cushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like as far as a real OG Kush in seed
form, it's it's like you can't just S1 it
[SPEAKER_01]: and expect to get the results you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing why there's no real sour diesel
seeds that are the real, real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some good BX ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some good BX four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys have some really good inbred
sour that they've been working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Karma Genetics, JJ from Top Dog,
Leo from aficionado.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get it expressed, to express across
the board is so much more difficult than
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to give it credit for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're basically like, you're selling
someone a pheno hunt where hopefully they
[SPEAKER_00]: find sour in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was not what I wanted to do with
making the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, by the time not making the
strain OG, but making seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: mimicked OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like actually if Josh G's out
there listening, like I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: if you think that we did okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like we did eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ironic part of it was that it was,
we were finished way past OG Kush being
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, so now I've got,
but now it's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think OG is going to make a comeback in
the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's already, I'm seeing it
already again in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people getting excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope sour comes back, but that one
proved to be a lot more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it was the nose on the
original sour diesel is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't even think there's many,
many of us old farts out there that even
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what that smell was, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you find it and you're
like, Oh my God, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes me back to like 1993,
you know, I was hoping to have something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the day Dave from Bud Gilero and
he's up in, you kind of, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Dave, Dave is the steward of the
sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the, he came to me Reggie on the
river.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, Hey, I got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically wanted to know what I thought of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is the real sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when I, in that moment,
I realized that all these sours had seen
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff I'd seen, you know, a lot of
people would give me sour the last couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Gassy sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the real sour had a very distinct
nose that wasn't, it was gassy and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was so complex and so citrus and so
funky, and it would burn your nostrils,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of people that are
willing to grow it or could even grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: to that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing is it's not like a
really commercially viable thing in this
[SPEAKER_00]: day and age, because unfortunately,
it's rare that people are willing to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: double to get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me, I would in a heartbeat because it
would just take me back to like even high
[SPEAKER_00]: school, you know, but definitely like the
early mid nineties is what's hard to put a
[SPEAKER_01]: price on an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like for especially for sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I just wanted I want to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's great that he has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it has a shelf life
and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for to get it to express every
time like that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, you're looking at
10 plus weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the structure isn't the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But same thing with OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard OG actually expresses
better under CMH and HPS than it does
[SPEAKER_01]: under all the new LEDs, which makes
perfect sense why a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they do grow it, they're probably not
getting the results that we're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: with OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you touched on with the whole
sour thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it's real sour, it also just
doesn't look the way that people expect
[SPEAKER_00]: buds to look these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is like, you know, to be honest,
I got to shout out to Mario Stravinsky for
[SPEAKER_00]: I always loved the way that like those,
you know, kind of like cookie crosses that
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of Gelato and Sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was really taken by how
beautiful that cannabis looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smells are great, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that set a kind of a difficult
standard for like, you know, when people
[SPEAKER_00]: are used to seeing the cannabis that looks
that kind of cool in a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: then if they were to see sour and not have
the background of of us of being like
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling it and knowing like, whoa,
this is going to have a really different
[SPEAKER_00]: effect than what you're used to and
trigger like a whole different set of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptors in your mind,
which, you know, like my business partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben and Halle and everybody, a bunch of us
went to Morocco and now I'm tanging,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like cannabis is a Pandora box of
capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we got over there and
seeing what they're growing over there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that they're growing,
just such a different animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, they want to make a
hash only.
[SPEAKER_00]: No such thing as trimmed buds at all ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you got to wash it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not wash it, but they process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the static machines are what's going to
blow up over there because it automates
[SPEAKER_01]: their process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different world over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what genetics work over there compared
to here is completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you, it wasn't a
conventional I got high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like just a totally different
feeling than what I get when I smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to spark up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what we're about to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those folks out there that think
that like THC is what you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping for or even like what the lab
said the terp and profile was or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just our science and in the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have so much respect for the folks
that are out there doing the lab work and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing the right, you know, understanding
of what cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to have to have to try it
before you pass any judgment or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, because I mean, I know a
million people that would have looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: that, what they call Bel Dia out there,
which is like the local Moroccan type
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they probably would have just been
like, I'm not even going to bother smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and would have totally missed
out on just a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: experience from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dave from Budge Laro in Ukiah,
he's a dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's great because he does long flying
varieties, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's all about long flying varieties in
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to go back in that
direction to like, how does it make you
[SPEAKER_01]: feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like with phenol hunts,
like I smoke joints with people and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, how does it taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the future for us,
especially for some of this magic is to
[SPEAKER_01]: share it with people in pre-rolls or hand
rolls to where they get to experience it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the, you know, as far as like
everyone wants convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a pen, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a joint is even better in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get to experience it for what
it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to overlook the way it
looks on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whatever, like people like the way
stuff looks, but I feel like effect is
[SPEAKER_01]: just so much more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's stuff like White Thorn Rose
has kind of taken over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Johnny, Johnny's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's been on the podcast and
really like every single podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody brings a White Thorn Rose and
it's feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stuff that makes you feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, it's not,
you can't categorize it as Indica or
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your typical run of the mill
thing, but it's one of those things that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you feel amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's a lot like our
blueberry muffin strain, which has always
[SPEAKER_00]: been just like, to me, the most comforting
cannabis high that, that you I've ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and Johnny's White Thorn
Rose, I like, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and a lot of these things,
what I try to remind people is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, when you're swimming in different
weed all around you all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have a million jars of strains and
things that you can try from, and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't, you're not just after getting
as high as you can quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like what we see with people
going after like, you know, just walking
[SPEAKER_00]: into a dispensary and being like,
what's your highest CHC thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, I don't know this for
sure, but I could easily imagine when
[SPEAKER_00]: people, when they stopped prohibiting
alcohol in the U S that people probably
[SPEAKER_00]: were like, I mean, during prohibition,
for example, people for sure only were
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking hard stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or only moving hard stuff around
the heart of the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you're hiding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, I'm sure, you know, in the first
time during legalization of, of alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: that people probably, it probably took a
long time for fine wine to really make it
[SPEAKER_00]: come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like government made it
difficult too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they made it extremely difficult,
but, but Bacardi 151 is not the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: seller in the liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think the strongest cannabis
is going to be like that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the strongest selling thing
in, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know anybody that drinks
one 51 or ever clear, but it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like if you're, if you're like,
you know, only if you're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve one goal, which is to just
inebriate, inebriate yourself and forget
[SPEAKER_01]: about your young people, maybe they like
long Island STS, you know, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but yeah, I think most of us,
the more sophisticated, the more your
[SPEAKER_01]: palette becomes educated, the less you're
worried about the THC percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry muffins, a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping to have samples for you today
because I feel like those clones are kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the finished flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I told the story on the podcast
with Hallie, but I got blueberry muffin on
[SPEAKER_01]: accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to buy a clone of DJ shorts,
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew it out and I'm like, this isn't it,
but this is pretty freaking special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out it was blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody always assumes that we made it
out of DJ shorts, blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's no, and we didn't have
anything to do with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as, you know, like it's funny,
cause my wife who just dropped me off was
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very close to DJ short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was just like, he's going to want
to kick your butt if you name a stream,
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry muffin, hon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, and, and then we actually
met up with DJ short and he was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No fucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't name that anything else though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it smells exactly like a
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what frustrates me with names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when somebody takes a name and then
you have something that's that fits that
[SPEAKER_01]: description better because all the names
are kind of taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't name something apple
crisp or apple pie because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably five apple pies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if yours smells more like apple pie
chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's taken yet,
but I've seen some Kung Pao chicken turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hallie found this bizarre turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing a big, big hunt and she
finds this one and she's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: This smells like a soul, like salami,
like spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, who in the world,
like would even want cannabis that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like salami?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we did try to get, we got a cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Italians, Italians, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, the, this plant is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a little like factoid that,
you know, you, you probably know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you wrote the book on the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always reiterate this one though,
because I, I think it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is like one of 6% of the plant
kingdom that does not screw itself on the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular or is unlikely to screw itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, because it has a male and a
female on two separate plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 94%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like us for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a easiest versus money issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, genetically that leads to
the potential for a lot more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic paths to, you know, divergence or
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cannabis is like connection to
humanity, which I feel like is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it makes sense that we have all of
these different turpent profiles and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, all these other amazing
things that we're discovering beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: turbines that are just as important or
more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then even the most important
thing is just at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does to you when you consume it
or, and how, you know, it's medicinal for
[SPEAKER_00]: us as people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therapeutic for us as people and,
and fricking, you know, salami smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you know, I, I wouldn't want it
to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all the options we can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different colors, you know,
if you're a painter, the more colors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salami.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother's Magnolia out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have beef stew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like that meat breath strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some interesting ones,
but I'm ready to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh, I got, we're talking about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we come back, we've been
experimenting with some pepper breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and making a little hobby hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're goofing around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, I make it with my kids
because I can't go and, and like do as
[SPEAKER_00]: much cannabis stuff with my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I just made some, uh, some jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's tap into these joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some, uh, the dirt skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke with Hallie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's only fair to smoke it with
you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this stuff is really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it got you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were lit on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles normally doesn't, I mean,
skills gets me feeling great, but as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as like, I smoke some stronger stuff to
feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to get that effect in this
stuff, for whatever reason, we did this
[SPEAKER_01]: soil versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my buddies SF Kana did a trial in a
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only variable they changed,
which is the way you do a real trial is to
[SPEAKER_01]: trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change one variable and they, uh,
use soil versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really enjoy the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is dirty skittles, dirty skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's like, I love cocoa too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no, no problem with, I use Rockwell
for my mom's and we do for, for clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use Rockwell, Stonewall.
Grotan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to my friends over at Grotan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, there's something special
about soil and especially for flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think soil always looks
necessarily the best, but as far as effect
[SPEAKER_01]: and flavor, you get different expressions,
regardless of what you use for substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different soil versus cocoa versus
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting different effect,
different expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So true.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the beauty of the plant,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and it's like not just genetics
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things come into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terroir as they would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environment and nutrition dictate
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if we're talking about chemo
types, that can be a whole nother thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can have, I think those
things play into that a little bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the genotypes, they stay the
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're what epigenetic changes
can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started talking about genetic drift
that we go down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then epigenetic changes and then how
tissue culture can play a part in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be really good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to knock the rings through the
rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could knock the rings through the rings
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it like, then all of the vape
people were like experts, wizards at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was kind of like, oh man,
these are ruined it for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like drawings in the air with
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how things evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back when like Texas Hold'em was
really big, you know, and all my friends
[SPEAKER_00]: would always, and I liked playing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't like super into it, but I like
going for the social aspect of sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around with a bunch of buddies and playing
a game, a Hold'em or a tourney or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just be like, so thick, the room would
be so thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could cut the smoke, you know,
and just all of us just playing around
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rings across the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got good at it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vaporizer ruined it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporizing, you know, it's just,
it's gone in an interesting direction and
[SPEAKER_01]: it keeps getting more interesting and
evolves further and further and further
[SPEAKER_01]: like the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden we've got these
electric, you know, dab devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not like against it,
but it just wasn't the same as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm happy that I love I'll never
stop smoking weed through a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I feel like that's the best way to
identify the flaws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you know, whether it's in the genetics
or whether it's with the cultivation of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's easier to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like simple to have flavors express
well in, you know, rosin or live resin or
[SPEAKER_00]: vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not as easy because I've had
some terrible vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joints is like the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought of it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I enjoy smoking a good joint and
also like how far down does it still taste
[SPEAKER_01]: good?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you relight it, does it taste good
when you light it up the next day?
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does the flavor change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some stuff it smells great in there
or smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to light it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes even off the first hit
purple punch, this is my, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about it a lot on the show,
but it's a big letdown for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like it's a beautiful looking
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a cultivator's perspective,
purple punch is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the rosin and the extract is
decent, but the joint, when you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint and a lot of stuff that's bread with
it has this too, where you light it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: then all of a sudden you're like,
where's the chirps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chirps are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, and that's, that goes to
like what we've been talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, as far as Bayer and all these
companies that want to look at stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are like,
well, let's just breed with the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot just breed with the data
because it's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on paper, a lot of stuff looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even on Instagram, a lot of stuff
looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, you know, so we get,
we get all this variation that is very
[SPEAKER_01]: subjective to the individual and take
somebody who knows what they're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about to go through, knows what they're
looking at, smoking, smelling,
[SPEAKER_01]: tasting, experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seasoned cannabis, veterans sitting here
talking about how important it is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: seasoned cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but there's, it's like undeniable that
it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when some of these kids learn real
quick, I've seen some of these younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, like they're like, oh, well I like
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this stuff and I don't like this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they develop a palette really quickly,
but it's also data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you come from a science
background, I'm a chef, but have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, the more data points you
have, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so experiencing it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more times you've tried it,
you have a better idea of what you like
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you don't like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, if you have,
you know, a year of experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't really add up to having a
complete palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with outdoor, it's like every
year is a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you grow the same thing outdoors
every year, it's slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to experience it multiple
years to fully understand that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people ask us a lot, you as well,
I'm sure about, you know, what can I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: this year that will finish at this certain
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or has the resistance to PMB, Petritis,
whatever it is, you know, that got them
[SPEAKER_00]: the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, the Septoria was never
really a thing for anybody in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not traditionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been really surprised to see it so
often lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's almost like a more
dangerous monster than the Hop Layton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, Septoria is gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a whole other topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what we were talking about was the
reactionary overcorrect that happens so
[SPEAKER_00]: often in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nobody's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever fault a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how many years did I have it just dump
rain in, you know, on October 10 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: like two days later, it was 85 again
outside and everything just molded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year I just was like,
I'm not growing anything that finishes
[SPEAKER_00]: later than this certain day when the stuff
molded or whatever it happened last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year it dumps September
20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, all the stuff that, you know,
I'm only growing auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was like you'd always have a
still a couple ones that were the late
[SPEAKER_00]: ones because you had to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones would just be beautiful and
totally clean, even though they got rained
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they might get crushed by rain,
but they don't get any botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get any PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like did them good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, man, they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's exactly what you were saying was
sort of like having not all your eggs in
[SPEAKER_00]: one basket or not all your terps in one
genre and all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Data driven breeding towards some of these
goals like we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beautiful thing about coastal
environments like up in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can really test for botrytis and PM
resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from one ridge to the next,
as we had Johnny and Jason talk about from
[SPEAKER_01]: Huckleberry and Ridgeline, it's like the
plant will express differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all these different variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with microclimates, you don't know
exactly how the plant's going to perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that gets us into another
interesting conversation, which is land
[SPEAKER_01]: race preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're doing some land race
preservation, working with land race
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business owner Ben has been doing
really cool stuff down because you just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, I think we were off camera,
but Saint Vincent and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys donated 10,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I donated 30,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys did great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, props to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Big Mike's donated some seeds as well
from advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's people that are
willing to give back and people to share
[SPEAKER_01]: and not expecting anything in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's real cannabis culture right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I'm sure my daughter talked all
about the $1,700 pies auctions for the
[SPEAKER_00]: elementary school and paying $1,700 for a
Blackberry pie so that the school gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a field trip again this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a time when people
grumbled a lot about the Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those dope growers just,
they don't pay taxes on it and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a lot of taxing happening,
self-taxing, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changed so much in Humboldt,
the economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate actually what you said about
one of the hardest hit places because it
[SPEAKER_00]: really was as a county, whatever you want
to call it, the whole Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a community, as a county, whatever,
however you want to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to put it, we were so-
We're here because of Humboldt in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were so dependent on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how much some of our
county officials and these aren't even
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are far removed from the
culture and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have definitely county supervisors,
for example, who are total supporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not partakers in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't even, I think,
have any idea how much a town like
[SPEAKER_00]: Garberville was dependent on the economy
of- The cannabis economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it was pre-recreational,
legalization, or post, that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: those taxes because self-taxes were
staying right there and helping the
[SPEAKER_00]: schools, helping fire departments,
helping all of these public services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then not to mention tons of money spent at
small business that thrived in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had the highest concentration
of nonprofit groups in the entire United
[SPEAKER_00]: States in Humboldt County for a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's still that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably is for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's just no way that folks
like Jason and Johnny, and for that
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, people that are even a lot less
well-known cultivators out in the hills of
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt could ever even be asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've had to cancel our county
acreage or square foot tax for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: five years, four or five years,
which a lot of us growers wanted to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were more than willing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't a lot of argument from
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is on a long-lives environmental
group and worked there for close to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put all the tree sits and Woody
Harrelson up locking himself to the Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Gate Bridge to protect Redwoods and Bonnie
Raitt planting the concert every single
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her great story is how many times someone
would just come into the office where a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that was coordinated from and just
drop off a nondescript brown paper bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No names, no nothing out the door,
but it was like big sacks of cash to help
[SPEAKER_00]: do this pro bono.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the thriving cannabis economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the thriving cannabis economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying it has to go back to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in taxes and I believe in the
local government and the way that things
[SPEAKER_00]: have worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one knew how difficult it was going
to be made by onerous regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were also a lot of promises that
weren't kept, like namely one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest arguments for the Prop 64 that was
within the space that we were in,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the growing community,
which we had the most to gain or lose
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we could lose like the way that we
interacted for many years with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for probably if you were like me,
for the most part, the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: interacted economically, although,
you know, like I always had a job with
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, doing salmon biology stuff,
but that wasn't really just to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: paying all the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a music teacher for a short
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a local school, not like a real
accredited, but that was just another way
[SPEAKER_00]: to put some money in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis put- Cannabis put the food on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the food on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it allowed, you know,
I look at the generation that's coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and I can understand why people
are, there's a lot of like, feels like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of unrest in their country because I
just don't feel like there's equity and
[SPEAKER_00]: like being able to own land or own a home
is just so out of reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it feels that way, at least for so
many people that are young that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if I was young right now,
I'm, that might be, you know, a passion
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would follow would be trying to
create more, more equity at the time when
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out West and even before I moved
out West, I had, I was sort of impassioned
[SPEAKER_00]: about nature and, and then I still am of
course, but people got to live too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got on another tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, that, that's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the dirty Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got good turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, I mean, you can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that say they don't like Skittles
have not tasted this because it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like cannabis and you like candy,
it's pretty candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think people that say that they
don't like Skittles probably have tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it because it's not, it's a pain in
the neck to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody would argue with
me on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When breeding, breeding with Skittles,
you can find the Skittles expressions
[SPEAKER_01]: really easily because they're the ones
that grow the shittiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones that look ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can spot them typically with my crosses
and I've done a bunch of work with
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles trying to tease out the Skittles
turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the ones that are real Skittly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all look like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wimpy and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to beat up any strain
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, I, we've definitely got like,
we have a strain we call hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's half Skittles, half blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not that different really,
but, but blueberry muffin is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest things there is that I it's like
beginner bud, you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that, but it's, it's great if,
if you've never tried any to grow before,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it doesn't get and have a lot of
those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry muffin is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about that for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think the genetic lineage
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, blueberry muffin to them
Skittle, but it, but we cross it with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and blueberry muffin really came from a
day that I know a time that I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: you remember as well, where strains that
had names on them were a lot more rare
[SPEAKER_00]: than just seeds that you got from the
community that were just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and there were certainly plenty of
things that, that had names and came to us
[SPEAKER_00]: in that form with like, you know,
this is grand daddy perps or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that was an old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know, like just,
but more often than not the, our source
[SPEAKER_00]: material for breeding at that time in the
early nineties was not like anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: had a name, especially, you know,
in a place like Humboldt, where there was
[SPEAKER_00]: so much genetics kind of ended up coming
there because so many people were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, blueberry muffin was,
was really like a strain that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that were matanuskin supposedly that
I had gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a good batch of seed that's
from Oregon that we called the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: grape that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Oregon blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an interesting, it was a spear like
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't anything related to DJ short,
short Indica plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Oregon had some good genetics
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blackberry Kush from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that was an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like a CBD variety before we had
CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't ever a huge fan of that one,
but some of them were just, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and then there was that, uh,
the rats and, and so the blueberry muffin
[SPEAKER_00]: did have all of those things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the first thing that I ever actually
had ended up creating a moniker strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name for, um, out of the encouraging
people over at, um, purple heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which is straight up the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they were so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this one buyer in there and
remember you'd go down in that basement
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, you know, that was where you
were allowed to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were either selling or a part of
the management or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought it was so cool to get
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and she said, you know, this is just
so unique and special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really just think you, you ought to
name this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and why don't you, you should just
start calling the strain purple passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have the seeds, like somewhat
uniforms stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So called it purple passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it led to me writing a little bit for
Oakstradam news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that little news newspaper that
ended up when Oakstradam was at its sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of, um, I mean, that was like the
beginning of harborside and right,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, I can't believe that they just,
now they're like getting shut down or
[SPEAKER_00]: receivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like, they basically out of business
ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they went to state line and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve and Andrew were long gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've been on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just were at their anniversary reunion,
which was great in Oakland and rooted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the five 10.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, interesting story, uh,
about the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Jimmy Myers from GDP, the GDP,
the guy, how GDP got his name was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, at the third floor, they, he didn't
care what it was called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, they want to call it
granddaddy perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where the name granddaddy
purple came from originally, regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other stories from all the other
people that, that was the original name
[SPEAKER_01]: from his stuff that he had gotten the cut
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just a steward, like a lot of us,
um, with special cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then she said that I wrote about it
under the pseudonym, uh, cause back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, it was not people don't, don't
realize, like, even though it was
[SPEAKER_00]: medically legal, you were still taking a
big risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, I've talked a little
bit about my days as a gorilla grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your pseudonym?
[SPEAKER_00]: My pseudonym was, uh, there was a
president of Humboldt state university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always thought his name was just
kind of super sort of snooty sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his name was Rollin Richmond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, I'm Sir Rollin
Richmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better than GW Kush or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call myself, uh, Rollin like looked
like Rollin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just went with a Rollin,
a, and then the last name was big old bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: big, big old Rollin and big old Rollin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big old bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, I think even like Google and
find some of the articles, but nice purple
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was probably like 2000,
you know, two or three or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when the Oxford am news was
in circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the purple passion turned into a
strain that is now an acronym on our
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a strain in it just so it
happened that there was a party at the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, the next morning,
right by the one of the, an offshoot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the purple passion that was like just
beautiful, dark purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some panties at the base because
somebody had had a really great night that
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, turned into purple panties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so that's why I called it the
purple panty dropper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was like, you know, imagine that I
knew exactly who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember seeing a strain called the
flower purple panty dropper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that was the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that was, that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and then I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't actually talked to Mario about
it because the Sherbinski has that pink
[SPEAKER_00]: panties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe his pink panties,
um, that was sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what made the sunset Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe I can't even remember what
the cross from that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, you know, we were all that in
that day, you just didn't even like want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you said where you got
something from, it was like, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about tomatoes that they grow shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't say you were growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were like, I want to get bigger yields
for my tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, wild times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Humboldt seed company seed packs
were little business cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the local place up in Humboldt were
like, yeah, we'll print business cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, you print weed pictures
and stream names on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, let's grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, then I would just like put the
little seed vile, ironically, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: vile that we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a little bit of shrink wrap,
you know, and that was, it was not fancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the time it was way fancy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would bring those down from LA
to, um, back to Humboldt, just dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: off tons and tons of seed packs,
those little seed packs everywhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: never getting paid a dime, um,
upfront, always like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were, they were like, well,
this is something new to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and a lot of the time too,
it was great because it would help me get,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least get the two 15 flower that I was
growing sold because more often than not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, how do you get in the door to
get down into the special buyer's room?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause there were, you know,
a lot of people were jumped on that and
[SPEAKER_01]: even though vendors, yeah, lots of
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though a lot of it didn't stay
here in California, you were pumped if it
[SPEAKER_00]: did, you know, like you wanted it,
like that was the target was to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: service the legitimate medicinal cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you were doing it that way,
it felt like a little bit like it was more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable and, and like you had done a good
job or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like always something that I
enjoyed getting to go into those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then yeah, consignment seed packs and
come back six months later and just see if
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll honor, you know, like see if they
had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that was the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blueberry muffin came out of
the PPD, which is what we call the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: painted rapper now with the Raz,
the razzleberry, but then, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the razzleberry was a cut that I got
from, um, up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so let's circle back to the Caribbean
and it's kind of some of the stuff you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think you're working with other
islands in the Caribbean besides just St.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard he's been on here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's been doing a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another kid not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I've been a little bit more the
let's hold it down at home, which is also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I always say too,
you gotta just keep your head down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and breed, breed, breed, breed,
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there were so many
people that said, well, you'll never be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive as like a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the people that laughed at me
back in the day, it's like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believed in it and I wasn't taken no for
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've believed in this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally had people laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friends thought it was so funny
that, you know, it's like there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was guys in high times doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why couldn't I be that guy or why couldn't
I do that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be a jerk, but a lot of
them are, but they didn't follow their
[SPEAKER_00]: dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whatever they did, most of the,
most people don't, you know, and I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm fortunate enough to have followed
my dreams that led me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are always like, Oh my God,
you get the dream job and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other, it is tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievably difficult doing what we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work my ass off all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want the, it's hard on
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I feel like people, they see it
and they're like, well, they want the
[SPEAKER_01]: glamorous side of it, but they don't
realize the hard work that it took to get
[SPEAKER_01]: there and all the sleepless nights and
people laughing at you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one great question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could have one piece of advice to
share with your younger self or your
[SPEAKER_01]: younger colleagues, what would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really tough question because
what we were just talking about was like
[SPEAKER_00]: how we, our passions turned into,
you know, hopefully successful business is
[SPEAKER_00]: currently successful, let's just say,
but some sort of legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I'd love to be able to just be
like, you know, do what you love and the
[SPEAKER_00]: money will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so sure that we live in that world
as much as we used to, but I still think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely worth a try and you can
devote, you know, even if it takes you
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five years before you really think
that it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not making money,
I think that you said the word devote and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think devotional is the key to all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can devote yourself to the,
whatever it is that you want to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you want to be a musician,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be a priest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can be devotional and devote
yourself to that thing, like I have with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and you have with cannabis,
I think anything is possible, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to just eat, sleep and
breathe it, live it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever you do, you get back in
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that to answer your question with like
utmost caution, cause I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: steer anybody the wrong way, but you have
to, you have to try and otherwise you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, there was a turning point where
I was like, if I don't give this my all,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little while, I will always wonder
whether it could have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am so thankful that for that like
willingness, but I also wasn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like living, like I had a little
bit of a savings and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, not a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had like an economic cushion in
my world at all, but maybe enough to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through, you know, a few three,
two, three seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So months and also like once getting the
little first piece of land that I got in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County, just like, well,
Hey, I've got a daughter, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: she probably told you, she like went,
was on my back in a back, baby backpack,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to build out the first of my gorilla
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never brought her after the plants
were there, but I was risk adverse at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time because of that precious little you
know, person that now was, I felt very
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, yeah, with the utmost
caution, depending on your life
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances, try your best to get a
little cushion, whether that's working at
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's and then going home and
hustling seeds online or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always had two jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had a legit job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my, my job that I would dream
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate enough to be able to
have a dream job and then another less
[SPEAKER_00]: legit dream job with the salmon stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was only just cause where it was,
where I was being in the kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you're living the dream here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is an amazing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact that you're bringing,
you know, like all of these people
[SPEAKER_00]: together on the podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the book, man, I mean,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm buying a copy, putting it right in our
offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you gave Hallie one already,
but I feel like I got one for you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one for you too, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, I'd love the, I want to help
cause it, you know, all of us small
[SPEAKER_00]: business folks, we know, you know,
we got a, we're like always looking out
[SPEAKER_00]: for each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to work with other small businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should talk about some collaboration on
some level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty of this community and the
beauty of doing podcasts like this is that
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to know people better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like how I talk about how LEDs
sucked back in the day with the blurples
[SPEAKER_01]: and then somebody figures out how to
improve them and make them better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminized seeds suck back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty much the standard now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I used to say Feminized seeds
sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the guilt of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I learned and I also said
autofire suck, but also like Humboldt seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are doing cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met a lot of people that work with
you and you know, it's like, so it's great
[SPEAKER_01]: connecting with you on this level and
interviewing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people are looking to find out more
about you and your company, where can they
[SPEAKER_01]: go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go to our website,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're have, we have like this relationship
with the local native American tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has given us in one way or another,
the ability to just sort of kind of spread
[SPEAKER_00]: our wings more as far as people being able
to like order our seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think it's totally,
seeds are hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds when they are seeds are hemp because
the definition of hemp is anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything below 0.3% THC in the United
States is considered hemp and seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp until they changed the farm bill
saying otherwise, which I doubt they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do because you know, back in the
day there was like the source where you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew it, but it's not like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane Pennington, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he was all of our hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because we have the same
last name and everybody always asks me is
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane Pennington, but I'll tell you what I
call him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called him the day after that,
after he published the response from the
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you are my hero because
it's on my website too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're watching the plant become
just more accessible and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and normalized and normalized,
which I think is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not just for our businesses,
but I think it's a great thing because the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant does more good than bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think it makes the world a
better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like, as a chef, I'm sure that
you also got to understand that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, there's no better way to really know
what you like when it comes to an eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: Benedict, then the cooking eggs Benedict
five or six times and screw up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and try it with paprika or no paprika
or Canadian bacon or real bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that, I feel that is the same
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked a lot during this
conversation about what makes cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel like, you know,
having more options of cannabis at your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingertips makes for good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's the situational bottleneck
ourselves into gelato or into these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we lose a bunch of the other
colors along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Kevin Jodry talked about it
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he has a really good point
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we breed towards these certain goals
where we think this is what we want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then we lose all these other things
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the diversity is what makes
it so special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also how you introduce hybrid vigor back
into the plant is diversity.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, Kevin is like a hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been a little bit of like sky
that I've looked up to and a mentor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll tell you this, like someone like
Kevin as he was a mentor to guys like us
[SPEAKER_00]: who were probably mentors to other people
out there that are watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wouldn't have said that as in,
as articulately as he said it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I watched that recent thing he did
about 10 years ago, it was more like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all just got to grow these commercial
things because we all got to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we survive through this, which he was
right about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it takes so much seasoning of
being in the space to start for all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to really like dawn on you where
you're like, diversity is unbelievably
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is important to your seed business
is important to my seed business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to every grower out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just don't even know how
critical it is to having both like really
[SPEAKER_00]: good cannabis available and really
effective cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also to like having a good
business model for this plant that is like
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to Syngenta and resistant to
pear because there's subjectivity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people want that diversity
desperately and need it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am so glad that that's the case
because I think it's a bright future for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks like us that have spent decades and
lifetimes really diving into the beauty
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant, the wealth of diversity
and what it has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to do this again up at your
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring some clones up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some crosses that I think you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so great that you're working with
the muffin and let's do something this
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll float down the freshly undammed
Klamath River too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a hot thing this
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would absolutely be honored to have
you come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, thanks again for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like we connected right away like
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're easy to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't plan on it, but it's a fun hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling the bottles for $1,000 a
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
