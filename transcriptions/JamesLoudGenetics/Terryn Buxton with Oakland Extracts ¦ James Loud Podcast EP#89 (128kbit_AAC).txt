[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: and today our special guest Is Taryn
Buxton from Oakland extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm glad you're here too,
man I met you a few weeks ago Like it
[SPEAKER_02]: seems like a few weeks, but it was a
little over a month ago over the the
[SPEAKER_02]: harborside reunion party great event You
know a lot of great people came coming
[SPEAKER_02]: together for a great cause and yeah,
yeah High school reunion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's wild, you know and seeing some
people that I had no idea that we're even
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be there You know, cuz I'm as an
outsider.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a vendor You know knowing Steve and
Andrew pretty well doing some filming with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, especially over the last couple
years They're great guys and then
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that works at harborside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very family oriented company
Yeah, it was a beautiful space to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky to be there Early when they
opened I worked there from 09 to 2012 And
[SPEAKER_01]: so I got to know a lot of the original
staff there First opened the store and
[SPEAKER_01]: just when the staff is a little bit
smaller as it was starting to grow Those
[SPEAKER_02]: were the best years to you in my opinion
Those were the best years of harborside
[SPEAKER_02]: going there as a consumer going there as a
vendor Someone who went there to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the best clones like literally
they set the standard for clones the same
[SPEAKER_02]: standard that we have today was set at
harborside back then and The world had
[SPEAKER_02]: never seen anything quite like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes There was you know, there was clone
vending going on before harborside.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's clone vending going on now But
right, you know when they when they
[SPEAKER_02]: brought out we had Dan grace Who really
rocked him out from Dark Heart nursery,
[SPEAKER_02]: man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really killing it on a whole nother
level and you know scaling and as they
[SPEAKER_02]: scaled They maintain quality and very even
clones, you know, I haven't seen very many
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that have Competed with those
kind of clones even today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't I mean I'm not as in touch
with the clone market as I used to be but
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never seen the clone company grow to
that scale that size that but well branded
[SPEAKER_01]: and still people came back loving the cuts
even years into them being popular a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of brands will kind of get big and the
quality kind of starts to waver as they
[SPEAKER_01]: scale up and they always maintain that
quality so I feel like at the end they had
[SPEAKER_02]: problems it Hoplite and v-raid was a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that really I think affected them
more than anybody that I've ever seen But
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, and as you scale it gets difficult
and the scale that they went to was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: phenomenal from being a small mom and pop
company absolutely and then just growing
[SPEAKER_02]: and then providing good genetics and I
feel like They were very they had good
[SPEAKER_02]: integrity with the genetics the names the
genetics everything was tested They
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't just throwing stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we really liked working with them when
I was there There's a lot of the there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of small clone companies are kind of
popping up out of nowhere Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you really couldn't trust worth
the genetics where they said it was one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing but as often something else Oh,
yeah, and Darkheart you really cut
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could you could really trust
what they were doing and just that era I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I remember before there really was a
clone department at harborside and then
[SPEAKER_01]: once there was and once it got rocking I
mean there'd be a line when it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: season the light there's a line outside
the door two hours before we open that was
[SPEAKER_01]: down the block and that line existed until
we were closed and there's still a line
[SPEAKER_01]: out the door well after we were closed
people coming and getting those clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were selling them by the truck full
yeah, just you know, it was funny cuz you
[SPEAKER_02]: Would go you would go online and I believe
it was Twitter back in the day You know
[SPEAKER_02]: when Twitter first became a thing you
would go and get the menu and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: you could get what you wanted to get there
It was like published the day before,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know The day of or the day before and
you go there and get in line and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: it was there Maybe it was maybe it wasn't
yeah, but there was always a diverse menu
[SPEAKER_02]: too of all kinds of good stuff You know
and it really impressive, you know looking
[SPEAKER_02]: back Looking in hindsight, you know the
stuff that the Dispensaries went to to get
[SPEAKER_02]: to the points where the places they're at
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was beautiful working there
because before they're most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries They're a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a lot darker security was kind of big
scowling guys up front and just the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: Experience it kind of felt like going to a
used record store if you didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know the cool thing You kind of got a
certain kind of vibe from people whereas
[SPEAKER_01]: harborside all the security they refer the
security of safety It was wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful It was well lit and it
was very welcoming and inviting for people
[SPEAKER_01]: who weren't necessarily from the cannabis
community and they really made a point as
[SPEAKER_01]: a Someone who worked there that you had to
be smiling all day if one of the managers
[SPEAKER_01]: walked through and then saw you not
Smiling they jumped on you because they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want you just sitting there looking
stone They wanted you to look aware and
[SPEAKER_01]: engaged So when someone came up to you
talking about cancer or talking about some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of issue They had you weren't just
some stone kid in the back They really
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and make it clear that this was
about medical about servicing the
[SPEAKER_02]: community Yeah, it was cool and they they
had a lot of money to Yeah harborside was
[SPEAKER_02]: very successful so they had massages and
they had programs and they had You know
[SPEAKER_02]: classes and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a lot of money on that even When
they weren't making money that was always
[SPEAKER_01]: a priority of them to make sure that
there's free health services available to
[SPEAKER_01]: the community And that was something that
no matter what there was going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: them financially They always maintained
through all the lawsuits with the feds
[SPEAKER_01]: through the tax bills that came in They
always make sure and all those people were
[SPEAKER_01]: paid by harborside.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people weren't just giving it away
for free So it was really beautiful thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that they committed to yeah They had a big
target on their backs being the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: and being the first to do what they did
and then to scale People wanted to make an
[SPEAKER_02]: example of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were always in court.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always someone trying to come up
Yeah, our monthly staff meetings were just
[SPEAKER_01]: court updates usually what's going on with
this case this feds might come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: different Trainings for the cops coming in
the feds coming in how that might look
[SPEAKER_01]: different and it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So how did you get your start in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a consumer, you know, I love the plant
grew up loving the plant all through high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and in college I was always a big
big fan of the plant as a big part of my
[SPEAKER_01]: life and I kind of inadvertently started
growing a friend of mine was started had
[SPEAKER_01]: it had a little grow at his house and I
Would just kind of help him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had helped me out on a project
previously So I kind of owed him a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of labor and then so I started helping
help them build out his grow Hope take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of his plants and didn't realize I
had a green thumb before them and like
[SPEAKER_01]: really got into taking care of the plants
and all this time I was working in
[SPEAKER_01]: different nonprofit organization So I had
her kind of a square day job and then
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this in the evening I really really
got into it and I got so into it I wound
[SPEAKER_01]: up having my own grow at my house and then
I stopped working in nonprofits and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just growing and I lived right near
harborside Nice and I would I would go by
[SPEAKER_01]: there like every other day Right before
closing just to kind of come in get a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: But really just to hang out and shoot the
shit because when you're growing it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: very insular activity I'm by myself in the
basement all hours of the night And so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just kind of nice to go there to hang
out and they just started joking like you
[SPEAKER_01]: come here So often you should just work
here and I mean I'm honestly I got more
[SPEAKER_01]: good advice About growing from the people
that work there than even the original
[SPEAKER_01]: people that kind of put me on to growing
and so it's just a great knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and I had the time and so I just
started working there kind of for fun when
[SPEAKER_02]: so many good growers going in there and
vendors to like The quality of the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: there was really amazing flower Diverse,
you know, there was something for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like there was only top shelf
There was top shelf and there was the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom and there was stuff that was
affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good You know and good healthy
clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was always the agenda was to
have good healthy clean medicine Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the focus a record the original
buyer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like really really strong on that
before we had any kind of Lab testing they
[SPEAKER_01]: were very clear about what kind of growing
practices they wanted to see the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: have and as A vendor before I started
working there people would be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: vending room They're getting their hearts
broken because everyone thinks they just
[SPEAKER_01]: have the most beautiful plants and they go
back there Oh, and they would get it They
[SPEAKER_01]: would get long explanations of what they
can do better next time and you see people
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out just crestfallen But it just
increased the amount of effort energy put
[SPEAKER_01]: in towards their plants and making it
better They just improve the quality for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your favorite flower from back
in the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know mine I mean, there's so many we had
a cut of super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that Steve Insisted was not super
silver haze because it smelled nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: like haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like stop calling it super silver
haze He got really mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came in one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He smelled it and he's and he went off and
he's like just call it super silver It's
[SPEAKER_01]: too cheesy and we're like the staff were
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what you're talking about
This is just the best sativa ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used to love that was that 97 cut
Yeah, I believe it was that 97 kept it was
[SPEAKER_02]: extra funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't as turpinoline dominant or
turpinoline dominant Yeah, I used to love
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the old-school since he star.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes It was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I miss real Indica's that Tasted
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what they tested at but like
like Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Romulan Romulan Romulan and pure
Afghani Everything before the perps took
[SPEAKER_01]: over there was a lot I felt like there's a
lot of more variety with around the
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica's and it was really interesting You
could really feel them then when purple
[SPEAKER_01]: started to dominate that everyone kind of
went that there was a purple Kush that was
[SPEAKER_01]: out for a while I like the old one when it
was ugly little nugs that were just dense
[SPEAKER_01]: and they actually did something to you as
opposed to whatever came out later that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think Was just another version of grape
ape.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just look good, but didn't really do
much Yeah, purples used to actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: an impact and then they started these kind
of strong Yeah, there was some strong ones
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then then there was like the
blackberry Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like the weakest of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like CBD We didn't even test it
back in the day, but I'm pretty sure it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be super high in CBD and super low
in THC Yeah, I missed a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah and all the different long
flowering varieties You know, it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: there was some really special stuff power
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like back in the day,
but I like now I was always a big fan of a
[SPEAKER_01]: red Congo still am but I Like red Congo
more than than I do now and then I like
[SPEAKER_02]: red Congo more than the Durbin and more
than the Malawi Although I'd like all
[SPEAKER_02]: three of those a lot The red Congo makes
me like laugh and smile and the Durbin
[SPEAKER_02]: just takes me out same thing with the
Malawi is one of those ones in small doses
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you can overdo it with that one
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really gotta be climbing the walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my favorite my favorite thing at
harborside back in the day was the sage
[SPEAKER_02]: and sour I believe it was from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my friends were growing that For a
long time so I got really close with that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant That was one of the original plants
that we started extracting when we started
[SPEAKER_01]: oak and extracts That was that was
phenomenal and say it's just hard this
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all indoor organic soil Soil
grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was the best that was that in
my opinion That was the best thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: came out of harborside the chem 91 was
really good to the you know There was a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of amazing amazing things that came
out of that era but that sage and sour was
[SPEAKER_02]: something special because it was like Like
sour it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you liked haze, it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just check so many boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gassy It was it was really
nose-burning pungent and the structure was
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a lot of structure to it I miss the
same crew that that worked with the sage
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't create the sage But they had
the sage for a long time at harborside
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a cow cushion with strawberry
cough and there was a couple runs of that
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best smoke I've ever had in
my life where it was like just psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so amazing But it was interesting
about growing is like they had the cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: cut didn't change But it was really just
they it was great for like a year and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half and then it kind of whatever it
happened It kind of deteriorated or their
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to get the most out of it changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it just was just never the same
Yeah, I like strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like blue dream is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, like blue dream is
very functional But then strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_02]: is a stronger blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it turned it's like blue dream
turnt up Yeah, it was a big fan a big fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah good stuff I mean, yeah, I love
talking about genetics from the back Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's stuff that I haven't heard of
in a long time and somebody brings it up
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, wow I remember that that was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just miss basic stuff like UK cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I Don't understand why that's
still not around that was loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around you just have to know the
right people Nicky T has some but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: common to see cheese right like cheese or
even like Strong cheese derivatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I you know, there are some of these chemi
things They're like so I smell an extracts
[SPEAKER_02]: to like when you're smelling rosin You're
like you that smells cheesy and people
[SPEAKER_02]: like I don't know that smells like the
cheese the strain, you know, I mean real
[SPEAKER_02]: UK or Exodus cheese, that's phenomenal I
just missed the variety like I did like I
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean gelato is cool Yeah, you know all
this all what's happening now is cool But
[SPEAKER_01]: I just miss a variety that we used to have
and then there was just so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's so many different Types of
strange strains coming from some different
[SPEAKER_01]: mom-and-pop grows Yeah, and these are the
best I've ever smoked in my life or coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from people that had like two four six
eight lights I mean literally those the
[SPEAKER_02]: best yeah all the crafts and all the craft
grown stuff that it would come out
[SPEAKER_02]: different every time or somebody had
mastered its Variety, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They had taken one cultivar and that's all
they grew for the years and they had
[SPEAKER_02]: really dialed it in I know some old
hippies they still do That you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like that that's in my opinion is the
best right where you've mastered that
[SPEAKER_02]: because the thing is is like everything
requires Different inputs to a degree or
[SPEAKER_02]: or different variables, you know Whether
it's harvesting on a certain date and
[SPEAKER_02]: playing around with that or whether you
need to push it harder in the beginning or
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end You know, I think there's
there's so much to cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: learning the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And then there's something special
bubba kush was good back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but was amazing the master kush the
bubba kush the Hindu kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was not a fan of that because my
friends grew way too much of it But like
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first got my hands on it,
it was amazing And like they crossed it
[SPEAKER_01]: into so many different things that really
oh, yeah, really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great plant I really like I said,
I miss the variety that we used to have I
[SPEAKER_01]: like the access that people have now I
like I like going I do demos at stores
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing all these people coming just buying
gummies who like five years ago wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have even gone near a cannabis shop So I
love like how open it is, but I do I do
[SPEAKER_01]: miss the old the old guard I do miss the
old farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do miss the old Quality right and then I
miss people just appreciating flower like
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to dab But I'd rather have a joint
any day of the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss an appreciation of sungrown It's
like I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people have so much so much mass
produced like stuff They don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that the best stuff on earth comes off of
some mountain somewhere that someone
[SPEAKER_02]: picked, you know And they've probably
never experienced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing is like there's so much
people think oh, I know weed I smoke weed
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time I go to the dispensary I go
to this guy and he's you know I go to my
[SPEAKER_02]: plug and he's got the weed like I've tried
they think they've tried a lot of it and
[SPEAKER_02]: But they don't think sungrown is great or
better or superior and it's a different
[SPEAKER_02]: product, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like especially the effect like we've gone
away from talking about effect Which I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like we need to go back in that
direction to like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly Yeah, and there's a handful
of us that are really kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: push that agenda And I think it's gonna
catch on because at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're all attracted to this
plan It's not because the way it looks the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it tastes is maybe cool, but it's
really the effect It's the feeling I miss
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to smoke something again Go to
sleep like I miss when Indica's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: put you to sleep because that's really how
I GP that gives you the munchies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean, that's how I really got any
cannabis I had trouble sleeping when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: a kid like all throughout my childhood I
couldn't sleep at all and the first time I
[SPEAKER_01]: had the first time but when I really
started being able to get regular sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: was when high school I discovered cannabis
and so the first few years I had cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times I wouldn't smoke throughout
the day But I always made sure I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: bedtime bowl because I knew I would
actually be able to go to sleep that night
[SPEAKER_01]: and then actually work in medical cannabis
and realize there's all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of cannabis for all these different
things and you experiment with All that
[SPEAKER_01]: and they kind of kind of fall in love with
that and then you see now rec has taken
[SPEAKER_01]: over and we've walked away from it being a
Experiential base or being about health
[SPEAKER_01]: and medicine and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's just like pretty colors high
tech THC scores We've really lost a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Instagram weed will only get you so
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, but I think Instagram and
social media has they've changed the way
[SPEAKER_02]: we look at cannabis in general,
you know, but I think There's no no time
[SPEAKER_02]: like the present to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think like podcasts you have
your own podcast Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, you know, I think podcasts are
a great way to influence people to change
[SPEAKER_02]: telling your story telling the the world
About the effects of cannabis and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's not just about getting high And
I think people can relate to that too
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know, it's like people have
taken that edible dose It's like 500
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams and it's like some people never
want to take edibles again because they've
[SPEAKER_01]: taken too big of a dose Yeah, we used to
scare a lot of people off now That's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the one improvement about what's
going on in the market is back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the edibles are really really
strong that when someone came in We were
[SPEAKER_01]: just absolutely give them a hundred
milligram cookie not realizing that five
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams would have been perfect for him
and now it's the opposite like it's hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to find something that has a lot of
milligrams in it and that's safer for so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people and so many more people do
have like a gentle experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles, which is really nice to see I
think it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think because That's a great way to turn
someone off from the very beginning from
[SPEAKER_02]: their first experience They're like,
oh, I'm gonna go get a hundred milligram
[SPEAKER_02]: edible and then it's like, okay Well,
I never want to do that again because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to feel like that but the thing
is is like if you'd eaten five milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: or ten milligrams or maybe Even 20 you
would have had a much different experience
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting because it's it's
it's so important that people have a great
[SPEAKER_01]: proper introduction to cannabis is again
having Having edible that's too strong is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna really turn you off and kind of turn
you away from everything In the same way a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good topical can be great to get
people involved in it I like giving
[SPEAKER_01]: topicals to older folks Realizing that
they can deal with pain relief without
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the medicine cabinet having
something Safer more holistic and that
[SPEAKER_01]: opens them to cannabis in general You can
start with the topical move over to a
[SPEAKER_02]: small gummy and get them deeply They got
bath bombs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so wild and we live in this world of
convenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Before we had to really work to
do it, you know, like roll a joint now
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pre rolls or hand rolls,
you know before dabbing it was like there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a lot of different ways we smoke like
atom smashers Smoking on coal and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's so hot knives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still miss the hot knife.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great There was like these weird
little errors were like I remember hot
[SPEAKER_01]: knives in high school I went to high
school in the 90s that I remember had a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend that lived in Spain and so he would
go out and visit his dad every year and
[SPEAKER_01]: they would come back with hash and they
would put a little bit of hash in the hot
[SPEAKER_01]: knife and Completely blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, and then seeing them They
started making like glass hot knives like
[SPEAKER_01]: a little glass like spoons and they had
like a little divot in it with the knob on
[SPEAKER_01]: the other end so you could really get it
in there and I remember a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: he had a Like a glass little thing that
you inhale through that had a big hole in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle You could put ice in it and you
put a cork in it so it cooled the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of this this little flume that you kind of
hit this like I think you can attribute
[SPEAKER_02]: some of that to the plant right like the
creative side of it Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how can I make this experience
better?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I got some guys that are for
my friends Marlon Asher introduced me to
[SPEAKER_02]: catch a fire and those guys are from New
Zealand and in New Zealand They have their
[SPEAKER_02]: own version of hot knives It's a torch
that has the knives on the end of it It
[SPEAKER_02]: heats the knife up and you push the button
you put the button there and you squeeze
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you hit it out of a tube Oh,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's wild and like I would never
have normally done it, but I was backstage
[SPEAKER_02]: at a show and Marlon's like, oh,
yeah We got to smoke with these guys and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were like dude You have to hit this
and I normally would have been like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know but I was like, okay,
I'll do it Yeah, it got totally ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're however people present it where
they're from Like this is what we do at
[SPEAKER_01]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to try that you want to get a
taste of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a different experience,
you know, there's so many different ways
[SPEAKER_02]: you can smoke I mean you got your puff Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my focus V.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Ways of convenience and it's just so
easy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So and then we have all these flavors too
I mean I got a variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Long flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some really short flowering
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the skittles Candy candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really gone candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know more than anything,
especially with extracts is candy candy
[SPEAKER_02]: candy flower, too But you know and then
but we're missing out on some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing long flowering varieties when it
comes to flower I prefer a sativa I prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: things that they grow like that,
but when it does come and then in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big candy fan, but when it comes
to dabbing I like The candy stuff all day
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't like it when they press
anything else is really interesting I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, I'll sit there watching TV and I'll
just smell too I'll dab it I'll also just
[SPEAKER_02]: smell the X jack because I just love the
way it smells I do that with bud but more
[SPEAKER_02]: so with little jars because it's just I
have these little jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's concentrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Wow, there's some long flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very Jackie Yeah, super silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, super silver in Flora flame those
guys are great another Oakland company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all practically neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great I didn't I was under the
impression that sativas don't press very
[SPEAKER_01]: well and that's why we don't see a lot of
sativa It's true is the rosin market But
[SPEAKER_01]: to know that silver silver silver does
like I could just have that as my sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: and just be happy right there It'll do it
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is is it's one of those ones
where you don't need a big dab of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Palpitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you do too much like for me,
I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good daytime thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Or morning I go to the gym,
you know, and it's like now rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like these are great for rosin cards
and I get in trouble I work out a lot and
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely smoke before I go in the gym
But I I can't use the cart because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: keep hitting it the whole time I'm like in
the car as if as a joint It's the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning middle and end so I don't over
consume because I had a cart for 45
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes then go in The cardio is not so
good Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just do the two hits like I'll do one
or two hits the two hits the most in
[SPEAKER_02]: moderation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps me focus it helps Me get through
cardio if I have to go do cardio if it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: cardio day, I do enjoy Smoking a pen and
it's like depending on the day and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mood some things I don't I cannot smoke in
the gym We like now I got to get out of
[SPEAKER_02]: here But other things it's like skittles
to skittles is one of those ones that the
[SPEAKER_02]: extract of skittles is super Mild compared
to other ones, but it leaves that taste in
[SPEAKER_02]: your mouth, too So when you're working
out, you're like, yeah, I'm smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really this year I've been stuck
on the white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah We talk about it on almost every
episode of the podcast I'm disgusted with
[SPEAKER_01]: myself how much I like it and I'll cuz
I'll still like I go out I buy a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: buy from a lot of different brands just
kind of see what's currency when people
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing and the amount of times I'm just
go back to the white thorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my favorite thing of all these
things that I bought I'm most embarrassed
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you shouldn't be because I'm that
same way and I feel like it's good old
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel-good weed and we need to get back to
more of that stuff that the effect is so
[SPEAKER_02]: important like with white thorn rose It
just makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you smoke it you can do anything you
conquer the world Blue dream does that to
[SPEAKER_02]: a degree, but it's different And my buddy
Dave that's for passed away on 420 his
[SPEAKER_02]: blue 13 has the exact same effect as white
thorn work Okay, you can smoke it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel great You smoke it in the
evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel great doesn't matter when you
smoke it what you're doing You just feel
[SPEAKER_02]: really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like those people that haven't
experienced that with cannabis that are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I don't know I don't think cannabis
for me that should probably try white
[SPEAKER_02]: thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it's just it's it's one of those
profiles where it's like It just makes you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel whole or complete, you know,
and like that's that's what I love about
[SPEAKER_01]: it I love giving people their first dab or
even their second dab because I do a dab
[SPEAKER_01]: bars like because I'd rather do a dab bar
than a demo I don't want to sit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner of a club I'd rather go to there's
a lounge where people can try things they
[SPEAKER_01]: can sample things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we met Exactly and just being
able to offer something that tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious and then also I'm very keen on
low temp small dabs in the beginning so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can kind of just get the flavor of it
and not overwhelm and so many people their
[SPEAKER_01]: first dab was red hot and Just burning
screaming kind of experience that I like
[SPEAKER_01]: 900 degrees Give them something gentle
something that tastes amazing and just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of seeing their eyes light up and
they're like I had no idea it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: this good I had no idea this experience
could be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the perfect temp for you for low
temp?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna depend on the consistency of
the concentrate a hundred percent I always
[SPEAKER_01]: go for as low as possible But certain
things like I mean, I don't like to dab
[SPEAKER_01]: diamonds But if you're dabbing diamonds,
they want more heat than like a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah usually I mean, I guess I could open
up the app on my puffco I could tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly I think for my normal puffcove my
my low temp on the puffco is around 450.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes 475 Roger from puffco.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he does 530.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing and he has access to
everything So I started cranking mine up
[SPEAKER_01]: just to like well, I guess it's okay And
it's just a little hotter than I like but
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely you feel it so much more when
it is a little bit hotter Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I like the high fours low fives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this actually I want to taste it my
thing like I'm gonna keep hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't need to just get wasted I
don't need to get loaded immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather just dab I'm gonna dab for a
long period of time anyway, so I'd rather
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of savor the flavor of mine's a
420 I like that for that low.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to remember too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your temp?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 420 Yeah, and that's low low temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some people go even lower than
that, but I feel like that 420 is about
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you get a lot of flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the device too because each one a
little bit differently definitely on my on
[SPEAKER_01]: my focus V I have it Dialed lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it's hotter for real for
those I don't know which one's more
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate than the other but I know on my
own on my focus I should have brought it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have it on the counter sitting
right next to my puff go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's significant It might be 375 or like
low force.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, try this This is the rover you can
you can change the temp of that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent Yeah, and it's convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the convenience of it and I love
the price point It's there $80.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's perfect, you know, and I'm not
getting paid to advertise this at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love all the devices out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the fucking toys like I always
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and I love the guys that are
pushing the envelope on stuff and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: out new stuff and they might not hit it
out of the park every time but like dip
[SPEAKER_02]: device they had a the original little
dipper is like the straw like the e-straw
[SPEAKER_02]: right where you can just dip it in and I
was like, oh whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big nectar collector guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always liked the nectar collectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a drawer full of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they're fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're easy to use and then they have
this E version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, it's a drawer for six
months badger Yeah, every time they get I
[SPEAKER_01]: got one I wound up giving away it
immediately because it was just like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be the torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, and so I used it after six
months I'm like, oh, this is great for
[SPEAKER_02]: events where I go to and I want to try
everybody's stuff But I don't have time to
[SPEAKER_02]: take a you know, like it's there's a
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's time and I want convenience
It's the most convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just open the jar up Yeah,
and hopefully you don't burn their extract
[SPEAKER_02]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thing because I never whenever
someone brings it out I'm like I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: just giving you my jar because you'll just
Yeah, big old mason jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like putting a big old mark in it,
you know, like no good Yeah, but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I love about our industry that
there's just so much variety There's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many options just seeing all the merch you
have when I walked in here Just reminded
[SPEAKER_01]: me how much an exciting space that we're
in right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're about to launch loud times
It's our brand our clothing lifestyle
[SPEAKER_02]: brand that we're about to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's rooted in Oakland Yeah,
just like everything else we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like yeah, this this community is
great, you know, and it's like very
[SPEAKER_02]: supportive of other small businesses That
are still around because it's tough these
[SPEAKER_02]: days, you know, it's very tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tough So yeah, and then the lifestyle
brand it's like cookies does really well
[SPEAKER_02]: with theirs backpack boys is doing well
with theirs You know, we're a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different than those guys and we have our
own style and what makes us you just I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I think the key with Merchandising is
like you speak to your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean cookies is cookies I mean,
that's that's a burner is there's
[SPEAKER_01]: four-year-olds wearing cookies t-shirts
with backpack boys like if you know them
[SPEAKER_01]: like they are very much in tune with their
Community and absolutely in tune with them
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's very organic and all that and I
feel like your brand has that I can do
[SPEAKER_01]: that as well because you're speaking to a
certain group of folks that are out there
[SPEAKER_02]: that like what cool stuff so Yeah,
and everybody wants cool stuff to a degree
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to find you got to get in
where you fit in Yeah, you know at the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the day and it's like an authenticity
just goes so far with this industry You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's like you can spot it a mile
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of there's a lot of People
that have come in from other industries
[SPEAKER_02]: and they weren't cannabis guys,
but they're like I'm gonna make money
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis and you might be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time you're not so they're
never they never really are now I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: they think they're gonna be and it's funny
because I've been in legal cannabis Since
[SPEAKER_01]: oh six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think and then I was on the
Oakland cannabis regulatory commission for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while Like I was doing like a lot of
stuff and then I wound up I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: Consulting with various people that were
coming in to this coming into Oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to start businesses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was always these investment bankers
and they're just like yeah We're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have a brownie and I'm like, no,
you're not like you're not they go they
[SPEAKER_01]: think they can come in and Re-event the
wheel like you guys just didn't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it right and it's like no You don't
you don't want to learn the lessons of all
[SPEAKER_01]: these businesses that I've tried and
failed around us from people who've
[SPEAKER_01]: actually been here in this community not
like Oakland but in the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: right understand like what's going on with
these products and they're just like no we
[SPEAKER_01]: know better and we're gonna come in with
our money Oh, yeah spreadsheets and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna show you and we got someone from
Nestle and they know how to make We have
[SPEAKER_01]: this chocolatier from so-and-so and I'm
like bro Christie Akiva is gonna kill you
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're not gonna survive like you can
have all These people you want but we have
[SPEAKER_01]: products that already exist that have been
doing really well for a good reason And
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not just gonna come and replicate
that or do you improve on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like yeah it's in that that
space is so different than cultivation in
[SPEAKER_02]: the regard that The companies that are
doing really well It's not easy to just go
[SPEAKER_02]: in and like I got a good product that it's
gonna sell it's like there's so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: to it and Just cuz you think you have a
good product doesn't mean that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily gonna fit into what the world
wants Yeah, I love just seeing that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the older Brands that are hanging on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like he was like one of them and we
were Selling key when I was a bud tinder I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't think of any products that are on
the shelf today that were on the shelf and
[SPEAKER_01]: oh eight kind of a thing You know,
there's a handful of brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been around like Maya's somehow still
here with oh, oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: They crushed Just everything I mean and I
always felt like she I mean her whole
[SPEAKER_01]: movement was dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: She always had an amazing team She always
had great products and they always just I
[SPEAKER_01]: loved what they did for the community in
our culture And I love to see the few
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that are kind of still hanging
around from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally Yeah, yeah, there's a handful of
brands still hanging on that are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: their thing and yeah Oh makes great
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their gummies are amazing rosin gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, can't go wrong with rosin I just I
like I love edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually when I started the Oakland
extracts I started I was working at
[SPEAKER_01]: Harborside and I met my business partner
out Aaron Tran.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked there with me Yeah, and he's a
former chef and we really wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles like we're eating edibles all day
at work talking about edibles all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: so the plan like we're gonna do some
edibles and then he learned how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: some hash with some of our friends and
next thing you know, we have a hash
[SPEAKER_01]: company instead and every time we have a
meeting is like when are we doing edibles
[SPEAKER_01]: like we would love edibles and there's
just a lot of other corners of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that are a lot of fun,
but everything is so treacherous now It's
[SPEAKER_01]: like you got to have a firm footing in
what you do before you start expanding Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, especially in edibles, but you know
rosin gummies are a great way to go
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with the extract company I feel
like that's the most authentic way to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it is yeah Extract it yourself put some
white thorn rose in a gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are those are my favorite that I've
had so far in my whole life White thorn
[SPEAKER_02]: rose gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know who did it,
but I've had a couple this year and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I believe Rosentek did some and but
there's a couple other companies that have
[SPEAKER_01]: done them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've have always had trouble with
Sugar-based edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I come from cannabis is
medicine and it's like I'm not gonna give
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who has cancer and tell them each
sugar every day to fight your cancer Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like even like no when I was at
harbor side when there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferation of gummies there works a lot
of cookies a lot of brownies and just
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in the Sweet category and then
there were a few savories back then and I
[SPEAKER_01]: really feel like Creating edibles that are
actually healthy are a good wave and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's enough candy out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's enough cookies out there I guess
no everyone's gone for Pete But I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: there's enough of the sweet things that
are out there on the market That is time
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of like diversify that up So I'd
like to do something kind of other than
[SPEAKER_01]: the gummy something isn't sugar based the
tinctures were good But it's not edible
[SPEAKER_02]: right but the tinctures were good amber
alchemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's we had her on the show Rachel yeah,
she's amazing and I love For medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tinctures are probably the best
but there are food options that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely I'm a big fan of jade
nectar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're really strong Sativa
tinctures that are just just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consume a lot of uncle Arnie's Yeah,
I'd probably consume more uncle Arnie's
[SPEAKER_01]: than my own product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I love beverages I love the
beverage space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another space I kind of wanted to
get into but I see how difficult that is
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm staying far away It's just a lot
of money to get involved in Bev,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like I feel like for sure like
that is The space to be in in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: in cannabis I think like when you go into
a 7-eleven when you go into a grocery
[SPEAKER_01]: store We devote so much more space to
beverage than any other type of snack food
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that clearly Americans know how
to drink their calories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like drinking their calories And so I
think the beverage space is just gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: keep expanding for sure and then you got
coca-cola and big companies Eyeing it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's money there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we gonna approach this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean we already have the alcohol
people got Lagunitas paps and eyes I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm not a big fan of I'm I'm okay
with Lagunitas because it's Like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: small time that like there's our local
stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are a big company now, but they
weren't behind it can now but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony McGee Okay, so there are real people
right whereas when I see like paps are
[SPEAKER_01]: really st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ides I'm like you contributed to so much
negativity in our culture with malt liquor
[SPEAKER_01]: not paps and more st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ides sure that now that you're gonna come
you're gonna come into our space now like
[SPEAKER_01]: like stay over there your liquor like we
don't need you over here, but it's like We
[SPEAKER_01]: have our own message.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our own story To tell and you had
your time you told a story and you had an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on the community and now it's over
there now This is something else that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing but it's America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's free to do what they want But
I'm that excited good luck in our space
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck, you know coming in with that
model into our space like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I love the uncle Arnie's like I
love the people that that's cannabis Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a stoner's like I want to be in
this space What do I make and then he made
[SPEAKER_01]: something organically because he wanted to
be in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like that story better Yeah,
yeah, Coca-cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you remember the token So
I think before 2005 Coca-cola was a big
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there was a couple beverages They
the beverages the companies all got taken
[SPEAKER_02]: down by the feds guys did years in prison
Yeah beyond bomb best edible company to
[SPEAKER_02]: exist ever one of my good friends He did
five years for edibles doing it legally in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, but we had a beverage at
harborside I forgot I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those THC designs was the name of
the guys company He had these little
[SPEAKER_01]: cheesecakes where they medicated the
graham cracker crust in the bowl That were
[SPEAKER_01]: strong and delicious and then he had a
mango lassi a chai and iced coffee And
[SPEAKER_01]: then I think one other Beverly eggnog
around the holidays and each of those
[SPEAKER_01]: little little like little milk carton
bottles I think there might about 80
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams a piece and then at work we
just take pour two or three of them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blender with one of the brownies and just
Sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh good times good times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet I bet yeah, and I love edibles I and
I I love edibles in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't eat edibles as much Especially
yeah, so edibles affect me so they're so
[SPEAKER_02]: strong Yeah for me I smoke I can smoke
joints I can smoke big three gram joints
[SPEAKER_02]: and sit there for an hour and puff on a
joint No problem, but then I go for like a
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 mil 20 milligrams two gummies,
you know, because California is 10
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams per gummy is the maximum dose
Although they are selling hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram packages.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be 10 doses Yeah,
we had 20 milligrams will get me now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never measured anything So we would eat
cookies and brownies and it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, how strong can we make it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember I'm used to make cupcakes
That's how a lot of people like back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I used to make these cupcakes I do
because I I was working with the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are growing strawberry cough and this
is they're just throwing away their trim
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would just give me bucket loads of
fresh indoor trim and I'd make this butter
[SPEAKER_01]: and make these strawberry cough cupcakes
and they were like electric there was this
[SPEAKER_01]: a psychedelic experience eating those so
we were mega dosing and then when I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: at Harborside we had crow we had the
thousand milligram black bars and then
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was there was like hazing when I
was a bud tinder but like how many edibles
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could eat on shift and like can
hold your Shit together because you still
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look too and they reated you're
gonna get in trouble So you can't like sit
[SPEAKER_01]: there looking wasted Although sometimes we
did and so there was a race to get to how
[SPEAKER_01]: many people could eat a hundred milligrams
on an empty stomach first thing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning and clear through your shift
without making mistake there's like that
[SPEAKER_01]: going on but I can't do that now and I
mean if I eat edibles now I'll do the
[SPEAKER_01]: uncle Arnie's I'll smash that hundred
milligrams, but if I get too much beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm in trouble and when I used to be
able to do 1200 without thinking about it
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the secret to making butter
because I got my own recipe everyone has
[SPEAKER_01]: their own recipe what I did I did a crock
pot and I always cut it with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so I would do a couple pounds of
butter really fresh even then I was right
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was freezing the trim even though
people kept telling me you didn't didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: matter because I guess it does fuck I mean
I grew like we had it everywhere and so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd freeze the trim even we weren't
supposed to only use sugar trim never use
[SPEAKER_01]: the fans or the any of the other stuff
that put it in a crock pot I would do 12
[SPEAKER_01]: to 16 hours in a crock pot with a couple
pounds of butter a couple cups of water
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I'd keep it at a low rolling boil
and then I would keep refilling it with
[SPEAKER_01]: water so I keep a certain amount of water
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then then like strain it into a
through a cheesecloth into a metal bowl
[SPEAKER_01]: put in the refrigerator let the water and
butter separate it and then dump out that
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty water or save it for something else
and then I would take that hockey puck of
[SPEAKER_01]: butter and then I would melt it down and
kind of do a clarified butter thing right
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pour off the top where it was just
it was just almost clear it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect whereas the lower part was a
little bit sluggier and that kind of had
[SPEAKER_01]: more of like I feel like it had more of
the indica stuff in it that but that might
[SPEAKER_01]: have been all psychosomatic and and when I
would make my cupcakes I would use an
[SPEAKER_01]: indica for the cake and I would use a
sativa for the icing and so people would
[SPEAKER_01]: lick the icing and that and because you're
licking it it's kind of sublingual so
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you get lit quick you know
especially when like you're mega dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: the icing and so they have a certain kind
of a high then they eat the cake and that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't kick in for like another 20 30
minutes takes them a completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: direction I used to do damage I used to do
sounds like fun oh we had so much fun
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like fun yeah really exciting yeah
we so I was told the Native Americans
[SPEAKER_02]: would boil it you know this is when I was
in high school so people were like oh yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: you do the cheesecloth you wrap it in
cheesecloth with a rock use a big pot and
[SPEAKER_02]: you boil it you let it cool if it's cold
outside you just put it out overnight and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you set you cover it and then you go
out the next day you got a disc on the top
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and then the more weed you put in
and I feel like that's the most that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: best way to make it super super super
concentrated because you can put a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: trim in there and it's the best but butter
is the best fat is the best carrier like I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't care what science is happening I
don't care about nano anything you give me
[SPEAKER_01]: a butter based edible and it's just gonna
be stronger than the rest of them and I
[SPEAKER_01]: love that's why again I still mess with
Big Pete's I mean because it's like those
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies and make some cookies with butter
I love that you know just the old tech is
[SPEAKER_02]: always better and they got to taste good
back in the day we didn't care as much
[SPEAKER_02]: they tasted like weed when it is be green
like oh my god it's strong I remember we
[SPEAKER_02]: used to eat brownies where they just put
the weed in the brown yeah literally burn
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of your throat as I don't think
I'm supposed to be pulling weed in between
[SPEAKER_01]: my teeth pulling little twigs out but it's
great figuring it out it's just that that
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and I just remember like growing
up and then people like giving you
[SPEAKER_01]: brownies in the hate yeah like get ready
to cook it man there are people selling it
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they were selling it to like the
tourists and like the older people and
[SPEAKER_01]: like the yuppies or whatever but just
being like a teenager they're just give it
[SPEAKER_01]: to you so you just get cookies brownies
and we're gonna get into that hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent would cut school go to telegraph
half in Berkeley yeah as a 250 a pop go to
[SPEAKER_01]: blonde is get a slice of pizza in the
people's park and that was the day so we
[SPEAKER_02]: grew up in the same area yeah that's what
we used to yeah totally the park over
[SPEAKER_01]: there was amazing yeah yeah old Cody's
before they moved Cody's down the fourth
[SPEAKER_01]: with the yuppies oh yeah beautiful
blondies Cody's books and Moe's books that
[SPEAKER_01]: was like my triangle in Berkeley yeah but
that's the beauty of the Bay was the
[SPEAKER_01]: beauty of I guess living anywhere but I do
appreciate the Bay I do love San Francisco
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Oakland I love the Bay Area I love
the diversity culture we have yeah culture
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the best culture in the world in my
opinion and there's a lot of great culture
[SPEAKER_02]: in other places but there's so much
diversity here on all levels it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: matter what you like or what you're into
there's something for you you know you can
[SPEAKER_02]: go to the ocean it's like right there you
can go up to the mountains during the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter it's like everything is so close we
got the Redwoods we've got great hiking
[SPEAKER_01]: camping we're blessed my uncle had some
weed shops in LA when I was younger and he
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't really smoking at this point so I
would go with him up to Humboldt to get
[SPEAKER_01]: packs and just going up on the mountain
and just seeing all the different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers coming down and seeing all the
variety and stuff that like never left the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain like we took a lot of stuff that
back to LA but the brokers always were
[SPEAKER_01]: like because I smoked and he did and
they're like we're never selling him this
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want to smoke a little bit like
this is just doesn't leave the mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a thing and just trying the
sampling that and then realizing again
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you're not up there or going up
there you really don't know how good it
[SPEAKER_01]: can get kind of a thing like what we get
down here is just it's just what we get
[SPEAKER_01]: down here kind of a thing and I love that
about this plant and our culture and I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess it's a beauty of California because
we have that about produce we have
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal produce top and bottom but oh
yeah there's some of the best produce in
[SPEAKER_02]: the world and I think the abundance of
produce yeah I love seeing that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to see cannabis farms grow food
again like because the mom and pops kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of went away but some of the bigger ones
are kind of trying to build that back into
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing so they're offering
food and cannabis from the same place kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of pairing it I know happy day farms is a
really good job with that and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of other places that people have
popped up recently they've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: events I think it's uh I don't want to say
the wrong name but there's other folks out
[SPEAKER_01]: there doing this and I really like the
idea of like people being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that this is an agricultural
product and it doesn't have to be separate
[SPEAKER_01]: from this this can be part of your
experience of going to farmers market
[SPEAKER_01]: buying good fruits growing veggies buying
this kind of produce as well and having it
[SPEAKER_02]: all together I like that totally so tell
me about Oakland extracts I know you
[SPEAKER_02]: touched on it a little bit about edibles
yes let's dive into Oakland extracts how
[SPEAKER_01]: that came about and where it started in
2013 of my buddy Aaron Tran and we both
[SPEAKER_01]: worked at Harborside like I said we've
been talking about making edibles we kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of wanted to do that in part we knew part
of that process was hash you have to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: how to make great hash especially back
then you really need to learn how to make
[SPEAKER_01]: great hash to make great edibles and I
left Harborside to work on a farm and he
[SPEAKER_01]: started working with some guys at
Harborside learning how to make some hash
[SPEAKER_01]: I started coming back from the farm and we
kind of reconnected and we're like okay
[SPEAKER_01]: let's let's do this I started bringing him
like a lot of really really good product
[SPEAKER_01]: because working on a farm and no one was
doing the throwing it away and piles of
[SPEAKER_01]: trim were sitting around this farm just
rotting in the sun kind of a thing and um
[SPEAKER_01]: it's back when everyone's just giving trim
away so I bring it home and he would make
[SPEAKER_01]: this just phenomenal phenomenal wax and
shatter and we were just kind of giving it
[SPEAKER_01]: away to our friends and all that and then
one of our friends who's a buyer at
[SPEAKER_01]: Harborside he's like you need to stop just
giving this away you need to sell this for
[SPEAKER_01]: real and start selling it in the stores
and and it was this was back when they
[SPEAKER_01]: would not accept branded product when
you're just bringing in slabs of shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: or tupperware full of wax and um and I
remember one of the one of the stores is
[SPEAKER_01]: like you we actually need you to name it
because it's so much better than the other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that we're bringing in it's
confusing the customers they want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to ask for yours and again it was
because I was just doing I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting really good material I kind of
didn't have the capitalist sense of if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're selling it as fast as you can make
it you should just get more trim and make
[SPEAKER_01]: more of it I was just getting what I got
from these guys was giving me phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: trim so the product was super super high
level at all times and um and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to have a name and what we're from
Oakland and then I grew up around Oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: so I grew up watching the crane and all
that kind of stuff and then and also you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it was it was so good and so
affordable and like we could sell it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: really affordable way this is back when
most of the good wax and shatter was 80 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 dollars a gram for no reason like we
didn't just I remember working at
[SPEAKER_01]: Harborside where there was no bh o there's
only water hash because steve and them
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't messing with b butane they didn't
like the idea of that and I remember when
[SPEAKER_01]: they started selling it it went from 40 to
60 to 70 dollars a gram like in a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of months because it was selling so fast
and the you know market forces and the
[SPEAKER_01]: people producing it started wanting to
sell it for more so we started making it
[SPEAKER_01]: we realized that because we had access to
this phenomenal farm was basically giving
[SPEAKER_01]: us whatever we wanted we could have
product out there that was good as a 60 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 dollars stuff for only like 30 bucks
yeah and that was kind of our thing top
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf quality at an everyday price we
wanted to have this phenomenal product but
[SPEAKER_01]: not be super expensive and that really
came from working at harborside in oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: when all of a sudden we went from not
really having a lot of hash to all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden there's a bunch of 80 to 100 dollar
grams and people would be like they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even they didn't know what it was like
they they called it super milk yeah and so
[SPEAKER_01]: i was like why is this super milk 100
dollars a gram who knows paying 100
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars a gram and the customer fuck that
this is oakland ain't nobody paying 100
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars a gram and they would storm out
and us as staff we'd laugh because we
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it we know how good it is we also
know how expensive their price was and it
[SPEAKER_01]: became like this running joke like this is
oakland ain't nobody paying for all that
[SPEAKER_01]: and so when train and i started making it
and it was like it was really good and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was yielding a lot and we had it at a
really low price so oakland extracts is
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable and approachable and um that
was really kind of like our initial idea
[SPEAKER_01]: was that we just want to have really good
hash and we're making shatter and um and
[SPEAKER_01]: some wax and we kept having people like no
none of my friends were dabbing this is
[SPEAKER_01]: blowtorch era yeah so dabbing was like
something that you had to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with the torch so no one in my
community i won't say no one but i didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know any brown people that were dabbing it
looked like freebase people weren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: for it yeah i kept telling tran like i'm
selling all this shatter but it's like our
[SPEAKER_01]: folks really aren't buying it and people
keep asking for something they can roll up
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the wax was inconsistent and
sometimes it's gooey sometimes it's dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not for someone who's trying to
roll something up it's not convenient for
[SPEAKER_01]: all them always to buy it to roll and i
kept telling about that and he's like well
[SPEAKER_01]: i can make the wax in these little one
gram wafers that are really really dry so
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be like a little vanilla wafer and
they can just crumble it up over a joint
[SPEAKER_01]: blender bowl and that's really kind of
what put us on the map so most people that
[SPEAKER_01]: know oakland extracts from 10 years ago
they know is from these little one gram
[SPEAKER_01]: wafers that look like uh vanilla wafers
actually like a very small version of this
[SPEAKER_01]: this is this is a larger one that he made
with rosin and so we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: re-release the we call them coins for a
minute we're going to re-release them but
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been really slow about it because we
would we wanted to make it from rosin as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to wax and not every type of rosin
can you like kind of get that dry and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that stable really cool and so
we've really been kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: refocus on that so you can microplane that
right over your exactly or really my
[SPEAKER_01]: thought was like i got i have lots of
friends in oakland who stand around on
[SPEAKER_01]: various street corners are kind of rolling
blunts and they do it and everything's in
[SPEAKER_01]: their hand they take it they bust up the
weed in their hand there's no grinder like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is just two hands going and
this is something that they can just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of mix right in the go with it and just be
really on the go oh yeah and um that was
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of well hash holes are trending
really hard right now yeah that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of got us re-inspired about that
because i mean it's i'd rather i mean wet
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin definitely does have a different
taste than dry rosin it is more succulent
[SPEAKER_01]: but when it comes to rolling something up
when you're on the go all that goopy shit
[SPEAKER_01]: got to have a tool it's just a mess right
so we want to have something that's easier
[SPEAKER_01]: for people that are out there mobile like
most people are with their smoking nice um
[SPEAKER_01]: but anyway so we started doing that we did
that uh through the medical era when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no rules no taxes everything was
great backyard blasting all that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and then prop 215 and then when prop
64 happened we actually had like serious
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations everything had to come out of
a licensed facility we had to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: change everything we were doing because
previously like i said blasting outside we
[SPEAKER_01]: had you know ovens in the basement kind of
a thing so we had actually find a real
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed facility to work out of and i
spent a year and a half trying to raise
[SPEAKER_01]: the money um this is back when you kind of
could raise money without having real
[SPEAKER_01]: receipts it was that weird transition
period where there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into california trying to invest in
companies that were in 215 trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to 64 but people were being offered really
raw deals and so there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different times where i got offered deals
that i thought were okay and then i had
[SPEAKER_01]: someone read it later and they're like no
you almost sold your life you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: gave your life away happened a lot yeah
and so i'm lucky that i didn't do that but
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of created an issue where we
didn't really have startup money so that
[SPEAKER_01]: was a hassle for a long time and i um i've
known the guys at jetty since they moved
[SPEAKER_01]: up here from san diego yeah and nate's one
of my friends yeah i love nate ron the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole crew and um and ron kept saying
because i ron he used to go to all these
[SPEAKER_01]: events i'd see him at any random oakland
event it wasn't just cannabis events like
[SPEAKER_01]: when they first came up here like he made
sure they're in like going to community
[SPEAKER_01]: events too to kind of really understand
the community was coming into and i kept
[SPEAKER_01]: running into him and we kind of developed
a cool little friendship and he's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you can just make your stuff here but
i didn't like the idea of i really didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like the idea of white labeling i didn't
like the idea of just like someone else
[SPEAKER_01]: making your stuff right and um they knew
tran they knew tran was really a good guy
[SPEAKER_01]: so like okay we'll hire tran or your
partner who makes everything he can
[SPEAKER_01]: physically work at our facility and make
your products but it can still come
[SPEAKER_01]: through our license facility so we kind of
found a way to be able to get our stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: through a license channel but actually
still have our hands in the mix of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because again i want to make because
tran's a former chef like he knows the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors that we want he knows how we want
things to be absolutely so he's able to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pick and choose things that are
there and kind of make it up to our
[SPEAKER_01]: specifications and we've been doing that
ever since nice so what were some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: difficulties you went through with
starting your own business in oakland you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we have an equity program and all
that um the equity program is complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: i was actually on the oakland cannabis
regulatory commission when they created or
[SPEAKER_01]: when we created the equity program desley
brooks councilwoman desley brooks was the
[SPEAKER_01]: one who created that and it was born from
a good idea that like there's definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of people who have been in the
cannabis business for 20 30 40 years and
[SPEAKER_01]: have dealt with all the the punishments
and repercussions of that and then when
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization happened there was an
opportunity for them to jump straight in
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there was definitely a need to
create some kind of system to address that
[SPEAKER_01]: the system we have is uh doesn't work very
well for a variety of reasons um and so i
[SPEAKER_01]: stayed out of that program although i
really probably wasn't eligible for the
[SPEAKER_01]: program anyway because he had to come from
a certain zip code and i've never been to
[SPEAKER_01]: jail and all that kind of stuff but there
was people finding their ways into the
[SPEAKER_01]: program but i was really uncomfortable
about the program because i didn't like
[SPEAKER_01]: the relationship that i created between
you and the person incubating you and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was it and in certain cases it was
predatory but consistently it was
[SPEAKER_01]: condescending and i kept seeing these
people and it's like i know this doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: do doesn't know how to do a business plan
or performa or art doesn't know what roi
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't know all that stuff but they know
miles more than you about how to market a
[SPEAKER_01]: product in this community so you're just
assuming because they don't know how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: these certain things that they don't have
all this other value that's that's that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can bring in too that always made me
really uncomfortable so i never wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to do with that personally in
terms of kind of signing up for it but i
[SPEAKER_01]: do um but i was i have been involved in
the program i've advised a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: who've been in the equity program kind of
on both sides of it and um done some
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting with some of the different
cities that are have like training
[SPEAKER_01]: programs and all that and i appreciate the
need for that um we came in when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: medical so we were making money before we
knew what we were doing kind of a thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and it quickly turned into like oh i have
to now buy a safe there's stacks of cash i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it was just like we didn't we were
just it just kind of erupted in front of
[SPEAKER_01]: us you know old school medical cannabis um
when 64 happened all that went away um
[SPEAKER_01]: i've been broker than ever the past couple
of years definitely the brokers i've been
[SPEAKER_01]: since i've been in cannabis have been the
last three years like without question um
[SPEAKER_01]: i feel lucky that we're still here there's
so many brands that were like bigger and
[SPEAKER_01]: better brands that are gone so many they
took money from the wrong person or they
[SPEAKER_01]: just they the ar got ahead of them and
they just they're just they don't exist
[SPEAKER_01]: and so i feel lucky just like when i see
like i'll see dorian from bezal i bro how
[SPEAKER_01]: are you still here like you know i just
want to talk to these guys who've been
[SPEAKER_01]: here longer than me and luckily like old
school cannabis people are really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: about sharing and so i have a lot of great
relationships with people who've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: the business longer than me who've been
only been open about hey maybe you should
[SPEAKER_01]: try this or this is the pivot i ran into
dorian in maryland a month ago i was
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting my family and he was out there
and he was trying to put me on game but
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how you can get into this state
this is the opportunities that are here
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah those guys know their shit yeah mike
mike and dorian but it's a beautiful thing
[SPEAKER_01]: where someone's like oh i have an
opportunity let me show you let me let me
[SPEAKER_01]: show you how to access this and as opposed
to so many other industries it's like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm not going to tell anyone anything the
trade secrets and all that i still feel
[SPEAKER_01]: the old school the legacy people in canada
legacy people will share with other legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: people that's for sure because we want to
see everyone succeed like i'll give anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: advice even if you're some corporate chump
it's like if you ask me a solid question
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm gonna give you an honest answer like
it's just like it's just telling the truth
[SPEAKER_02]: you know for sure we're all gonna make it
because well i think the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: persistent are gonna make it like the ones
that aren't taking no for an answer it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like at the end of the day it's like i i
don't want to be in any other space i love
[SPEAKER_02]: this space i'm on the genetic side so it's
a little bit different you know i feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like i'm more picks and shovels in regards
to that uh where i work with cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: partners i work with nursery partners we
work with we have partners in all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different spaces but we can have partners
in every state working with the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: side and it's like uh i think there's more
longevity for us in in this space doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that than cultivation it's just so
difficult and hats off to my friends that
[SPEAKER_02]: are cultivators dude you guys crushing it
it's like the ones that are doing it now
[SPEAKER_02]: growing super fire i mean top shell flower
it the only game there is now to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful at is growing top shell flower
if you're in cultivation the mids you're
[SPEAKER_02]: done you can't grow mids and survive
anymore the price is too low yeah we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with those corporate jobs we're
just doing it for dirt oh yeah oops it's
[SPEAKER_01]: wild we're in wild times but it is
interesting i will agree that like when 64
[SPEAKER_01]: first happened the cannabis that we had on
our shelves was a mess it was like the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were doing good work were not
ready to flip the people that were ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to flip into the new regulations were just
growing scaled up trash yeah and i felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like we didn't have good weed for a couple
years and it was so hard though because
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing is is the product would sit on
the shelf for so long or it would sit in
[SPEAKER_02]: some some warehouse somewhere as everyone
tried to figure out metric yeah people
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out metric and some of my
favorite brands like pre uh pre-rec when
[SPEAKER_02]: they went into rec it's like all of a
sudden their product is shit now and i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like how is this impossible you've always
been amazing what the hell happened you
[SPEAKER_02]: were so like you were the one and i'm not
going to name any names because i feel so
[SPEAKER_02]: bad because it was like my favorite
product in 2017 come 2018 2019 you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the shelves and i went to go buy it and
i'm like i can't believe this is the same
[SPEAKER_02]: company and it's not really their fault
because it was so difficult to navigate
[SPEAKER_02]: and props to them for for trying and doing
it you know what i mean it's like but
[SPEAKER_02]: there was so many things to navigate with
metric and it wasn't easy a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff with metric was these companies with
lots of money they were the first ones to
[SPEAKER_02]: the table because they had so much money
and so then they have this product out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that's shit or they acquire brands
so you know that that happened a lot too
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're not going to hire the head
grower what they should lose the head
[SPEAKER_01]: grower and then destroy the brand because
you have some amateur and they're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to follow a formula oh yeah some guy from
uh wherever that like had a had a garage
[SPEAKER_02]: girl that's now in charge of 300 lights or
whatever i've seen a lot of that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that yeah scary but it's gotten so much
better like i really the past two years in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular the top shelf has just gotten
so much better like fig has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: fig but they're amazing is great dude you
can't go wrong up north uh since i mean i
[SPEAKER_01]: love though that cluster of brands and
there's like ember valley there's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: many good top shelf brands i do i remember
distinctly like right in the beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: covid it was just like i was like had to
who am i going to buy what am i going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to find anything on the shelves i
mean i didn't need to be in the store
[SPEAKER_01]: because i have a bunch of friends that
grow but i still like i still like the
[SPEAKER_01]: retail experience i still want to know
what's current and i just i like that that
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it and it was like slim pickings
for a while where now it's like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a glut of good stuff and then
there's in the mids there's good mids i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean i really love midzotics i mean he's
crazy i love that dude i mean that's wild
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah the product's good for the dollar you
know and what it is and he's not he's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to be authentic in his own way and
he is he's 100 like i've told him because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've done events where he's been at the
same event like i will do any event that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at because you come with so much
energy and you don't care you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: your name out there he believes in his
product right yeah i love that the car
[SPEAKER_02]: like yeah yeah i love all the all the
little branded stuff i love that he's my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite every time i see him i give him a
big hug and i'm like okay this is where i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be i love him i love the rise of
the lounges like i said instead of doing
[SPEAKER_02]: demos i can't wait for the lounges in the
next year they're going to pop up
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere right so finally we can have
smoking lounges if you guys don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: california just recently passed the law
that is going to allow smoking lounges
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's about time we've had some the
cafe part yeah the part where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually sell food and make money yeah i
mean i think that's going to be a big game
[SPEAKER_02]: changer for california you know we've had
like there's there's a couple in san
[SPEAKER_02]: francisco smoking lounges i go to oakland
is yet to get some oakland has rooted in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 510 oh yeah you're right on temescal
they actually have the biggest lounge in
[SPEAKER_01]: northern california period is is fucking
huge it's still being built out so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more big than it is uh ready to go
and um and urbana in oakland is opening up
[SPEAKER_01]: uh in a couple weeks and that will have a
really nice lounge area but yeah i go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the city i go to mowgreens i go to i just
anywhere there's a lounge like i swear i
[SPEAKER_01]: want my product to be because i'd rather
do a demo there and actually be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: share things with people old school urban
farm we had epic demos uh but um dab bars
[SPEAKER_02]: going on there and it was just fun the
deli style with the tooth the chop sticks
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i mean the deli style with the chop
sticks was the way to be able to pick your
[SPEAKER_01]: bud yeah where you can actually look at
the bud yeah what was it i think it was uh
[SPEAKER_01]: the divinity tree is some club that was
back in the day in san francisco i used to
[SPEAKER_01]: go and i was oh it was the and there was
like all the experience and all the eggs
[SPEAKER_01]: were like four grams or whatever they
didn't miss over it's fine you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: take it here take this gummy to go or take
this this is the old the old stuff the
[SPEAKER_01]: good stuff i love that but i just love the
industry in general i don't like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: bad things about it but again i like this
that there's more access than ever and if
[SPEAKER_01]: we could just stop locking people up and
getting free the people that's half the
[SPEAKER_02]: battle you know because it's just not
right no matter how you look at it you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what however you feel about
legalization the most important part is
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're not locking people up uh we're
not locking users up especially it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so crazy to think that for the last
40 years we've been putting people in jail
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis for a plan for a plan that
only makes the world a better place in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion yeah absolutely you know it's
really sad and it's sad that how much that
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation has gone away again now that
we're in 60 prop 64 we're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational era it's all about making
money making money and then a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation of those who have been around
for a while is just we're going out of
[SPEAKER_01]: business how do we stay afloat but how do
how do we deal with the fact that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still people being locked up there's still
people going to prison over having a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple plants right it's not good yeah
it's a strange world we live in you know i
[SPEAKER_02]: think a lot of this stuff is backwards you
know but we're at wild times yeah good
[SPEAKER_02]: times post-covid good times there's
there's good times and there's good if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look in every single situation there's
there is some good well i love the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: rise of the new new cannabis media yeah
like this podcast first smoke of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these others all these other
podcasts there's stuff going on on twitch
[SPEAKER_01]: that i can't keep up with and i don't know
what the hell is going on with tiktok i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: too old to know but i just love the idea
that people are using media to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: push different messages and create
community in that way because i feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of lounges it's hard to create
community but the spaces like this are a
[SPEAKER_02]: place to create community that's really
awesome well and we're we're able to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: a story that's so much bigger than
ourselves it's one thing if i was to write
[SPEAKER_02]: my story yeah but now we're on episode 80
something right and so going in on episode
[SPEAKER_02]: 80 something uh we have this story that's
told by 80 other people and if we go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand someday which i hope we do of
course you will keep knocking them out
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine a thousand different stories over
time and and the impact that that
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially has on the future yeah which i
think to me that's kind of what it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: about i enjoy sitting here talking to
everybody but it's like uh we're telling a
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger story yeah you know and it's what
i'm getting your perspective today and the
[SPEAKER_02]: next we got maya from home and then we got
this person here who's a works in genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and so we get these different
stories about the industry and it really
[SPEAKER_02]: paints the true picture of what's going on
because with the media as a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: know uh we're given one story whether it's
agenda based uh or whatever but it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective of somebody who has one
opinion right whereas you can go and watch
[SPEAKER_02]: podcasts and then you can align with
different people and their stories and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can kind of pick an choose what you want
to hear but it's all for the most part
[SPEAKER_01]: authentic well i think it's important
because it's like there's so many brands
[SPEAKER_01]: out there they're just kind of faceless
and there's brands out there that like i
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize that name but i really don't
know who that's who that person is i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that their story but once i'm able to
hear their stories like oh i want to
[SPEAKER_01]: support them like i want to be a part of
their movement because i hear where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're coming from like i love that
element of the podcast and just cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: media the ability to meet the farmer or
meet the people where this is coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: and really kind of have a better
appreciation of their story and again
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing these aren't faceless brands
these often most of these the good brands
[SPEAKER_01]: just there's a couple friends that kind of
got together because they like doing one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and they built this world around
them and they're worth supporting they're
[SPEAKER_02]: small business owners yeah you know in
california and it's not easy to be a small
[SPEAKER_02]: business owner in california it's very
difficult there you know we're taxed a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: heavier than other places uh the tax
burden is much higher uh but it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: it's difficult to be a small business
owner in general yeah it is it's tough
[SPEAKER_01]: it's tough you get very used to not paying
yourself much like i'm good at paying
[SPEAKER_01]: other people but not so great at paying
myself but i pat myself on the back yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly but what you need is less it's
like i just want this i want my baby to
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed i want this to get to the next
year and so it's easy you got to level up
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah it's easy not to do things for
yourself because i want this other thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to happen and so it's exciting
yeah one of the things i'm the most
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about is the farm to table model
of in the winery model where you get to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the grow uh whether it's indoor outdoor
greenhouse extract company and you get to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to the people that work for the
company and go on a tour potentially and
[SPEAKER_02]: get to try the product there yeah and i
feel like that's the one big thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're missing and it's slowly starting to
happen and it's it's just going to
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually snowball and it's just going to
be like the micro brew model or you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like laganitas you want to get you want to
get a sense of what the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be like in 10 years go get a
tour at laganitas because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: future it's really frustrating that we're
not there yet i've just i've had so many
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that had grows on wineries or next
to wineries you know i've uh there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: club in livermore that opened up recently
that like it's there's a winery on the
[SPEAKER_01]: same property yeah and so like you're at
the dispensary then you see this beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: winery and they hear about all the events
they have about the winery and like what
[SPEAKER_01]: are your events well you can come hang out
you know just but you can't smoke you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't consume but we can go to a winery
and do all that and it's like as if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not so much more dangerous to go somewhere
drive somewhere drink and then drive away
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean if you can if we can justify that
activity and say that we created safety
[SPEAKER_01]: measures around that we can certainly do
that around cannabis and i think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: again that's a way to save small mom and
part farms there's a bunch of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have small pieces of property where they
love to be part of a network of small
[SPEAKER_01]: farms where people could come visit them
on sundays and see how they're operating
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it directly from the farm and have
that relationship because it's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: better when you know the person is either
growing your food or your cannabis having
[SPEAKER_02]: that direct one-on-one it's the best
totally are you guys planning on expanding
[SPEAKER_02]: to other states you guys just really
focusing on i like to expand to other
[SPEAKER_01]: states so this has been the conversation i
mean for those of you don't know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to succeed in california you get out
of california um like every everyone that
[SPEAKER_01]: i've talked to the only way to stay
solvent is to have a presence in another
[SPEAKER_01]: state california you can build your name
you can learn you can be part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture but if you actually need to make
money you need to go somewhere else so
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been talking about that we've been
really slow with it just because we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere near where we want to be in
california this last two years have been
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely difficult for us and i feel
super lucky to still be here but i have
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to some people back east um talk to
um some people in vegas too actually like
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm not a vegas person but even before the
raiders went to vegas there was always a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge oakland contingent in vegas and
people would always send me pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: our stickers like around vegas randomly
like oh that's cute and then um now that
[SPEAKER_01]: the raiders are there there's even more
serious and i went out to mj biz a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago and it was interesting like the
dispensary owners who have the option to
[SPEAKER_01]: open lounges were like not sure what to do
with it yeah they're like i have i talked
[SPEAKER_01]: to this one guy it's some policy thing
he's like i don't even know if i want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it it's like are you fucking kidding if
you don't want to have a lounge in vegas
[SPEAKER_01]: like like but they didn't they kind of
didn't see all the what could be done with
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then we have so much experience
here in california it'd be crazy not to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to take out to the rest of the country
and do things out the rest of the country
[SPEAKER_01]: and so i'd love to eventually be able to
do that but um we got to shore up our
[SPEAKER_01]: current business we do a lot of have a lot
of cartridges sell a lot of cartridges
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably like 85 percent of our
business currently um we've always had
[SPEAKER_01]: live residents jars we've gotten into
rosin recently and then we're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into edibles and i really want to launch
edibles here and get that going sooner
[SPEAKER_01]: than later and then kind of branch out to
other states um i love to do a beverage
[SPEAKER_01]: and i think beverages will work better in
other states as well i'm excited about
[SPEAKER_02]: beverages i just love the beverage model
too yeah i'm just excited but there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much additional product development that
we're that's going to be able to happen or
[SPEAKER_01]: not it happened we have the product
development we just so as the market
[SPEAKER_01]: expands there'll be more opportunity to
create niche products and so things that
[SPEAKER_01]: can't necessarily survive in a brutal
market like here but can survive across
[SPEAKER_01]: through like state lines and people are
shipping things i'm i'm talking to brands
[SPEAKER_01]: are like with the hemp thing it's just
like it's crazy to me i'm like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what like you're you're making what
selling it in tennessee it's just oh texas
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i see all over yeah i mean we're
talking to a company out of tennessee flow
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens he was just on the podcast uh
getting our product out so that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: basically he will be our cultivation
partner and doing it as hemp yeah and i
[SPEAKER_02]: think that's a it's a great thing it's a
beautiful thing it's this beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: loophole and you know and it's great
because access is important i think and
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly like when i the reason i like
going to mj biz or just other events like
[SPEAKER_01]: that is talking to people in other states
because they're so excited yeah like here
[SPEAKER_01]: we're kind of jaded we're exhausted we're
burnt out and you talk to people i talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys from jersey they made me want
to move to jersey they were so excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about opening their club they had all
these plans that may or may not work but
[SPEAKER_01]: just the excitement that they had and it
was like i would love to be able to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that again and be a part of something like
that again so that's part of the drive to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to out of state is just to be around
people who have that level of excitement
[SPEAKER_02]: and energy around it i think they only had
six licenses in jersey originally yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah we might have been talking to the
same group so yeah i was talking to some
[SPEAKER_01]: strange characters but um but a lot of
that really comes from being part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: equity trade network uh this one the
distro is a distribution center i work
[SPEAKER_01]: with equity trade distro is a distro
that's made up of a bunch of small equity
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses and some legacy businesses as
well and they've kind of gone national so
[SPEAKER_01]: now they kind of have a national trademark
that's they're kind of collecting equity
[SPEAKER_01]: brands from around the country under this
one umbrella and through them i've been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to meet all these people in these
different states and it's been really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting because our um the cannabis in
the black community is accepted and not at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time i mean a lot of folks
obviously are in my community are involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis industry but there's still
a lot of reticence because of the war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs i know that was my parents were
against me being in cannabis and i've met
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of other folks who are their family
are having issues around that same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: so the idea of being able to work with
other folks that kind of look like you and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work together has been like really
advantageous and it's been a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity and so the folks i've met in
jersey were folks that had access to
[SPEAKER_01]: equity licenses out there and they're
trying to figure out how to actually get
[SPEAKER_01]: it off the ground and there's so many of
the equity businesses particularly the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones in la they didn't have the best
partners and the partners made bad
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions for them and so those clubs are
really really struggling and then seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: like just simple little advice you can
give people can go a long way so i'd love
[SPEAKER_01]: the opportunity through the equity trade
network to kind of work with these other
[SPEAKER_01]: brands in other parts of the country and
just trying to share the knowledge that we
[SPEAKER_01]: do have so we can kind of all work
together which is that 's where the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast came from the coloring the color
in cannabis podcast which i should
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be able to say a little bit
easier i've been working on for the past
[SPEAKER_01]: year and the idea behind the podcast was
just interviewing other just folks from
[SPEAKER_01]: different communities about their
experience in cannabis i think because so
[SPEAKER_01]: many of my friends like have like a bunch
of arab friends and they're the pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: they were under from their family looks
very different than my asian friends or
[SPEAKER_01]: looks very different than some of my white
friends like each community kind of has
[SPEAKER_01]: their own relationship to cannabis i have
a friend that's a her family's from
[SPEAKER_01]: nicaragua and they're like they're not
tripping about the plant it's just a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to them it's a plant it's plant medicine
it's recreational whatever it is there
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a judgment attached to it whereas my
persian friend it's haram i mean it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: this heavy shit within his family about
this being a sin and um and so the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to have all these different
people from these different backgrounds
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of tell their stories and talk about
how their entrance into cannabis how their
[SPEAKER_01]: family and their their background their
ethnic background has impacted that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been kind of really interesting and then i
agree with what you're saying about the
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to people hearing all these
different stories and how it gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: such a fuller view of kind of what you're
doing and the connections with other
[SPEAKER_01]: people and it's just completely inspired
my business re-inspired my business this
[SPEAKER_01]: past year working on the podcast it's
again talking to people where they're so
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about their corner of the industry
and you're like yeah i do like it over
[SPEAKER_01]: here i don't want to do more of this and
so that's that's been really a lot of fun
[SPEAKER_02]: i get re-inspired weekly you know guys
like yourself coming on the show it's
[SPEAKER_02]: always great and you're so you're on
episode number 10 yeah yeah we just we
[SPEAKER_01]: just launched or this released episode 10
uh last week it's going to be the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: season one we have kind of season two
lined up have 10 more guests we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: interview and i have another podcast
that's that's not just about this it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a broader talking to kind of
everyone i know in the industry kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and i'm more excited kind of about
creating content and media around cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: than maybe just selling a product right
now selling a product is really tough and
[SPEAKER_01]: i've talked to so many people in other
parts of the country who just have no idea
[SPEAKER_01]: how any of this works and there's a hunger
to know and again mj biz is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that kind of really highlighted
that to me this things that we kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: take for granted we're in california like
everyone knows these things but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to these people in different states
or in different countries they like they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the experience that we have
they haven't seen 50 other businesses fail
[SPEAKER_01]: going down the same road so that we do
have something that's really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: share with all these other people and then
again there's a hunger to know and so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been really exciting being able to offer
that or deliver that and just get to know
[SPEAKER_01]: people better and now i'm talking to
people on the other side of the country
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've been watching it it's just
increased the conversations i've had in
[SPEAKER_01]: the network i've been having so it's been
it's been amazing you got to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: spandibus got a good mary jane i want to
go to spandibus so bad like i've been to
[SPEAKER_01]: spain separately when i was younger and i
love spain i love traveling in general and
[SPEAKER_01]: going to spain i went to barcelona 10
years ago and it was one of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences of my life 10 years ago was
the best time to go i just want to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: spandibus i just i just want to see i mean
i want to go to the conference in germany
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah that's mary jane so yeah i've
got friends i see these pictures i'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck i love being in spaces where the
english isn't the primary language spoken
[SPEAKER_01]: and i'd love to be able to do that around
cannabis like just be it's it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful that we can do that you know
it's like because because it's the one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that brings us together and people
from all different walks of life getting
[SPEAKER_02]: together around a plant yeah and having
that same conversation because they love
[SPEAKER_01]: the planet i i well i have several times i
have some friends in in the device space
[SPEAKER_01]: and i've often been like maybe i should
just get a job with you because you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: get to go everywhere you guys get to do
all the cool stuff and i'm stuck here in
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking california i love california but
like i want to go to germany i want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to argentina there's all these amazing
places to go so just in brazil yeah but
[SPEAKER_01]: again that's actually part of the
motivation with that podcast too is
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing that there's all these amazing
stories here but around the world i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is a multicultural activity and
i'd love to talk to people in thailand
[SPEAKER_01]: about what their relationship to cannabis
is and people have been farming like
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple generations in other countries
and what that looks like india that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: home of it you know i mean i'd be able to
see something that far back i very um i
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy indian culture i appreciate indian
culture i went to buddhist school for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time and so like i really resonate
with a lot of things are happening over
[SPEAKER_01]: there and so i'd love to actually be able
to try like the native products and just
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to try like like real hash and
like real cannabis and just uh bong the
[SPEAKER_01]: drink that they make on the road the road
is pronounced bang bang bang b-b-h-a-n-g
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i've always wanted to try like the
real version of that oh i've had some and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's wild yeah i bet beyond bomb extracts
it's so funny how everything comes full
[SPEAKER_02]: circle but the guy from beyond bomb good
friend he used to make the craziest bang
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's okay yeah you like fat and yeah
yeah that's how you get it man yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll get you good yeah it's sneaking out
of i miss i miss tainted i was just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to somebody about mickey martin
the other day and just all the old school
[SPEAKER_02]: products and just him yeah tainted and
beyond bomb are the two big companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that are off the you know i think
2005 they were done that's sad but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know trailblazers often trailblazers
pushing them yeah someone has to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah they do and they do good work and so
i'm just excited about where things are
[SPEAKER_01]: going i um excited about new products yeah
excited to be in the space yeah i mean
[SPEAKER_02]: it's exciting times and you know when it's
volatile is when it's exciting yeah you
[SPEAKER_02]: know once it stabilizes it's not going to
be it'll be exciting in other ways but the
[SPEAKER_01]: volatility yeah well that's where the real
money is i think if you want to make a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of money you go into that state that has
an emerging market and you just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: explode in there and be the risk taker but
we both know a lot of people who were that
[SPEAKER_01]: person they went to jail like i know
several people and it's really it's uh
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like i like opportunity but i don't
like the sound of federal prison no we've
[SPEAKER_02]: had we've had luke scarmazzo yeah rich
dalisi yeah uncle rick and you know uncle
[SPEAKER_02]: rick did 32 years for a plant yeah that's
insane that's insane substantial evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i have one of the guys i talked to
jason uh washington who owns plants over
[SPEAKER_01]: pills he um he was in montana had a bunch
of dispensaries was legal successful doing
[SPEAKER_01]: really well the feds didn't like him over
in that space doing that and he um they
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to give him 20 years and he fought
it and he fought it and got out he got i
[SPEAKER_01]: think got off for like six months which is
indeed that hasn't ever happened with the
[SPEAKER_01]: feds but just um but just talking to him
and evelyn both people have interviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: and hearing how they were doing everything
right and then you still wind up in jail
[SPEAKER_01]: like i don't think people realize when
they hear about like how important
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization is that it's not just
like some street dealer that got busted
[SPEAKER_01]: doing something they shouldn't have been
doing people have done everything right
[SPEAKER_01]: and they still get persecuted by the feds
and they still wind up going to prison and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just just not right yeah we live in a
backwards world in a lot of ways yeah but
[SPEAKER_02]: there's there's time for change and then
we're here now i mean like yeah you know i
[SPEAKER_01]: remember like hearing about don't drive
through texas because in that case with
[SPEAKER_01]: one seed you're going to i'm saying i
would be in jail for the next thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: years over here so i'm just seeing like
and i love all the seeing all these brands
[SPEAKER_01]: like i'm familiar with so many people up
here yeah love them to death i was second
[SPEAKER_01]: graduating class out of oakster dam profit
loops my peeps love david downs with hash
[SPEAKER_01]: with just the idea that all of these
things can be successful and thriving in
[SPEAKER_01]: this but not all thriving but that we can
be here and be doing this be working with
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant it's an amazing treat i just
love it so you got some extracts here
[SPEAKER_02]: today i think we got to try some of your
extracts you can try some of the stuff i
[SPEAKER_01]: got here we got all kinds of good stuff
all right i have i brought some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: suave some live rosin that we just did um
i wasn't thinking when i left and then
[SPEAKER_01]: something oh i should have product with me
so i there's not a lot in there and um and
[SPEAKER_01]: then i just brought i had some random
stuff around the house but i have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: goodies i've been working with uh the
folks at kalia recently and so i've been
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some goodies from mark up there
that's actually where we got our rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: from recently and then we're gonna we're
we're thinking about opening up
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing from different places i've
always wanted trying to have his hand on
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of a thing but the opportunity to
get things from kalia is like unbelievable
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fact that mark and his team have
been so generous with just here this is
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing you're thinking people like it and
giving it to us at a number that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: still deliver it at our normal like super
cheap price is fucking awesome right and
[SPEAKER_02]: so um i still like good vhl i i'm sorry uh
but really good uh you know live resin
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah good bho is phenomenal just most
people haven't had it yeah exactly at
[SPEAKER_01]: various points i because the market for
it's crumbled because there's cured resin
[SPEAKER_01]: which is cheaper and whatever and so i
keep thinking about like not not putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out live resin anymore at all just because
we're competing against people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it for five dollars a gram like
what are we really doing oh yeah but then
[SPEAKER_01]: every once in a while i'll run into
someone and it'll be like oh my god that's
[SPEAKER_01]: so good that's that's why we we got
excited about this thing right like i for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while i thought it was it was the fact
that every thing was coming through the
[SPEAKER_01]: closed loop systems and maybe the closed
loop systems couldn't replicate open
[SPEAKER_01]: blasting but recently from mark he gave me
some live resin that i would have swore
[SPEAKER_01]: was rosin like there's no way that that
was that was bhl so terpy it would and it
[SPEAKER_01]: does so 100 the plant like 100 the plant
and it was kind of creamy and shit i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like what are you guys doing but they
tweaked the machines they're doing us some
[SPEAKER_01]: other alchemy in the back and so anytime i
think i don't like a class of products
[SPEAKER_01]: like backup weight could actually do that
with it happens with rosin all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: because i like flour like smoking joints
i'm about to tell you and i have a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: of mine jess she's a buyer at pharmacy
she's like are you dabbing i'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking dad i'm smoking my joint it's like
shut up taryn and she'll put something in
[SPEAKER_01]: my little rig and i'll be like okay you're
right i forgot how good it can really be
[SPEAKER_01]: oh yeah let's be reminded yeah candy yeah
jesus here's some of the white thorns i
[SPEAKER_01]: got some of that from mark the other day
my absolute favorite all right so so i got
[SPEAKER_02]: an idea with the white thorn for cream
soda would be amazing yeah and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: second i think that something isn't good
they figure out how to make it better it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter whether led lights i can't
believe that shit's working i mean because
[SPEAKER_01]: i used i used to grow 10 years ago and led
lights were a joke and they someone would
[SPEAKER_02]: always come around right so the blurples
sucked yeah and we've come a long way
[SPEAKER_02]: since the blurples uh big shout out to all
these lighting companies you know i think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's 80 big lighting companies or i
wouldn't say big but there's 80 lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and there's only four factories
or something like that but yeah led has
[SPEAKER_02]: come a long way spectrum tuning now you
can dial in your own spectrum you can
[SPEAKER_02]: screw up your plants that way too which is
a great way to screw up your plants having
[SPEAKER_01]: to relearn from scratch oh yeah okay so
you're asking about my my temps so 451 is
[SPEAKER_01]: my low temp that i do for really really
nice rosin yeah 475 is my general use and
[SPEAKER_01]: then i do 531 because that's what roger
does and everyone so if i'm doing diamonds
[SPEAKER_01]: i'll do 550 but again that's just for this
device on my focus v at home i think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: at 375 or four something really really low
on the one on it at home we have to get
[SPEAKER_01]: roger on here to explain all this yeah
yeah i i wish we could just get all the
[SPEAKER_01]: device guys together in one room just talk
about all these devices at one time
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no egos there yeah these
are such great toys but like shit like
[SPEAKER_01]: this works well and this doesn't can't we
just all but whatever we're getting there
[SPEAKER_02]: and everybody's got their own version of a
saber you know puff goes got their pen
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah yeah i mean they've got one for focus
v dip device has their own version i love
[SPEAKER_01]: all these little i love the light on the
saber i love the light on the saber the
[SPEAKER_01]: hot knife is convenient you know honestly
like because i do dab bars and i have
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's equipment i know everyone i
have a lot of equipment at home i buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of stuff people will give me stuff
yeah do that white thorn is good yeah so
[SPEAKER_01]: is that skittles yep it's funny like
there's a reason why the popular things
[SPEAKER_01]: are so popular right it's easy to turn
your nose up like if you're like blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams classic blue dream really good blue
dream will sit you down and shut you up
[SPEAKER_01]: just shut up i mean you've had it 10
million times but enjoyed really good blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream but i mean i used to there's a time
where i sold blue dream to harborside i
[SPEAKER_02]: sold it yeah harborside pcc uh purple
heart there live all those places yeah rip
[SPEAKER_02]: purple heart yeah that would be a great
place you know i was like keep thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: he's gonna come back keith man come back
we miss you keith i'm telling you they had
[SPEAKER_02]: something special there and i feel like
they were this small little hole in the
[SPEAKER_02]: wall place with tons of passion like real
passion real good medicine real good
[SPEAKER_02]: product they like my product so it was
always but but just really good people uh
[SPEAKER_02]: you know in in the bay area we just had
some you know even even the guys over uh
[SPEAKER_02]: at bpg you know i mean they were really
passionate about the plant it's like i
[SPEAKER_01]: love i miss their old location when they
had their lounge they had the first little
[SPEAKER_01]: lounge i went into i still go over there a
lot to the um the bpg they still take good
[SPEAKER_02]: care of me and then um that was the one
with the yeah the driveway and then i
[SPEAKER_01]: still go to cbcb i mean like beyond just
like as a someone's selling product yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: each club has some great cbcb has some
great prices on them the outdoor that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in their house outdoor phenomenal
and it's like it's just pennies you know
[SPEAKER_02]: pcc had top shelf that was unmatched back
in the day eric and dave yeah they're gone
[SPEAKER_02]: they sold but uh dude the the product at
pcc was phenomenal telegraph that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: great telegraph spot the hat shops right
there so you should get the hat go get
[SPEAKER_01]: some freaking i i spent a lot of time in
there because i knew those folks and they
[SPEAKER_01]: um is again is one of the when we first
started it was like one of our first five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six accounts and then like uh the
telegraph health center thc when they were
[SPEAKER_01]: there i mean just but this is a network of
old clubs people were so dedicated and
[SPEAKER_01]: they spent so much time and energy and it
was a time of such fear you're worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about the feds coming in you're getting
robbed like you didn't know what was going
[SPEAKER_01]: on right the people were pioneers and i
just really appreciate them well and
[SPEAKER_02]: people think of quality being like it is
today like the quality this quality that
[SPEAKER_02]: but back in the day there was some fire
yeah like some really special stuff too
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff where you would only see it one
time in your life we had some stuff called
[SPEAKER_02]: the spaceship that we had for a while that
was really really phenomenal and the
[SPEAKER_02]: shaman okay the shaman and in fact the
shaman was one of the things that really
[SPEAKER_02]: got me excited about breeding because my
friend bred the shaman it was a shaman it
[SPEAKER_02]: should have been called the shaman because
it was a shaman times the romulan back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the shaman there's a back cross and it was
just so good and it was purple and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: strong and it was heady and it was terpy
but yeah red congo batter or red congo oil
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point it's been around way too
long but anything congo we hold on to it
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's stuff that i would put in my
freezer you know i have a little freezer
[SPEAKER_02]: stash and that has i don't know a few
different cats we got we got jars in there
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah oh wow i love the conga i love the
conga this smells like tree sap it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: good it's got its own unique and those
things have their it's not like the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenaline limonene or terpenaline
limonene that most people think of as haze
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it's got its own funk like real
good durban it wasn't super hazy it was
[SPEAKER_02]: real funky and musky and you know it had
its own thing with like the anise in it
[SPEAKER_01]: the current one is really do like i love
durban it's one of my favorite strains but
[SPEAKER_01]: like i know the durban i'm smoking now is
not the durban that i smoked like 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago no same thing with lamb's bread like i
don't see it that often and but lamb's
[SPEAKER_02]: bread is the most unique thing though it's
it's a that's a musky one right i feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like lamb's bread is extremely musky it's
funky and musky almost cheesy but yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely it's almost cheesy for sure and
the real one it's like i've smelled it in
[SPEAKER_02]: other other people's crosses where they
have that expression in the nose where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like oof lamb's bread uh shane
sunny chiba my my buddy he was at
[SPEAKER_02]: harborside and he they were fino hunting
20 000 plants and he took me over to the
[SPEAKER_02]: lamb's bread crosses and they all smelled
like lamb's bread like they had that
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct musky nose funkiness like it you
know it's like and it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe if you've never smelled it but
it's one of those things if you smelled it
[SPEAKER_02]: and you smell it again you'll remember
that the rest of your life yeah i miss
[SPEAKER_01]: that i feel like just the way the advent
of purples really kind of hurt indica's in
[SPEAKER_01]: general because people started obsessing
about color yeah i feel like uh the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing has happened with this candy gas
obsession like it's great but it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're losing so many things because that's
the wave and again as quickly as i say
[SPEAKER_01]: that i will admit every single time
somebody hands me a lemon cherry gelato
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm like damn that tastes good so i'm
embarrassed just like the white thorn i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: embarrassed that i'd like something like
that's so common so pedestrian but the
[SPEAKER_01]: great flavor profiles are great for a
reason well it's funny because if the if
[SPEAKER_02]: white thorn wasn't popular you would still
like it the same oh yeah for sure i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: care yeah take me with lcg yes i don't
care what you call it i just like it yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: sunset sherbert some people are like
hating on sunset sherbert last week and
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm like dude how can you hate on like
real good sunset sherbert i think they
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't had it i feel like you don't know
what you're talking about if if you hate
[SPEAKER_02]: on sunset sherbert like it it never gets
day but it's just as good if not better i
[SPEAKER_02]: like it better than the gelatos but it's
its own unique thing and it's like really
[SPEAKER_02]: good fucking sunset sherbert is some of
the best stuff out there yeah and it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's grower by grower is batch by
batch i think when people i hear people
[SPEAKER_01]: hate on a classic i just like you probably
haven't had the real version like you had
[SPEAKER_02]: some water down bs where jack i get hating
on jack because so much bad jack went
[SPEAKER_02]: around but if you only think jack is like
something that's very linear you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: get really good jack because the jack back
in the day was strong complex had amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor but it's not the jack that most
people think of as jack today and i think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many things like a train wreck
real train wreck is phenomenal yeah that's
[SPEAKER_01]: strong real train wreck that's one of the
few strains where i've smoked it where i
[SPEAKER_01]: was like too strong like i had to put it
down and kind of relax a little bit like
[SPEAKER_01]: the true version like there's a reason why
it was called train wreck but people think
[SPEAKER_01]: these things are games like a real ak-47
would do something to you and people just
[SPEAKER_01]: again they got the watered down version of
it and they don't know the real expression
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah i like a lot of the old stuff i just
it's you don't see people growing it to
[SPEAKER_02]: the full capability and i feel like people
aren't pushing it as hard as i used to and
[SPEAKER_02]: there was there was more of it but i feel
like there was also less growers and there
[SPEAKER_02]: was more passionate people it was illegal
for one thing you're taking big risks and
[SPEAKER_02]: so you had to have bigger balls yeah and
also there was mids back then yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely there was absolutely you know
besides the mexican there was people that
[SPEAKER_02]: grew mids that thought it was amazing a
lot everyone thought there was yeah i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like not everything but so much
of what came out of bc for us was meds
[SPEAKER_01]: although i was when i lived in seattle i
had phenomenal things coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: vancouver that would just melt your face i
love them by the time you get it got down
[SPEAKER_01]: to here it was bc buds and it was just it
was a dirty word yeah it was a pound that
[SPEAKER_02]: was this big you can play football with it
you know it's not you know i i think they
[SPEAKER_02]: would smash it and they would use oh three
to get rid of this smell so it all smelled
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like hey yeah but that wasn't
necessarily the good stuff that was just
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that was floating around yeah i
would when i lived i lived i went to
[SPEAKER_01]: evergreen state college for my last year
of college last couple years of college
[SPEAKER_01]: and we spent a lot of time in seattle and
um i remember getting weed from people
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of like i guess like humble i'd
find people they'd sell you weed out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: duffel bag but it would be like phenomenal
it would be this phenomenal indoor i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know where the hell this shit came from
and they're just like stick your hand in
[SPEAKER_01]: and take whatever you want and i'm just
like i'm from oak and i'm like i'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking my hand in shit like i don't i
can't wrap my brain around this but we
[SPEAKER_01]: would get such amazing weed and it was
from these little weed nerds like i got
[SPEAKER_01]: weed up there that it i didn't i'm sorry
this is uh 97 98 99 there's weed that i
[SPEAKER_01]: got randomly from dudes at this this one
particular coffee shop in seattle that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably still not there anymore like and
it was better than anything i've had
[SPEAKER_01]: probably since i mean it was just
phenomenal i work in seattle i love
[SPEAKER_01]: seattle there's always been weed nerds up
there those kids are geniuses there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: shit supposedly the shit that came from
udub or whatever all those stories about
[SPEAKER_01]: all that nonsense and all that and all the
stuff coming down from alaska and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: stories about that and all that stuff it
was this phenomenal permafrost i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you remember permafrost from up
there but atf atf atf and then before is
[SPEAKER_01]: atf i mean when i first heard atf it was
mananuskin thunderfuck there was yeah they
[SPEAKER_02]: had both i think i remember alaskan first
but then i remember both the matanuska and
[SPEAKER_01]: the alaskan thunderfuck i wasn't sure what
came i just remember just like and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you found it and you're like okay this is
why this is a thing yeah seattle had good
[SPEAKER_02]: flour it was just really hard if you lived
in seattle and you were cultivating it was
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to keep your bud nice because of the
humidity and it was always super humid
[SPEAKER_02]: during the winter especially and i mean i
think there's summers are drier now than i
[SPEAKER_02]: think they typically were but higher
humidity environments it requires uh
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor trimming indoor uh basically
storage and then if you're like dispensing
[SPEAKER_02]: it you need to have some sort of bag or
seal on it and then every time you open
[SPEAKER_02]: the jar you got to shut it right away
otherwise your bud's gonna get soggy
[SPEAKER_02]: because it'll absorb all that moisture and
humidity plays a huge role in the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of your flour terpenes are volatile
they'll go away as soon as it gets humid
[SPEAKER_02]: again and you dry it out and then get it
humid it's even worse yeah i had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: wet weed up there not even just wet just
spongy too not dry exactly it wasn't dry
[SPEAKER_02]: and crispy it was just soft i think it was
pretty part of the it was part of like how
[SPEAKER_02]: it was it was just most people had spongy
flour they tried to roll a joint with it
[SPEAKER_01]: off the shitty little papers because there
wasn't a good paper selection back in the
