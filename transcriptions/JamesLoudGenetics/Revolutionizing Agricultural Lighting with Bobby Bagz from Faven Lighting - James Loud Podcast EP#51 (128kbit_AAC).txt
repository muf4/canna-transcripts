[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today our special guest is Tim,
also known as Bobby Bags from Fave and
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about doing this for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we met not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met at the, so at the Connected event
where you spoke and talked about your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your under canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really excited to hear that it
was a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard from other people that it
was a success and now we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: trialing them in our spot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm assuming it's going to be a great
success too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm going to go ahead and say it'll
probably be a smashing success here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, I'm excited to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the natural evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had friends that have been talking
about this for five years saying this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you that this is going to
change the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you did it and I'm like,
okay, so here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy Justin, he was talking about this
for years and you actually executed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the product is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as far as I've seen so far,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are even using two rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, one every foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about your
lights first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that the best place to
start is like where the need and like
[SPEAKER_00]: where the idea for Fave and came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I've been growing for
about 15 years now and 10 and like 10 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those, you know, somewhat of a large
scale, you know, I think scale gets
[SPEAKER_00]: redefined every like two to three years,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 700 lights two years ago was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 700 lights is a pretty standard
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, a couple of hoop houses in
2012, you were doing it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 lights in 2012, you were, you were
doing it, you know, so scale gets
[SPEAKER_00]: redefined, but, but you know, where the
under canopy really came from was,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I got a job at connected and alien
labs there in Sacramento and the head of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, um, a big ag, a previously big
ag, um, R and D just wizard, to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, I learned a lot from the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and one day he walks in and he's like,
all right, we're going to do under canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: trials and inter canopy trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I have so much to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to add this on my plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was not happy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be super, super honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like really not happy about it,
but then you see them and then you start
[SPEAKER_00]: turning them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it only takes a couple of days of
watching the plants sufficiently lit and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole different, you know, really kind of
reworking our idea of lighting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it only takes a few days and that's
kind of where it all spurred from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I worked from, I worked for
connected for a year and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time I get the chance, I shot them
out because they really gave me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a great launch pad for just
about everything in the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was very hard to break into legal
cannabis, you know, a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little easier now, but man,
you really had to know somebody to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into a facility back in 2020, you know,
and it was, it was tough going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, big shout out to connected for
really laying the foundation for a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful cultivation at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I learned so much in the year I was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, after I left, I kept pulling
the under canopy thread just because I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew something was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there really wasn't anybody on market
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think I told this story at the
talk you were at, but I walked into my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my partner's partner and Favin,
uh, his office and it was just a day where
[SPEAKER_00]: I was frustrated or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came in and I was just kind of
complaining about every product on market
[SPEAKER_00]: and how these companies with like some
kind of under canopy light were just,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get the big picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were lighting guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't understand anything about the
growing potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they didn't, they didn't understand
the skew as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so my partner just kind of looked
up from his computer, stale face just
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at me and was like, then do
something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like make your own, like you stop
complaining kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that day, you know, Favin was,
it was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, Favin was created out of
the need to provide growers with the right
[SPEAKER_00]: tool for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I am a grower first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still a grower first, like Favin takes
the majority of my week now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first thing I do when I get up in the
morning is check my graphs and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything watered, you know, so I'm very
much still in the throes of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, there was nothing that really was
there that could handle the rigors of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of scale cultivation, you know,
like putting a light underneath your,
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath your plants or they're subject
to water down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're subject to sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot, you know, it,
there was a lot that went into actually
[SPEAKER_00]: designing a light that fits into facility
workflows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we nailed it with Favin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the killer product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, that's where kind of where
it all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been, been working with Under
Canopy for about four years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, Favin's been selling lights for
since June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been 10 months, not even nine
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you guys hit the ground running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, we knew how to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew, we knew to get the product in
the hands of the right growers and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, bear up in Redding, a Golden State
bear canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favin Abiz was one of our first,
actually our first tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we knew he was going to tell us
if we were onto something or if we were
[SPEAKER_00]: faking the funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I got a call from him like
three weeks in and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: geez, like we have six more weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it already looks like a, like a
banger, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, we just, we,
we really hit the ground running and gosh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a whirlwind sense, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like you're super busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I see you're on the phone,
and it's always something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually, I actually have this week
was the first week that I felt like I had
[SPEAKER_00]: the team in place to really, really start
executing on the bigger, larger goals and
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger vision of Favin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it feels really good to get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let me tell you that like having the
right team around you can make everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the right team is everything,
you know, cause you can't do it all
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, but you need people that would
do the job if as good, if not better than
[SPEAKER_01]: you when they're doing it, you know,
they represent you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether, you know, if you're in a
cultivation facility, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: grower that, you know, but they're an
extension of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a team, you all work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fine tune machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that stuff makes me smile.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like building a business is a little scary
because I've never done it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I like, I'm not to repeat
myself again, but I've just been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just been growing, you know,
and I have a consulting business,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, that's me growing, you know,
it's way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's been a lot of learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very uncomfortable right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to learn to get more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you like getting kicked in the nuts
because that's what happens when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: a business and I'm going through some more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like waking up, getting kicked in the
nuts a couple of times and smiling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then knowing that tomorrow
you're probably gonna get kicked in the
[SPEAKER_01]: nuts again, but it's okay cause you got
your business and you know, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm sitting with James loud on
his podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's, it's an adventure and
there's a lot of unknown and there's stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're like, Oh, next time I do it,
I'll do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think distribution is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what you do, distribution is so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having those district doesn't matter how
good your product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you always want to focus on the
product, but really the distribution is
[SPEAKER_01]: just as important, if not more important
than the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a lot of mediocre shit that
sells.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying people should make mediocre
stuff, but I'm saying that they have good
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and mediocre stuff sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to, it would be very easy
for me to just dive into the unit at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times, but really I have to know that we
did a great job designing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through many iterations to get to
where we're at today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fully fleshed out product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a version one, two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our version, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will iterate in the future,
but smaller tweaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't have R and D samples going
out to customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fully fleshed out version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very easy to just keep diving.
[SPEAKER_00]: In and keep tweaking and keep tweaking,
but my, where I'm most needed is the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution channels and getting it in
the hands of growers and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really kind of breaking down that
barrier of under canopy seeming like a
[SPEAKER_00]: gimmick, you know, because it was kind of
a joke for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think with most things,
if you tell people I'm going to get 25%
[SPEAKER_01]: more yield, I'm going to get you 25% more
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to laugh at you,
you know, because we've heard it so many
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years, I've heard it time and
time and time again, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need 50% more, all these fictitious
numbers typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you came through with something that
actually gets you a bigger yield.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under canopy and Favin in particular is,
is the most revolutionary thing since,
[SPEAKER_00]: since the Taros 12, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since, you know, substrate monitoring came
out because we watched facility
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiencies, you know, increase so
substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: From like 2020 to 2022, you know,
just everybody got better at growing
[SPEAKER_00]: because we now could see inside in the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so under canopy is very much in that
same vein, where it is going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do not have this in your facility,
it is going to be extremely hard for you
[SPEAKER_00]: to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll cost you money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're going to leave it on the
table for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally leaving it on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, it's funny cause I remember,
you know, so I've been doing this awhile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and back in the, back in the
day, you know, I'm talking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties, two thousands, it was two pounds
of light was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I was growing cookies back in
the day, I would get three quarters of a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound per light with the, you know,
and that was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't good, but the prices were so
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now the prices are much lower and the,
the yields are much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, two pounds is like, eh,
you know, for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still people that are okay
with two pounds, but as a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator, two pounds is kind of rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at your cogs,
you know, look at what you're leaving on
[SPEAKER_01]: the table, looking at your potential and
we're talking about potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're talking yield potential,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yield potential without sacrificing
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, a lot of this is going
to, a lot of this podcast will be about
[SPEAKER_00]: yield potential and that, but really the
thing with under canopy and the thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: Favin and why it took us so long to get to
market and is because we prioritized the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the, of the extra yield as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just like, Hey, here's extra
yield because you can't, we can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: boof out our plants and expect it to sell
on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you went and focused on the problem
part of the plant, which is the smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people have tons of smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smalls are a big thing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are buying smalls left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to hate me real soon,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they realize the smalls are going
away.
Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how, so what kind of decrease do you
get in your smalls?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say industry standard, you know,
um, without under canopy, you're looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 20% is a acceptable run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think genetic to genetic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and we'll kind of leave genetic
variation out of the conversation because
[SPEAKER_00]: we won't get anything done if we talk
genetic to genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we're really looking for 5%
and really that 5% is they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just may not meet the size
requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're completely mature and THC
color uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just may not have the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a true small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no more green smalls,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's none of like, and it's in
sack where I'm based out of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: green smalls fetch a hundred to $200 less
per pound than purple smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking to revenue increase just
right there, you know, and then you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield and then you talk, you know,
the, the uniformity of bud in the a bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And anytime we talk yield or I talk yield,
I'm only talking about the bags that go at
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest price.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters right now is how
many bags go at the highest price from
[SPEAKER_00]: that room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because every grow is
different and some people too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, two pounds of light is,
is their minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like anytime two pounds of light comes
across the board on yield, they get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little nervous, you know, and three pounds
is where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, unfortunately yield is the
fastest and the easiest way to decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: your cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really unfortunate, but it's
where we are at in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really pinched the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like, I feel like a lot
of people in this industry can kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter how well the growers do,
they still have a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still make their margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's fine, but it's really,
really, those margins have compressed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers and you know, Favin is here to
really put that ball back in the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we really want this tool in the hands
of the growers so that they can expand
[SPEAKER_00]: their margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can, you know, hire the help they
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can live a comfortable life where
they should, you know, so instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers being squeezed now, like we're
really putting the power back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry has been very rough on
cultivators in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our margins have compressed a
lot or everybody else has kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained some kind of margin,
but cultivators have been absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: demolished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going back to, we are farmers now
and same thing with farmers of lettuce and
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get treated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I think using the platform
and using the tool, the under canopy tool,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really is going to bring back a lot of
power to the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so when you talk about quality,
what do you attribute that to?
[SPEAKER_01]: You attribute to the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sure there's many factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, you know, I think in spectrum is
a big one and that you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in genetics there, man,
you know, some, you know, crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some plants perform better at HPS
and some perform better under CMH and some
[SPEAKER_01]: led, you know, it's just, it's all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, so we kind of approached that
because, you know, HPS and LEDs are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not want to treat them the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And HPS very high and red, orange,
yellow, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to kind of strip that plant of
the excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of built up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier at least for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know other people have other insights
and instances, but you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easier for me to pull color
underneath an HPS bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most likely that has to do with being
able to strip that nitrogen out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we went to design the spectrum to
fit underneath, you know, an HPS top
[SPEAKER_00]: light, I really pulled back on my days of
mixing metal halides and HPS up top,
[SPEAKER_00]: checkerboarding those rooms and how terpy
and how just, how exceptional that weed
[SPEAKER_00]: was, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you just got a full spectrum there
for your plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbing, you know, just about
everything is fully represented in a mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is, is we really looked at
bringing in some full spectrum diodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we wanted to make sure that we still
took care of the farther red, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a nice balance of a little
more white light and definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: farther red, some 660, some 680,
make sure we're getting that pull out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, make sure we're there on the
color side of things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely with the top light LEDs,
I'm not a huge fan of how lacking in red,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the top light LEDs are,
you know, most they really, really
[SPEAKER_00]: underperform in the red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you look at a regular
chart that a lighting company puts out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like it has plenty of red,
but once you put it on your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just tell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of lacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And white spectrum is always going to
deliver a massive yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've, I think we've established that
like the wider your spectrum, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: full your spectrum, you're really,
really going to, you're going to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we kind of took that
lack of red and just reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put full red, almost full red into our
spectrum that's slated to go underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: the LED top lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cultivators will call me like week
seven and they're like, dude, my lowers
[SPEAKER_00]: are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: My tops are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're already on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually don't get this for another 10
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and, and you can just tell that
they're not only excited, they're relieved
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can, they know this product
is going to meet the demand that the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to have the extra yield
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to have the extra
yield, but, but the whole plant and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product is better top to bottom,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a lot of pride in the spectrum
balancing that we introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get conversations all the time when
people want to know the intricacies of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll, I'll geek on them with forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does your light effect stretching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how you irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, and we're actually not
coincidentally, not on purpose,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a side-by-side of one gallons and
two gallons with under canopy on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really tell that the plants in
the two gallons have a lot more resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more water availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can grow a lot more, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can kind of put on that extra size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for everybody still growing in one
gallons, cause we still, I do some
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in one gallons and some in two
gallons, some just don't root in that
[SPEAKER_00]: well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the, the one gallons, what we see is
they won't stretch as much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less resources available to them
and you can irrigate a little differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can give them what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all depends on substrate size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a bigger substrate,
that plant's going to keep going,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and then something else kind of on
that same vein is I see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: over irrigate a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say over watering is probably
the number one issue that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators have, um, especially novice
cultivators, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to just give your plants water,
you know, every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the book says to, you know,
and what under canopy does is it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: helps them dry out a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will call me all the time and
they're like, this is the best room I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had top to bottom, top Cola bottoms,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our charts are better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my head, I'm like, okay,
you probably were oversaturating just a
[SPEAKER_00]: touch, you know, a lot of Rockwell slab
guys that are like, oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like Coco kind of kind of dialed
in, but Rockwell slabs or Hugo guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I'd say it's about seven out of
10 times when I get that call.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Rockwell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly why it's kind of relative,
but we can talk about grams per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot or pounds per light, whatever,
whatever anybody wants to talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so that everybody understands
exactly what we're talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying we gave, you know,
this guy got a hundred percent yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was at one pound of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not, we're not, I'm not here to
fudge the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the product's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you attribute going from,
from two pounds to four pounds of light
[SPEAKER_01]: and then actually two pounds to three
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then three pounds to now potentially
touching four, maybe a little over four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think the big change was
originally?
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that basically monitoring dry
bags, basically crop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think crop steering is the, the easier
answer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely crop steering,
but it's just, you know, crop steering has
[SPEAKER_00]: been around for decades and big ag and
it's, and it's very much just finding its
[SPEAKER_00]: way into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're, I think we're finding the
boundaries of that very quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously genetic to genetic is
different, but when you're talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic, I'd say most genetics on a medium
run or about two and a half pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, you know, a medium good run where
cultivators are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't, weren't too many issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're two and a half right on a four by
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without under canopy steering and
understanding when to send those triggers
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you kind of start breaching
the consistency of two and a half and into
[SPEAKER_00]: the threes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic to genetic with under canopy,
you're adding light to your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to have a little bit
more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I mean, light and yield are
linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this isn't that it's not so much
rocket science either, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you do with that extra yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding, you know, 140 Watts,
two Favin bars per four by four to a four
[SPEAKER_00]: by four that had a thousand watt HPS above
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's about 25% extra light you're
adding right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's your 25% yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's your 25% yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's guaranteed,
but it's a pretty easy equation to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we get past 25%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now we're looking at where that
light is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is, is, is just actually
actioning a previously under utilized area
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom third of your plant,
that bottom third of your plant is good
[SPEAKER_00]: for genetic to genetic, but that that's
good for a yield increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really where under canopy shines
is when you can, and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: overarching goal of under canopy in
general, is getting the perfect mix of top
[SPEAKER_00]: and bottom light in the center of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the center of your plant holds the
highest yield potential by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's so many nodes going on
in there and so many, so much potential
[SPEAKER_00]: there that it usually just gets
overshadowed because you de-leaf yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's hard to know HPS drops off real
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not, it's pretty common for
me to walk into a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a walkthrough and talk about Favin
with them and I'll put a par meter in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it's 250.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, man, you can clone it to 50,
you know, like your plants need more if
[SPEAKER_00]: you expect them to do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, it, it really comes down
to where the light is and how well you
[SPEAKER_00]: manage that light and the mix of the top
and bottom light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, that's your, those are the two big
keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now things like thinning when you're
using an under canopy light, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: thin your recommend thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping, thinning, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there tips and tricks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I forget, I want to make sure
we have a ton of resources on our
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and our YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're putting out as much educational
content as we can around this just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, it's scary for a cultivator to kind
of dip their toes into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of us are,
are run to run right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have a bad run, you know,
can't afford to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that, that growers
feel very comfortable and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: verse, a very good first time experience
with Favin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when it comes to pruning,
please stop under clearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still get our lights and they still
under clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stripping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop it, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first run, don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, please just watch,
watch and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guarantee you will not have a bad
run because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reduce under clearing, stop under
clearing, but reducing under clearing
[SPEAKER_00]: really is allowing for all those node
sites underneath there to become
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that we usually would throw away
are now going to be extra yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be mature and they're
going to be cracked out and they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to fit in your bag just like the tops all
the way down to the soil or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and to be specific, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for bringing that up to be
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got your lights, you know,
flush with your pot, we like to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the put the Favin's the base of the
Favin flush with the top of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock will one gallon, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you know for sure that you're
not blasting your substrate with light
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a couple of people who are
like, you know, I grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: four to five foot plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually going to raise these up a
little higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you raise them up a little
higher than that, then go ahead and under
[SPEAKER_00]: clear underneath where that light isn't,
you know, making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, it's a lot of common
sensey stuff that we've been doing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, common sense isn't so common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a common thing that growers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why we put out all the
resources, because I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is a no brainer because I've been
using it for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of forget how scary it is to like
introduce a new technology like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It as a grower, you're like, yeah,
I'm not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot on my plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just trying to make it very easy
and approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing under clearing, which also
reduces labor, we can talk about labor
[SPEAKER_00]: savings later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reducing that labor is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategic de-leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, again, making sure you're
getting upward mobility of that light is
[SPEAKER_00]: key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually I tell people days three to
five, do a light, light de-leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: remove any of the little the little sucker
nodes at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a weird one that kind of
made it through the cloning process and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of coming out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, go ahead and take that guy off to,
you know, remove all the ones that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be anything, but leave the
majority of everything on on that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to five little light under clear
de-leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back in day between depends on who you
talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a week there where people like to
get in there or they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of guys are like, no,
we don't touch till 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are like, no, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in there at day 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're really just going in there,
pulling any of the huge fan leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are really impeding the upward mobility of
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really just trying to keep it open
in there and make sure there's decent
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't want it to be a jungle
underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you're really looking to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get to that point,
once you get to day 25 and a week for call
[SPEAKER_00]: it, let's just talk day 28, you kind of
know what's going to develop into a good
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can kind of see it because
the hairs are maturing and the bud is
[SPEAKER_00]: maturing at the same rate as the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been the lights have been on for
28 days, top and bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there, I kind of let growers take
over and do their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't let them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey, whatever your SOP is,
you can kind of continue from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I like to do a touch up
around day 40 and then a heavy strip for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that comes up a lot when
you're not under clearing anymore is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of congestion underneath in
your under canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we I'm not saying you have to do
this again, especially if you're on your
[SPEAKER_00]: first bench of under canopy, you're just
trialing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reducing plant count is one of the
biggest benefits you can do to really
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritize airflow in your under canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest benefits for yield
increase, like dropping plant count and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting every plant really optimize itself
is is probably the biggest takeaway we had
[SPEAKER_00]: from the first run at connected was just
like we slam from like 16 to nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're for if you're four plants wide,
you need to think about three plants wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even on a five by bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a four wide, four foot wide
bench and you've got four plants wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you definitely need to try just three
plants wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like that nine number 12
sometimes depending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some biscotti sure that doesn't like
that doesn't rage, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little higher plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love me some skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles with under canopy will tangent
this is skittles is so much better of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with under canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet it is just it is meant for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lateral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's branchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches are all like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about a lot of this show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a struggler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like you see it with under canopy
and you're like, oh, my God, this makes so
[SPEAKER_00]: much sense just because it's built for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nugs are already so light and
larfy, you know, smalls from skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you put some light underneath there
and tighten them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And skittles is commercially viable again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get some sticky skittles nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you can get a little bit of
color in there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody wants any color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you don't you give me skittles with
color on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you if it's real skittles and it
has a hint of color, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the all the property from proper
doings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff's faving grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, those guys, those guys,
they roll killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are they're killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they love they I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a text from from Paul or DM from
Paul a couple of times a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll just be like, I love faving,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get them on the show next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Adam and Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quick little drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's, you know, pruning is
pruning is so different cultivator to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we try to put out SOPs that are
very loose and malleable, I guess you
[SPEAKER_00]: could say, grower to grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what we put out the content
we put out were very comfortable with,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, if you follow these steps
within these steps, you will have success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your first run after your first run,
then start to tweak it to your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I talked to guys call me all
the time and they're like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to let me know how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's the deal is you just have to
let me know, you know, because now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limit your under clearing, like all that
is usable product, you will be shocked
[SPEAKER_00]: like G41.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a we've got some double stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amplified Farms has they were helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped us do our double stack trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put G41 on the top, top level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, I don't know how
G41 is going to do, but this will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week five, you were kind of in there like
that doesn't look like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I just defer by week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like, oh, my God, those are golf
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just it just set on so late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chunked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because G41 is one of those where it
doesn't have the super active hairs that
[SPEAKER_00]: that like the bud grows into.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're those kind of squirmy hairs that
stay inside the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just like kind of swells together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it doesn't look like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, oh, my goodness, I actually just
left there yesterday and they have G41 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same spot on the top deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, I was kind of worried
about this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Headgrower Zippy was like,
dude, you always worry about these runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they always come through, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one is the nested Brax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this the first time I was
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's it's a whole new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't change your workflow too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I have 700 life facilities in
Sacramento that have fully dropped their
[SPEAKER_00]: third party labor because they don't need
them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more under clear weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's labor is not cheap anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labor in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding good labor is the hardest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but labor is also one of your biggest
cogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot get around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything to lower labor, even 10
percent labor and taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn you, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your silent partner, the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, man, it's you know,
we're really just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really just and we have a ton of
things that we're monitoring and watching
[SPEAKER_00]: and really trying to put out some good
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good resources, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one light for HPS and you have one
light for LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they're different light
sources, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put light in either room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put spectrum in either room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really did that to balance out
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my big interest with your lights is
going to be the seed production room that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to do seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're monitoring what you get with the
faven and what you get without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like I'm looking forward to
seeing bigger yields in seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm already getting close to 50,000
seeds per light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we can break that 50,000
threshold per light, that's with
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's still that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can break that 50,000 seed threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeding was something that the 20
year old me when I got into cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how how long does it take to bring a
genetic to market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, I don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, a 60 day harvest is too
long for me to wait any minimum a year to
[SPEAKER_01]: get something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're and and the funky breeders out
there just kind of throwing seeds around
[SPEAKER_00]: and packs around like not vetted and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're talking about fully vetted
genetics that have tested genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of
bad players in the game these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it never was interesting to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just loved growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I never got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you and a couple of other
people have really kind of shined the
[SPEAKER_00]: light on what seed production can be with
under canopy and your issue being immature
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing that, you know, rosin guys deal
with immature trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you've become a solution to a
problem and that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inadvertently, I was just trying to
put out a good product for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people got it in their hands and
they're like, hey, you can do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this and this with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just the coolest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the coolest part to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so let's dive back into a little bit
of your history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when did you first start
enjoying the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't a big smoker growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the oldest of three boys,
kind of a single mom situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was kind of set in the tone,
you know, and I early on, my grandpa kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sat me down and was like, hey,
you're the man of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to kind of act like it,
you know, kind of thing like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so always kind of had to stay away from
that and set a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was as soon as I could,
I was working, you know, and I played 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18, 15 and a half, you know, as soon as I
could, as soon as it was legal and got my
[SPEAKER_01]: first job when I was 12 working for my
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I played sports, I played soccer
growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran track in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was always doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like, you know, canvas was
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Cali in high school and whatever,
you know, literally it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just like, you know, I think I had
a joint at a party my junior year and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, I hit the joint and I
passed it back and they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people were like, Tim smoked,
you know, but it didn't do anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I didn't really get into it
until I think senior year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got high after watching Harold and
Kumar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, after though,
people think that's funny that I got high
[SPEAKER_00]: after watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seemed like so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I hit my buddy up and I was
like, you know, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I left high school,
I went up to Chico and all my roommates
[SPEAKER_00]: there smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you might as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the second day I was in Chico,
one of the like this local like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: homeless guy, whatever they hung around
the apartment complex, brought us a hash
[SPEAKER_00]: ball that was like this almost the size of
a tennis ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he pulled out of like a 20 gram
nug, like outdoor nug, like a banana nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would not fly these days,
but some huge banana nug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big deal back then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big colas was a thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty quick after getting to
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started, you know, consuming,
but did Chico for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money kind of ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came home for a year still doing the
college thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real J.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just I was working at a zoomies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fun, you know, and that's this
cannabis culture right there, like
[SPEAKER_00]: zoomers, zoomies, skateboarding,
cannabis, like it's all, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been snowboarding for like 25
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like snowboarding, you know,
big roots there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I was associated with was
cannabis esque, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, after that second year or that
that year coming home, my really good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend at the time was dating a girl in
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, hey, dude, I'm moving to
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up Solano County ish,
you know, kind of Bayer like I just
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the Bay Area just right outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Bay Area, just to be clear,
but a lot of Bay influence almost almost
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay stops at Bart, as we used to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no Barton Fairfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's windy out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cordelia is the worst man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he was like, dude, I'm moving to
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I'm not staying
here, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm coming with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the end of it, we had four
guys moving down with us, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like by the time moving day came like
there was another you know, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all worked jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all went to college, tried to do our
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, it was so expensive down there
that we really were not making it like we
[SPEAKER_00]: were working full time jobs, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just weren't making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably about three months in,
we had it was a two bedroom apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two guys in each bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking mattresses basically touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like you we were good homies
by the end of that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two guys in each bedroom,
one guy on the couch, and then we had
[SPEAKER_00]: another guy move down and sleep on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy moved down and he kind of saw
the situation and he had always kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: side hustled in high school a little bit
or after high school, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, hey, you know,
there's a there's like a big price
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the Bay Area packs and
down here in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, no, we don't we don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so pretty quickly he had a good
plug and we were up in San Francisco
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got introduced to vending.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got introduced to vending and we
started hitting the clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, it was like 2011,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was seven, 800 clubs between San
Diego and L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was I mean, I remember the wild
west, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold a little bit here and there while
we were on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually living on the San Diego
State campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we weren't going to San Diego State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably why we were broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, somebody turned us on to
vending and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had we had good purple from
the Bay and good O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Bay GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any cookies yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, a cookies was so elusive
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me forever to get my hands on one,
the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, just packs of it like good,
legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packs of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you know, we developed a
good reputation because we would show up
[SPEAKER_00]: on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the club, the buyers would be
like, hey, beer at 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: on Tuesday with all you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would show up at 10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was no pot grower time for us
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that that came.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we were you know,
it was crazy to us that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were making maybe fifteen hundred
bucks, you know, each month working our
[SPEAKER_00]: full time jobs and we can move a few packs
and and pretty much scrape that up in a in
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of days, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to us, it was just like, oh,
my gosh, like we can live and we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: not that we had the business mindset like
we can scale this, but like we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: more, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a weird chain of events,
we actually got introduced to the guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: owned Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a trademark strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still is a straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do remember the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And held a ton of medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still does that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still take my headache away in five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know where I'd find it these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put you in touch with the right guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still in the Mendo coast, in the heart of
Fort Bragg, Minasino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, put us in touch with with,
you know, the head guy who basically
[SPEAKER_00]: funeral hunted Ingrid and kind of turned
it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He trademarked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He turned into a whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we got Ingrid on the menu,
all the clubs wanted us like we had
[SPEAKER_00]: Holistic Cafe, we had Green Door,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had these really big clients within
like two or three months of starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: vend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had legitimate clients that were
like, hey, if you don't show up with what
[SPEAKER_00]: you say, like we're going to be we're
going to be mad and we're not going to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: from you again, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started there was like four of us
and there was two of us would run,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, run up and grab units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of us would hustle the clubs and
like money and distribute, do whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to, you know, under the guise of
two fifteen, all two fifteen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we had Ingrid on the menu,
we really exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ingrid, once we had that,
that gave us all the bubba that was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the coast, all the U2 that was
coming out of the coast, all the cherry AK
[SPEAKER_00]: that was coming out of the coast,
man, just stuff lip smacking like you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't say cherry AK without just
salivating a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it really legitimized us and
we didn't know what we were doing at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking back on it, that was a really
big inflection point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did that for a while with them
and then a couple of months and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: started offering to like teach us how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're talking going to
learn on the Mendocino coast like it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like indoor or indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we learned indoor first and homes that
were blown up from the kitchen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bathroom, bro, like every square foot,
you know, in their clones in the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally moms in the in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything else was flour and
parabolic hoods and rolling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything with tomato cages and on
rolling, rolling trays or little plant
[SPEAKER_00]: trays, saucers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we we learned up there for a couple
of months, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just just like everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think early cannabis partnerships
were rough and not with the anger guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: just just the other people we were growing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so pretty quickly we were like,
OK, we need to branch off on our own and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of got the growing basics down
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were actually growing veganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned veganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veganic first, which was wild like Kyle
Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, like I learned from a direct
friend of Cushman in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what it meant at the time,
but looking back on it, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we actually ended up building an
indoor in El Dorado County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a killer house just.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 2011 and the 2010,
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And houses were cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is after the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the housing market and we're in,
you know, the boonies of El Dorado County.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, please just rent the house
from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, like, take it, you know,
in 30 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we actually we walked into
this place and there was it was a four
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand square foot house all together
with like if you totaled up the garage and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you open this little side door and
there was a basement built into a side of
[SPEAKER_00]: a hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was twelve hundred square feet,
almost twelve hundred square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with probably a thousand
square foot of cultivation space,
[SPEAKER_00]: two rooms, twenty something lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four guys in a house killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just live in the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally live in the 30 minutes from
Sarah Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we went, you know,
all winter we snowboard anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a little ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that was like our first our first
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up actually we took that down
in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ran for eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, man, we, you know, everything
was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think I think it was the end of
2011 or mid 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds came in to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and San Diego and started shutting the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost in like a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were, oh, you want a pound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a couple pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll pay us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need more of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they need us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we took a really big loss
because I knew James at whatever college
[SPEAKER_00]: collective on the corner of wherever,
you know, and that place disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did James.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and maybe he got seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we never heard from these people
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he owed you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they had consignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the it was a good lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the big first L.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consignment kills people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what's going on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the whole term game that's
going on now in 2024 is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've gone through it with seeds,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lesson after lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've learned my lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hope you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's people that still owe me
hundreds of thousands of seeds or money
[SPEAKER_01]: for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have another friend who just
sent me after two years, finally sent me
[SPEAKER_01]: my seeds back after hassling him for two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not getting paid, but at least I got my
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got your seeds back.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you popped them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing germ tests right now,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you feel a little light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, it was it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was like our turning point from
really understanding that we really wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in the grower, the grower position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, growing was something that
like young Tim, like 20 year old,
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 year old Tim, like really needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I needed something to put like just
to throw myself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is something so regimen that you
have to water them when they need water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to to harvest when you have
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of discipline required to
grow good flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at the end of the day, there's a lot
of discipline involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of these guys that you see
out there, they might be lazy in other
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they got fire, it's because they
had a lot of discipline and they did
[SPEAKER_01]: things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the plant doesn't grow itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it really doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but if you want good stuff,
especially now, yeah, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was it was good because I needed to
I needed something to kind of pour myself
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the difference between,
you know, taking the risk to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and like working at working retail was,
you know, you could kill it and an eight
[SPEAKER_00]: hour shift at retail, maybe get an hour of
overtime in and feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could spend that same amount of
time in your grow room and your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are exponentially better,
especially back then when you're hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and you're really paying
attention to each plant and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's way less of a production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hate relationship with the hand
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I still you know, I still start them
off with the hand water, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still hand water my outdoor plants in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I still enjoy waking up in the
morning, you know, and hitting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking the plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it gets me right in the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More therapy than a yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to take you off to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do anything in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a two year old right now and he's
curious about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I end up eating the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pulling branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, he pulls all my wildflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have pollinator garden in my
front yard and they're starting to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple couple poppies are going right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just like, Dad, flower and just
ripping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but anyway, yeah, it's you know,
it was really, really cool that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we had the opportunity to learn
from who we learned from and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: find our own path in it, because after
that we really became growers like we
[SPEAKER_00]: always had outlets because that's you
know, you had to have a secure outlet back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you couldn't just roll up to
the grow and fill up your your Yukon with
[SPEAKER_00]: packs like you had to know somebody who
knew somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was much more of a growers market back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, it was, you know, and yeah,
it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't as many, you know,
there was people that broker.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are buyers and people kind of did
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now some of them, they want to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a single vertically integrated
human.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, back in the traditional
market, we you did have to wear a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times you were doing your own
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing your own extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing your own construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were doing, you know, you had stuff
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't have an AC guy come over
because exactly, you know, I wasn't that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't in the cards typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not unless you had a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we had a guy, but not everybody had
a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody had a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a I had a guy which was,
oh, my gosh, the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a great electrician who knew just
about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, it it was great,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I really like developed such a love for
the plant and really, I think the the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle it afforded was so cool,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we just chase snow all winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we I think the year after we
built that indoor, we got outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities in Willets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great growing climate in Willets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love Willets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cool enough at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real, real hot during the day,
but just cool enough during the night to
[SPEAKER_00]: really pull some terpenes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just they've been growing fire out of
there for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we we rolled the dice big,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were we got a property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a we called it the Plywood Palace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a three story plywood building that
had indoor capabilities, which it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we outfitted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when the the triple XL Raptor
hoods were big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were we were putting those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ballasts that were like 80 pounds,
like those things would rip your freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: arm out of your socket if you grabbed it
the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like those I think they were the
Miami ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know why they were mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But someone needs to have a light museum
for all the old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would totally go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: See some collective effort from all of the
companies because everybody's had their
[SPEAKER_01]: contributions and I feel like everybody
has their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love the adjuster wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the wings were killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was like the air cooled
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the first it was like the four inch
and then it was like the upgrade was the
[SPEAKER_01]: six inch air cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had cool tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things back in the day that you do not see
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good because, gosh, man, the fungus
gnats that would get in those freaking the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats that would crawl up there and
die by the thousand, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting in there and cleaning in between
runs, because you're like, if I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: clean that that that freaking glass,
that's probably chalk with lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get no yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it was that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The museum, the that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old ballast, noisy ballast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people could experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full immersion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the experience where plants are
being grown with all the old equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cool would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You whip out your cell phone and it's the
freaking zebra stripes again because the
[SPEAKER_00]: magnets are jacking your camera up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were good times, though,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we don't have any pictures of
this shit, because you couldn't take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture in those rooms with the ballast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our adjustable spectrum,
we have the science adjustable spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: and those dragon alphas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you get the zebra vertical.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vertical verticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to I'll have to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, you know, we so we went ham
and will it's and we put out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did our thing and I had to go up this
crazy switch back, you know, to get up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the plywood palace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were I mean, we were we were
roughing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was about six of us just
bootstrapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doing whatever we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we didn't have irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not irrigate 99, you know,
300 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so we were we were carrying five
gallon buckets back and forth every day
[SPEAKER_00]: watering those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all had we all had traps up
to our ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were just yoked from,
you know, chest up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we did what we had to do
and we had the indoor and Aldo going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we kept it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turned on the indoor for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a 70 kilowatt whisper what
generator didn't know what we were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you had to have a generator
mechanic and do refills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just a bunch of kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent I don't even know how many
tens of thousands of dollars to build out
[SPEAKER_00]: an indoor inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it became very unfeasible for us
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we turned our focus on outdoor to kind
of recuperate all of what we had thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And August bed showed up and cut us down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went in and their favorite thing
to do is go into your equipment and cut
[SPEAKER_00]: all the cords, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut all the cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they did the whole nine field
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's crazy as we really do
believe to this day, they let us leave and
[SPEAKER_00]: then went and cut everything down because
back then they got paid by how many plants
[SPEAKER_00]: they cut down and not by how many arrests
they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't care about arresting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wanted to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the cool part about the Cali
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional market is like, unless you
were messing around with BHO, like they
[SPEAKER_00]: probably weren't arresting you,
you know, unless you were transporting
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of pounds like they probably
weren't arresting you, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just especially up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing is, the community
revolved around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a kid in school,
other parents were involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It touched everybody, especially,
you know, the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's livelihood revolved around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you owned a shop, you know,
people that were buying stuff from your
[SPEAKER_01]: shop were involved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it normalized it way, way earlier than
it did all around the rest of the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States because it's fairly normalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like overall, you know,
over 50% of the people like cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, I mean, over 50% of the
people don't like, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes are 50 50 with people,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're doing really good and I
think we made a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we definitely have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw a statistic the other day
that was like based on like population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you just look at population and
urban centers, like more than 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States population wise has access
to legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think it's like almost 40
states now are, you know, med or rec,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's coming like, you know,
but but yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so regular up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we still nobody could be
like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you could walk down the street
with a plant in your hand and like people
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like, cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't do that back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, it was it was just
regular day, you know, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got when we got hit, it was it was
pretty gnarly and it freaked us out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought law enforcement had their stuff
together a little more than law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement probably did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we thought they were kind of
on to us, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of the a couple of the guys
went and like kind of hit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a cool campsite to this day that's
still pretty remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: El Dorado County, you know, and a real,
real sneaky spot where you can get back
[SPEAKER_00]: into town in about 25 minutes,
get your supplies and get back up the
[SPEAKER_00]: hill, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real, real good spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost simultaneously, our spot that
we were kind of we were still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were still working the San
Diego, L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: market almost simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got hit really put us on high alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a complete coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the day it happened,
we were like, oh, my God, we're tapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, you know, you just your
mind starts going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a couple of us stayed up there,
hit our clone guy on the coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: replanted three days later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, you know,
it was you know, it was early August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of babied them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hardened them off to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made sure everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we replanted everything
that this guy didn't need for a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we we we drove, I don't know how
many trips back and forth from the coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to Willett's on the sketchy S 20
and put everything on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we pretty much broke even for the
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, monetary wise, which was just
insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than a lot of lessons,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of lessons that it didn't
cost too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of sweat equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're 22, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sweat equity was all we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody went to jail and broke even.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those are life lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a freaking a write up, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't even get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we didn't get anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt pretty lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of closed the chapter on the
group that we had kind of assembled all
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys that were with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there were six or seven of us by that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had our hopes on really hitting it
big and getting more properties for people
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had all these grand, you know,
I was going to buy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This truck and, you know, like fit in with
the brodozers going around Mendo,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really was kind of the it was the
end of that era for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's really great to look back on
those few years because it was so raw and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really a family.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was your family as who we who
we did everything with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you lose together and you
win together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You break bread together like it's a it's
a bond that never can be really broken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the best kind of
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a couple of guys were like,
yeah, cannabis isn't for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it because I was hoping to,
you know, fund my whatever, whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: go do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and some of us were like,
oh, no, I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of broke up, found our own ways
and ended up back in El Dorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up getting some outdoor
capabilities in El Dorado the next summer
[SPEAKER_00]: with like two thousand dollars to my name,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I had an indoor run, that was like
if I don't hit this, I have no money to
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to get into this spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddies will tell you to this day,
like they didn't see me for like six to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight months because I couldn't leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I could go to the grocery store and
back to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's what it took to be
able to have the money to run outdoor the
[SPEAKER_00]: next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once, you know, successful
outdoor season, then you were good and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could, you know, parlay it into the next
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, did that for a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chase snow all winter and grew all
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a killer life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody showed me how to pull tarps in
like 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started depping and game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, you know, getting two,
three runs a year of SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have to leave the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: People came to me, you know, running.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were running four hundred gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety nine of them on a hillside,
a bunch of little debt houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was it was a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 20 acres is a dream,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the outdoor was going for more than
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually ended up what really not
only getting burnt out on legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: came, you know, a couple of years after,
like I had a few good years legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things got weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization was scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going up and down since like
2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty seventeen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody came in and offered me like
twelve hundred bucks for my freaking SFV
[SPEAKER_00]: or my sherb or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I'm not doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually started to kind of get
my college credits back in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got my credits back in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went to Lake Tahoe Junior
College there in Southlake and got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything back in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 2018, I was ready to kind of leave
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really burnt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were legal, but still getting
raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was just such a confusing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have the attorney and yeah,
I could have figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just heard about the millions
being poured in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I don't have that
Canada coming into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard just all the crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually just like I thought I had
retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I went back to school,
was lucky enough to get into UC Davis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the College of Ag there and started
playing around with some pretty cool
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually where I was introduced
to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hated LEDs back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always blurple, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys, every every single guy that
tried to sell me on the purple LEDs,
[SPEAKER_01]: they grew like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, there's no way they were also
like 30 watts like the ones you dropped
[SPEAKER_00]: into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like no intensity to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so auto flowers back in the day and
the purple LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I said I wrote those off for
the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had the blocks of cocos and we
had to break them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hated that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I'm never using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I use cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pro-mix till I die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like all the substrates for different
reasons for rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock wool is great for certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm a huge cocoa fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love soil, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the right application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I went back to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: The craziest thing was I didn't have Wi-Fi
all those years in the hills growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stepped into like middle of Davis and
I got these kids that are brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you transfer into Davis,
you don't have to be as brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be straight up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come from high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're top of your class.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not top of my class in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I only transferred in because
they were like, hey, there's a guarantee
[SPEAKER_00]: from South Lake J.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: to UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, sign up for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're almost guaranteed as long as
you have a good GPA and you meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's called a tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I transferred in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I always try to make a point to
say it when I when I have a public
[SPEAKER_00]: platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't pay to go back to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're over the age of 24, 25,
and I think it's still going on for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the UC system, you're over the age 24,
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make less than a certain amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was like 80,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you make less than 80,000 dollars
on paper, they'll pay for your education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually didn't come out of
pocket a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had to live in a very expensive
city, which is Davis is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all my food and stuff like that and
all my books and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't pay for my education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis is a great school.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn about cannabis,
not just smoking, but but actually
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, it's a great ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and what was really cool is I think my
second quarter there, there was a zero net
[SPEAKER_00]: energy like elective and it was a master's
elective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in there with a bunch of master's
kids and I was getting my undergrad,
[SPEAKER_00]: my bachelor's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's these things called growth
chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what growth chambers are?
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe once I.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just imagine the size of a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a grow room that fits inside of a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got temp control, humidity control,
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like once I explained so and
they're actually pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like 40 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, Davis, obviously being the
ag research school, they are they have
[SPEAKER_00]: like 200 of these below, like one of the
science buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of these things is rented by
a professor who's doing some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they trial there, then they can
take it to the outdoor plots, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in wherever there's, you know,
Davis has acres and acres and acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the school is looking at still is
trying to figure out how to get to zero
[SPEAKER_00]: net energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's on the carbon neutral path
right now and was in 2022 or 2020 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all using HID lights in
these little boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little refrigerators,
they're just blasting metal highlight or
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the dual ended with different
with, you know, the opposite bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, the project I was on was
retrofitting those with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I got put in that class, in that
program, because I had all this knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: of, like, HID lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these kids with me who were
masters kids, really brilliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: just brilliant kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like running the show because I'm
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like it was just so so funny how it
worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we actually had to,
you know, figure it out over like a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: months, figure out the payback,
you know, how long it's going to take for
[SPEAKER_00]: the payback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of like, you know, energy savings and the
cost of the lights and which ones the
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones the professors need and to make
sure their research is uninterrupted and
[SPEAKER_00]: yada yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we actually had a big presentation
for a lot of like higher ups at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is me like six months into going
back to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, just winging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first introduction to LEDs and
and diodes and understanding efficacy and
[SPEAKER_00]: just like all the little things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and there was a couple big
players at the time, but it was still in
[SPEAKER_00]: his infant stages and, you know,
early 21.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the adoption adoption was on its way,
but it wasn't as flushed out as it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not even close, not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was still running blurples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people are going to go blind in HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, California, HPS are going to
be going away, according to our governor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I what's what's your thought on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way it doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just has to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just if I mean, do they're trying to
limit gas powered generators around here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like those are worth their
weight in gold right now in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand the indoor like it's
extremely energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really should be growing in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the perfect world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people don't agree sometimes
because they don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lack of education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lack of education because that is
the perfect world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe with supplemental lighting in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the key because you're getting the
natural light from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save you a little money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lower your cogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some under canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greenhouse under canopy is wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So honestly, my biggest interest with
under canopy when I listened to you
[SPEAKER_01]: lecture was the greenhouse application,
because I feel like that's where so much
[SPEAKER_01]: product gets wasted more than anywhere
else is the greenhouse that has the larpy
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now if you can correct that,
now you got a really amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Game changer for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get bigger yields, you make more money
and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's struggling right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything to increase that margin for
growers so they can keep operating and
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of their people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of take people or catch
people off guard when I say this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but greenhouse is actually a better
application for under canopy than indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor so sufficiently lit that like,
yeah, there's potential yield potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like just about everybody we
know first time users fave in 25 to 35
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll stand by that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's pretty much there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're talking greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at the mercy of the sun,
you're at the mercy of the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, you have some bad days,
you know, and and we talk winter runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people shut it down for winter
because their par readings are two fifty
[SPEAKER_00]: three hundred a canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't you're not it's just not worth
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had a lot of trials over
this past winter and.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple people were really close to 100
percent increase compared to winter runs
[SPEAKER_00]: prior and the quality was everything went
over a thousand went over for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything because it had the spectrum was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were we were siding with our more red
spectrum because the sun's going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the full spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's side on what the plant benefits
from most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the you know, the red side of
things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, not only is the yield increase
just absolutely ridiculous because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with such low D.L.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants are actually struggling,
but the proximity of the lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're we're delivering close close
canopy lighting to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even even the mix light facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're hoping to get to six
hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, part canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hoping if you can pitch seven
hundred, seven fifty and you're greeny,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you can do five to six
hundred at top and, you know, five hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle and, you know, or higher
than that in the middle with other kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can push it in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sky is the limit, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to talk about lowering
planting densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge like the amount of plants
that greenhouses deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you can lower your plant count 10
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and the workability around Favon's
to write at two seventy seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run 20 of these on a daisy chain,
you know, so you can run full benches on
[SPEAKER_00]: two seventy seven volt all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deliver so much light to these plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the greenhouse is really, really where
my heart is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how controlled it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still at the mercy of our HVACs
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And D Hums for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody unplug the, you know,
the pump, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But greenhouse is really the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cultivation space, it's
understanding your microclimate outside
[SPEAKER_00]: your greeny and inside your greeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, guys like, you know,
the dirt mansion guys up in Humboldt just
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Dave Polly prefer gardens like
killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolute beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wish him well in his new
40,000 square foot project out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yolo, he's absolutely killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's the guy's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's such a tough go in
greenhouses right now because there isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: that much of a difference in price between
outdoor and indoor is so cheap that people
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times buyers will just go get
indoor because they can get indoor for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost you know, for a couple of points
more, you know, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that yield has to be there in the
greenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really like that application of under
canopy lighting greenhouses is the
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute best in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're meant for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really looking forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of cool partnerships coming
up that and people who have trials right
[SPEAKER_00]: now that I don't really want to discuss
yet, but you'll be seeing it very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are, people are geeking on
these things and and greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're having a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just, let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a great application.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how you grow it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could be soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be, you know, you could be
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to, you're going to see a
much greater yield potential increase than
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor because yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get more resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's what I'm excited about
more than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, the seed stuff, all that
stuff, but like, I really see the across
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I think it is going to have
the most impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And should we all be cultivating
greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't be, but you know,
I'll enjoy a lot while it lasts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, yeah, it's, it's scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's why they have these a
hundred acre greenhouses coming online and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and if you go to like Holland and
look at like the Dutch greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to know like where this is all is
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's the greenhouse application
is it's what I'm most excited about too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just something about looking at a
plant inside a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just something so natural about
it and so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like indoor, they still have
that beautiful green, but outdoor in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, that Emerald green is just so
rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That color is what's in between the look
of the outdoor to the indoor, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get an indoor looking product that has the
crystals, the structure, the density,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think those things are
important to people that visual where
[SPEAKER_01]: like, not, not that there's anything wrong
with the outdoor cause I love amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, if you do outright killer,
that's the best killer, but typically for
[SPEAKER_01]: the buyers on the market that are,
you know, the consumers that are buying
[SPEAKER_01]: from stores, they're going to want
something that looks like an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next best thing I think is the
green house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with a lot of
partnerships coming up and we're excited
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get, get talking about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, there's so much cool stuff
on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just opening the door for not only
like growing in times when you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be in areas where it's very tough,
like, you know, winter runs and greenies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also genetics that don't really have
that much yield, like all these genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can't run in scale, you know,
Skittles being one of them is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't really do it in commercial
settings because it just doesn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my friends do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: SF Canada among other people with SF
Canada, killing it with the Skittles and
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes out amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually SF Canada right out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if people want to find out more about
you, where do they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fave and lighting Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to put a ton of resources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fave and lighting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you can order.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fill out a lighting layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting layouts are great because it's a
three minute questionnaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us everything we know we need to
know to spec out your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fill out one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send you back exactly what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you need this many lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need this cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send you out your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three step process.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got Fave and lighting Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fave and lighting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm Bobby bags on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I have, I've been,
I think I have a presence there for about
[SPEAKER_00]: three and a half years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am now on team Fave and I appreciate you
being on team Fave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to doing all these
trials together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to get you on a podcast once we
have some results, so we can go over the
[SPEAKER_01]: results with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'd be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should do it to where I don't know what
the results are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like I want to be side by
side, catch me on air, like with my
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction, because that's so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wake up all the time to text
messages from people that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, it was 35%, you know, 40% yield
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes my day because you know
that that just gave them some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: financial relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're Fino hunting with it,
we're doing all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a lot of, a lot of
interesting things going on in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best part about getting tools
in the right people's hands, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and trying something new that,
you know, is going to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's a no-brainer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a lot of things out
there where it's like, eh, we'll see how
[SPEAKER_01]: it does, but I feel like it's a
no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it work with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a killer platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats on your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were happy where they're selling
like hot cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to hear it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure how they were going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just never know how books are going to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how Favin would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how, I mean, I look at guys
like Rob Clark and Ed Rosenthal and I see
[SPEAKER_01]: them like their books sell and they're
good books.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other breeding book besides
Greg Green's, which is 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm sure someone else will write
another breeding book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm excited to have the breeding
book on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited to hear that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And congratulations again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know what it's like to
write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope in the next 10 to 15 years,
that becomes something that I started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just big ups to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, it's a lot of dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for coming on the podcast and
we'll do this again.
Later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
