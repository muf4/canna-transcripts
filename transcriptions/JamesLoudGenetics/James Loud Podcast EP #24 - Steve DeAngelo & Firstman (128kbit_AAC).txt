[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Rastafari were vaporizing
cannabis 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost nobody in the world of cannabis
knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we got special guests, Fersman from
Jamaica and Steve D'Angelo, activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done some amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We bumped into each other at Deddon
Company, came by and gave you a joint and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you posted it on Instagram and we
connected that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great joint too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that about many joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed that joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor to continue to see the
evolution of this great plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys want to tell me a little bit
about what you guys are doing in town?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys in town for the psychedelic
conference, I take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafari is not normally a part of,
or I don't even know if we're ever a part
[SPEAKER_03]: of psychedelics, but we are definitely a
part of the earth movement of earth
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being ganja is one of our focus ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that got to us first in our
enslaved space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being in California, that's a good
thing, but there was the Oakland
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic conference and it's really a
conference that promotes the black African
[SPEAKER_03]: way of thinking within the Americas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was important for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a space that is interfacing with
our African concerns as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all Rastafari is really about in
terms of how can we have a return to a
[SPEAKER_03]: better way of life amongst the human
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to see this African movement in this
kind of a space was what is now called
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to come and to learn,
to touch base with my family and to see
[SPEAKER_03]: what we all are doing on different sides
for our restoration, for our decolonizing
[SPEAKER_03]: mission and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so I came up just to view this
conference to check my brethren.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve and I are doing this project in
Jamaica also where it was hard to find
[SPEAKER_03]: someone who really would assist us to
focus on our African retention.
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed some assistance after COVID and
we find a way out to assist each other by
[SPEAKER_03]: implementing a project down there on
Rastafari Indigenous Village.
[SPEAKER_03]: This space has existed 15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, after COVID, COVID was
frightening.
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID, we didn't know what that was and we
still don't know what the hell it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, our standard way of functioning
was to bring in visitors and educate them
[SPEAKER_03]: in an experiential way about our
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see 50, 80 people in our space.
[SPEAKER_03]: After COVID, we decided that there was no
way we were going to do that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we looked into it,
we decided that the best way, we could
[SPEAKER_03]: have smaller groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had some cabins and they required
upgrading and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I spoke to the great man here and we
worked out what we considered to be
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative economics, which is what,
because I think where Steve and myself
[SPEAKER_03]: connect is that there is the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still govern the people who are looking
to make the change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what Ganja was about.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we change?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we be different from these
systems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafari call them shit sims.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what our journey is for us now
to start looking at alternative ways,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to share resources, how to function,
how to speak to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we evolve our own community without
the lawyers or without the this or without
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else that seems to guide our
relationship?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we move outside of the box?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what has connected Steve and
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We move out of the box with this
particular project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it has brought us here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a pilot project.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a kind of experiment,
but with some clarity that what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do is to make a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where is it located?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're in Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just outside of Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The property is called Rastafari
Indigenous Village.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's popular in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you Google it www.rastavillage.com,
you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's kind of the last piece of
green.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an ecosystem where people live
there and insects and animals and rivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everything is there because this
city is expanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, human beings are actually
creating our own hell on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just removing trees and putting
buildings and the place is just getting
[SPEAKER_03]: hot, hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're fulfilling our own Bible
mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, religion is still leading us
straight over the precipice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that space is a preservation space,
you know, for a culture that has been so
[SPEAKER_03]: so attacked and marginalized only because
we wanted to mitigate the lies that were
[SPEAKER_03]: told about us about the continent of
Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a preservation space where all
the traditions of Rastafari that are being
[SPEAKER_03]: lost, you know, because of systemic
discrimination over the years,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has really made our children not always
connecting to our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are preserving the tradition of our
food, tradition of our herbal knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: with plants, the tradition of how we make
drums, you know, everything that requires
[SPEAKER_03]: for our spirituality and our way of life
to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that that's what that space is
sort of looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many things are going away because of
convenience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even if you look at some,
you know, me having a background as a
[SPEAKER_02]: chef, you know, even vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's the disconnect between
the farmer and we lost that many years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think with farmers market,
some of the stuff is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the amazing things about
Rastafari indigenous villages that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a place that preserves and lives by
the lessons the sacred plants teach us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encountered the village and met first
month in twenty nineteen when I was on a
[SPEAKER_01]: global tour going around the world,
trying to see whether the changes we had
[SPEAKER_01]: made around the world were worth the
sacrifices that we made in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get those changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up in Jamaica and came to the
village and the village is this amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: four acre oasis just 20 minutes away from
the Montego Bay Airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the village was founded in 2007,
Montego Bay has kind of grown up around
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the village property is this beautiful
natural spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a medicinal herb garden where
there is more than 100 medicinal herbs
[SPEAKER_01]: that are being grown in Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the experience that visitors
can have is to go into that garden with
[SPEAKER_01]: Queen I or near area or one of our other
healers who understand those plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: can help folks select the plants that that
are most beneficial for whatever issues
[SPEAKER_01]: they may be facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's got some kind of issue,
a little bit of tune up that they need for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Queen I has a ball in the yard
where folks can learn how to with very
[SPEAKER_01]: simple techniques turn those herbs that
they can go home and grow in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: garden into tinctures, into balms,
into shampoos, into lotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a regenerative food and
cannabis garden where everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: being grown is being grown in
relationships with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insects to plants, plants, plants,
plants, soil, all in a beneficial cycle of
[SPEAKER_01]: of relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: A drum studio where King Toto preserves
drum making techniques that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: handed down generation by generation all
the way from Africa, a beautiful river
[SPEAKER_01]: that runs through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that that's just an
amazing experience is you can wake up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning, you can walk down to the
river.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the way to the river, you pass by
this cathedral like trees, 100 feet tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 feet tall bamboo trees, but also mango
trees, aki trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado trees, breadfruit trees,
June plum trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in what you collect from those
trees and your walk down to the river and
[SPEAKER_01]: back is enough to feed everybody in the
village.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then folks can sit down and learn
traditional Rastafari, Ital ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking that food on open fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all about reconnection to this natural
way of life that the sacred plants lead us
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just what we have to do,
what we have always been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, we're living in a different
world, where the world can... We're so far
[SPEAKER_03]: before time, this movement Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we started to speak about one love,
it was so mis-conceptualized to think that
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a one love of human beings because
it came out of our great poet Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was really one love of the planet,
what we're doing to the planet and how our
[SPEAKER_03]: behaviors and attitudes are affecting the
resources of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the connections between every living
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that was there, but now the
world is kind of waking up to climate
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are seeing that we have been messing up
a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has opened up a different kind of
conversation may not be with governments,
[SPEAKER_03]: but with ordinary people.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are getting much sicker by the fact
that they are not eating real things no
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of traditions are being lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are recognizing that the
impositions of system today, some of them
[SPEAKER_03]: have been living in the time when it was
not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people now want to revisit what their
yesterday was now that they have
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Movements and it has created this timing
for a different, a more sobering
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation instead of a conversation of
ridicule that would normally come.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time when Rastafari,
I remember not eating meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided that we were italics
because we didn't know anything about
[SPEAKER_03]: vegan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your parents out of concern,
they just thought you're going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally just think that all that is
going to happen to you is that you will be
[SPEAKER_03]: malnute and you will die pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the entire world is vegan,
vegan, vegan everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So- Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the big problem that
oftentimes gets overlooked is processed
[SPEAKER_02]: foods and getting away from processed
foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegan, people that eat, whatever,
you eat meat, whatever type of diet you're
[SPEAKER_02]: on, I think you're better off eating whole
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for many, many thousands of years,
we ate whole ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only recently that we had these
processed foods with all these
[SPEAKER_02]: preservatives and these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, there's definitely something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're at a time where we can
identify and we can all agree that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: The world is so educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now all information is at the tip of your
finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's almost sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole grains are part of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole anything is part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eating food as close to its natural form
is part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the reasons that I dedicated
myself to a plant-based diet is because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone all around the world advocating
for a hemp-based economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that one day somebody was going
to ask me from the crowd, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve, if you are advocating for a
hemp-based economy, can you tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly how many acres of land it's going
to take to convert our current economy to
[SPEAKER_01]: a hemp-based economy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sat down and started thinking about
that and doing the calculations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I learned was very sobering,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is just barely enough agricultural
land on this planet to convert ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: to a plant-based, hemp-based economy and
to head off the climate catastrophe,
[SPEAKER_01]: just barely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not possible to do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because 80%, 80% of the agricultural land
on this planet is being used for
[SPEAKER_01]: animal-based agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you believe in a hemp-based,
plant-based economy, if you really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get rid of fossil fuels, then adopting the
pantheist diet is a necessary corollary to
[SPEAKER_01]: having a hemp-based economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what pushed me over the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Italian, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I love my Parmesan cheese?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're living in a time now where it's
very difficult for human beings to take
[SPEAKER_01]: individual actions that have a real impact
on preserving the planet, where we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go to the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to go to an investment
committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to make an investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is make a decision that
we're going to eat a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if all of us did that, if all of us
who have relationships with plants decided
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that, we would remove a massive
amount of atmospheric carbon from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the potential to do these
really amazing things now that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: united by the consciousness that these
plants spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as legalization in Jamaica,
you guys have had legalization for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has that changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has that changed the landscape?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I tell you, you know, we got the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw different type of subconscious or
implicit bias type of colonization coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from the investors of overseas,
you know, mainly darting in from Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You call the name, yes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly coming in from Canada and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I say, I'm not going to say to you that
the move was let's go and colonize.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just how it feels to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have no thoughts that there
were bad intentions at the beginning or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just works out to be that when I'm
speaking about this community,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not expecting to see the suits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really expecting to see the roots,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrew gave me that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much suits.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the plant does not reason like
that, doesn't have the conversations in
[SPEAKER_03]: this type of way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have spent a lot of time blaming
governments, but then not in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this industry, it's the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we are misrepresenting the
behaviors and attitude of this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can't put that on government.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have to put that on when we
got that opportunity to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they got the opportunity to come
into Jamaica, you know, everybody started
[SPEAKER_03]: to behave as if they were ganja smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They forgot about the legacy community.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not patient enough to allow what
Jamaica had contributed to the world to be
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is properly packaged and
structures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not not not just in a flurry of
advertisement, but in real hardcore steps,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to just ensure that Jamaica and
its tradition was represented in our
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafari and what what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, we were releasing so
much valves in the 70s and and the 60s,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when that's all all the ganja
was coming from Jamaica and giving a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of New Yorkers my mate, the entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: an opportunity to breathe from all the
systemic pressures that were coming down
[SPEAKER_03]: on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know this, you know, and this is
why every time I speak about these things,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying that we as human beings should
not hide behind government when we get the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we recognizing legacy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we looking at the restoration and the
reparation within our own community?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and and and and that has been to
me the issue in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you move off too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no legacy conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who suffered for it was not
recognized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just went up to nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just in the mind that it was going
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever reflected in
sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never reflected in nothing that it was
profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just this idea that Jamaica has a branding
and the tourists is going to come and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone was sold the dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it right, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone was sold a dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so that's how that's how the
criminalization work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at the moment, I think all
dispensers are quite possibly suffering
[SPEAKER_03]: because they were trying to build an
industry instead of a relationship with
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have to redefine the way how
this plant that forces us to think,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, let's say everybody is going to
collapse.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everybody is going to collapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Rastafari also got some kind of
preferential treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not it's not connected with the
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rastafari philosophy is one legalize the
plan for every human being.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's like mangoes,
pop choy and it needs to be fully
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're having this discussion about
rescheduling and it needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: descheduled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just common sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so they gave us this kind of a
preferential treatment, which is now
[SPEAKER_03]: allowing us to sit with governments and
lobby on where our rights are and so on
[SPEAKER_03]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, as I say, sometimes you
find you start looking at the government
[SPEAKER_03]: and wondering if they were not there,
how would we as a community deal with each
[SPEAKER_03]: other?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we able to self-regulate?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a big question to the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we self-regulate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we properly appropriate ourselves to
each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we recognize legacy?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was passed in Jamaica in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was medical, quote unquote,
medical cannabis legislation that was
[SPEAKER_01]: passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of that legislation,
Rastafari communities were supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: given certain sacramental rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really another example of
cannabis being regulated by people who do
[SPEAKER_01]: not understand the plant and do not
respect the plant and thereby
[SPEAKER_01]: misregulating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you one glaring example.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go into any of the dispensaries
in Jamaica, which are by law medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis dispensaries, first of all,
the only people who can afford to go in
[SPEAKER_01]: them are tourists because the price of the
cannabis is the same as the price of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in most legal American states and
legal tax the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite high, far higher than any
Jamaicans or most Jamaicans would be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second is that the only form of
cannabis that you can get at the quote
[SPEAKER_01]: unquote medical cannabis dispensaries is
inhaled cannabis, hash or buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: something you have to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: No tinctures, no capsules, no cakes,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is because there's
a history in Jamaica of tourists coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: the island, eating space cakes in a tea
shop, eating too many of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: ending up in the emergency room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the government having to deal
with the fallout from those kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: incidents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a completely ridiculous move,
the most effective format, edible or
[SPEAKER_01]: change your format for medical cannabis
patients was made illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most dangerous format,
inhaled cannabis was made the only one
[SPEAKER_01]: that was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one sector that was given birth
to by the 2015 legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sector is not doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a second sector, which was an
export sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea behind this sector was to
take advantage of the sunshine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the low labor costs of Jamaica and set up
basically a neo-colonial extractive model
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plants would be grown in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you would do a basic extraction in
Jamaica but then that basic extract would
[SPEAKER_01]: be sent to Europe mostly for further
refinement, further processing,
[SPEAKER_01]: further value added and then be sold into
the pharmaceutical supply chain as an API,
[SPEAKER_01]: an approved pharmaceutical input.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sector seems to be doing a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the companies there that had well
thought out business plans and had some
[SPEAKER_01]: financing seem to be doing some sales and
maybe not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not thriving, but at least surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other companies in that sector are in
crisis because the international market
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were relying on has developed
much, much more slowly than was originally
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the third part of the
market, which is the most interesting part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the market because it's the only part
of the market that's really connected to
[SPEAKER_01]: this incredibly rich ganja culture that
Jamaica gave birth to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's such an amazing gift to the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the culture that grew out of
Rastafari as expressed by reggae and now
[SPEAKER_01]: adopted in one form or another by hundreds
of millions of reggae fans all around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that version of cannabis in Jamaica is
now found in Rastafari community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's discussion that's going on
about formally authorizing communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that discussion is fully
potentiated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then hopefully where we end up,
where we'd like to see it end up is a
[SPEAKER_01]: situation where visitors to the island can
go and have access to the real genuine
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaican ganja experience where you can
learn about the Rastafari history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastafari were vaporizing cannabis 50
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost nobody in the world of cannabis
knows that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just all of the stories,
all of the songs that go along with all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that culture, the way that cannabis has
influenced the thinking and the way of
[SPEAKER_01]: life of Rastafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just an incredibly rich
experience for anybody who really loves
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one that so far has been pretty
difficult to seek out and find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully with this conversation going
on, Rastafari communities will be fully
[SPEAKER_01]: empowered to represent not just the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not just the plant that's
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lessons that the plant teaches us
and what we do with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the genetics that have come out of
Jamaica, Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was in Jamaica, I got,
I basically gave $20 to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different people and never got anything
good when I was staying at a resort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally I brought some flour from the
States from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some really good OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave it to the guy and I told him to
take it to whoever he gets stuff from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he comes back the next day with big
joints from Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what to expect because I had
gotten some really bad, but this,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was so strong that I think it was 10 in
the morning and I woke up at five with my
[SPEAKER_02]: wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: We woke up at five in the bed going,
what the heck was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we look over and the joints still
about that big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's some legendary lambs bred,
lambs breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to remember that as
Rastafari, we don't see Jamaica as our
[SPEAKER_03]: home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaica is not necessarily, it's a
colonized state that we have now the sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of by dwelling there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we have to recreate
ourselves from to go home to Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our ultimate mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of that, being in spaces
like those, you have to be strong and
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful and everything you do has to be
potent because you want to do it natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: Natural is our potency is not necessarily
about how much percent is here or how much
[SPEAKER_03]: is how natural you really have engaged
with your process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things in doing
that, those messages come from the
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different, it's cultural science
and what prohibition did, it damaged that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It damaged that spiritual relationship of
the cultural science.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to start storing your herb in
some weird places.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to start putting fertilizer on
them because you need them to grow fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then you sort of bring in
all the hybrids because you want six weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want 12 weeks instead of six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the entire culture started
to go through a process of adaptation and
[SPEAKER_03]: all kind of mix up, you know, kind of
attitudes, you know, amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is good that this time is here for
us to revisit, you know, the way how we
[SPEAKER_03]: would want it and want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the conversation is not just so
much about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The conversation is really about the
lessons that the plant has taught us and
[SPEAKER_03]: how do we incorporate those lessons,
not in terms of just material gain,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in terms of preservation and
protection of ourselves as the human
[SPEAKER_03]: family?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I think that's the main
conversation we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want lamb's bread and we want to play
the role that we saw to play, but we also
[SPEAKER_03]: want to evolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to see every aspect of this
because it's only restriction that stopped
[SPEAKER_03]: us from from exploring all our cultural
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really interesting with all
these international countries that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going legal and how we can all work
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like and then, as Steve was
saying earlier, with these countries like
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, for example, that they've gone so
slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like there is potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think working with Jamaica
is like lamb's bread or Orange Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Orange Hill is a region more than
a, you know, I think that would be more
[SPEAKER_02]: like a viticultural area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but being able to work with those and
being able to import into the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, I think there's huge benefit for
us to have access to Jamaican flour and
[SPEAKER_02]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think on a world scale,
I think it'd be amazing to honor each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the conversation that I'm really
sort of trying to get at is how do we
[SPEAKER_03]: honor each other?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's so much except when,
you know, I can't remember where I went to
[SPEAKER_03]: and saw a man changing out all the things
that he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's now getting in new equipment and now
he's getting rid of old ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that technology has not even reached
Jamaica yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has nothing really to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, he just has to get rid of
them because now there's a new technology,
[SPEAKER_03]: either it be in lights and in trays and
methods and whatever be the case that that
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't even reached Jamaica yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then you're having Jamaicans
coming over here planting and growing and
[SPEAKER_03]: California here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they come and they see the systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: They try to come back and implement some
of what they think they saw and how that
[SPEAKER_03]: could work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is nothing unique to that local
space more than what was there from Orange
[SPEAKER_03]: Hill, where those people have crafted
their own relationship with the plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: has delivered from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and when you speak to them about
this relationship, it does most of it like
[SPEAKER_03]: most cannabis people is is really the time
they spend with the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everybody call it their girls or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this very intimate, intimate
relationship with the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this goes for probably all
kind of people who touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they all have that type of a
vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we all have these unique,
intimate relationships and they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Steve has a different
relationship with the plant than I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as an advocate, as somebody who
got us to this point, to a degree,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, I think you paved the
way for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were a boundary pusher.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when there was other people that
were scared to come out and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: F you, I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care if you guys want to stop
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to court.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were there to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we have all these different
people that love cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exponentially growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get people in other
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Thailand is a great example where
they did have cannabis, but the culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that are excited about the
stuff that's going on in the West coast
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, we have this international
communication now that because of
[SPEAKER_02]: technology, you know, it's a blessing and
a curse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what folks in California,
I hope can get a greater appreciation of
[SPEAKER_01]: is the degree to which the change that we
made in California, including the passage
[SPEAKER_01]: of Prop 64 has sparked other changes all
around the world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the King of Thailand would not have
done what he did and allowed to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened in Thailand, if we hadn't
legalized cannabis here in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislature of New York and the
legislature of Illinois would not have
[SPEAKER_01]: moved forward to pass cannabis
legalization, which is what they did
[SPEAKER_01]: following the passage of legalization in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been this massive change and it's
going to take a long time for that change
[SPEAKER_01]: to spread all around the world,
but we're seeing it happen now in places
[SPEAKER_01]: like Germany and it undoubtedly will
spread all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're moving towards the day and gee,
I hope I could say I thought it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen in my lifetime, but I'm not
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the day will come when we have a
globalized and normalized cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, different strains
of cannabis are going to be grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: different microclimates that are most
well-adapted to those particular strains
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that's missing in the
North American market right now is long
[SPEAKER_01]: maturing exotic Ceceva strains,
like the hazes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find a real haze,
you're going to pay through the nose for
[SPEAKER_01]: it because it takes forever to mature,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to cost the grower twice as
much to produce per gram, maybe three
[SPEAKER_01]: times as much to produce per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're paying for lights,
you're paying for stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not really possible to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Jamaica, it's 12, 12, 365.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sweet spot for Jamaica,
and they have these beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful, super tall mountains,
the Blue Mountains, where some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive coffee in the world is grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my prediction is that Jamaica,
one day, if the government of Jamaica sees
[SPEAKER_01]: the value in doing things like creating
and granting appellations and supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaicans and developing their own
consumer-facing brands, is that Jamaica
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes the world's leading source for the
most exotic, most expensive, most
[SPEAKER_01]: hard-to-find, long-growing mature Cecevas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really nice position to be
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see all the other islands
in the Caribbean get on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know St. Vincent and Trinidad,
I think they have ambitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If decriminalization never took place in
Jamaica, these other countries wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: start to be opening up their doors as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for sure, they're really having the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're honestly having the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the people feel good about
what is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all about regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the cannabis community, with the
Rastafari community, our position that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have taken as Rastafari in Jamaica,
it's a self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of this is just coming from the
fact that we see ourselves as a nation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And which is why, another reason why I
connected to Steve, because what he was
[SPEAKER_03]: telling me was that he saw a plant tribe
around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that this tribe is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that this tribe in itself could
actually start to live by the teachings of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant and create a change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the change is that we would want to
see on the planet for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if we bring the plant into the
conversation in reverence, because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of... I'm not sure in every way how
these things are happening, how the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and human beings are evolving,
if there's always reverence in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it seems it's just the end of
the dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen as Rastafari where the
relationship between money and
[SPEAKER_03]: spirituality during the times of selling
ganja to the world, there was
[SPEAKER_03]: synchronicity in community development,
in spirituality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there is a template of the way how
if we give into our spirit, we will
[SPEAKER_03]: receive a lot more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not in huge houses and in excess,
but more in community, in community
[SPEAKER_03]: development.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what these plants are here
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are here for community development.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bring us all together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring us all together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the nature of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You light it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sit around the table and you're ready
to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as much as food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like on that same level,
it brings so many of us together that
[SPEAKER_02]: normally we may never cross paths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of this plant, it's a special
connection that we all share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where this vision came to me in
2019 as I was traveling around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I call the One Tribe or Plant Tribe
Vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this opportunity to go to four
different continents, about 14 different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries, hanging out with people who
consumed cannabis and loved cannabis of
[SPEAKER_01]: all different races, religions,
economic classes, educational levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: just about every thing that you could
imagine, every difference in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: family that you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came off of that tour really missing
people who I had just met, but my heart
[SPEAKER_01]: really hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started thinking about what had happened
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did I become so close in such a short
period of time?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I realized is that no matter where we
come from, our race, our religion,
[SPEAKER_01]: the language we speak, how much or how
little we've been educated or where we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been educated, the plants have spoken to
us in the same language.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned the same lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of those lessons, we've built a common
value system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever you go around the world today,
you find people who have had the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations valuing creativity over
conformity, valuing individual freedom
[SPEAKER_01]: over state or corporate authority,
valuing nature over industry, valuing
[SPEAKER_01]: peace over war, valuing love over hate,
radically including everybody and being
[SPEAKER_01]: intolerant only of intolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who we are, no matter where we are
in the world or what our background is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The UN claims that there's 300 million
regular cannabis consumers in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they got it wrong by an order of
about three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk to the US government,
they say there's 30 million Americans who
[SPEAKER_01]: have found their way to psychedelic
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about the retreats and
everything, just regular folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some public opinion polls say that 20% of
Americans have had psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extrapolate these numbers out to the whole
planet and collectively, we are as large
[SPEAKER_01]: or larger than all but the largest nations
on this planet and everything that usually
[SPEAKER_01]: divides a group of human beings,
we can transcend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question that comes to my mind now is,
okay, we've all been called.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can all feel that these
discussions are calling us to a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that purpose and what are we going
to do with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any of us can figure that
out on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there needs to be a convening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There needs to be a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to figure this out because the
future of the planet probably depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: us getting this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a collective energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes you have a lot of respect for people
who call themselves government.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you decide to self-govern,
you realize these people have a very
[SPEAKER_03]: serious job to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Self-governance is not easy, but it's the
ultimate task.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the reason why we are being led by
who is leading us because we refuse to
[SPEAKER_03]: regulate and govern ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: In places like Jamaica, those are the
impact of colonialism.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on a decolonized program and
every time you say it, white people think
[SPEAKER_03]: they are not involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the privilege is a mental disorder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not real.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been used as a tool for the broader
liberation of the human family.
[SPEAKER_03]: In places like Jamaica, abolition of
slavery was really a strategy for
[SPEAKER_03]: neo-colonialism.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was set up that way, perfectly thought
out and put together.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the main things that came out of
the abolition of slavery was how much if
[SPEAKER_03]: you disenfranchise people and discriminate
against them and then you tell them to
[SPEAKER_03]: govern themselves, they will choose
slavery over freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did that in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Jamaica, wages was what they used to
keep the Africans down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Jamaica right now,
you take a guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is minimum wage in
Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_02]: $3 an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about $2.58.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm not too far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not too far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not too far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That just increased poverty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably like about three or four months
ago, it was less than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from that strategy of
slavery where what happened is that you
[SPEAKER_03]: paid the people so low, they own no land.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the African people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The classism was set up because the
Indians got land, the Chinese got land,
[SPEAKER_03]: so everybody was being used as a tool of
differentiation and divide and rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a responsibility that we have to
recognize.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been used to play a game against
each other, and we have to decide to have
[SPEAKER_03]: that conversation amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people decide that they want to,
and this is why I spoke about the implicit
[SPEAKER_03]: bias and the subconscious colonization,
because a friend of mine, I know this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: good person, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had interactions and he's real,
coming from a real place, but he was
[SPEAKER_03]: having a conversation with another person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was telling them, you know why you
should come to Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_03]: Electricity is high.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the services are high, but labor is
cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, that cut every part of my system,
because I know that he didn't even have a
[SPEAKER_03]: clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just a businessman looking at the
real reason why you should do business
[SPEAKER_03]: here, and he needs to save his business.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is an age old 18th century issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in life, so many things are
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's one way, but until you have
experience to see it the real way,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to gauge stuff sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just like struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your kids to live a comfortable
life, but I think struggle is important to
[SPEAKER_02]: define your character and to figure out
who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you said, until you encounter what is
real, I think we have a problem with
[SPEAKER_03]: defining what real is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until we work out what that formula
is, and it's a very simple formula,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's you have to do your impact study.
[SPEAKER_03]: What has been the impact of your behavior?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does it affect others and affect
yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a real is real that you
could come to.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a real is real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in my 40s, and I wouldn't say I'm a
completely different person, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we change so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we get more experience, we understand
how fragile life can be, all these other
[SPEAKER_02]: things, and how important knowledge is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the biggest things
for me, and to really understand things
[SPEAKER_02]: thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's cannabis or psychedelics or
whatever it is, to get a real firm
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You understand things through experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with your retreat, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can schedule online,
they call you guys up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the retreat is, you can contact us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We promote people contacting us through
our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: www.rastavillage.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you will get an opportunity to
sign up, we do have them weekly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may be making some adjustment to sort
of give them a set date so we can have
[SPEAKER_03]: more people connecting to them at a
different time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have individuals and groups?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but not deliberately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because our container is community,
we rather groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our philosophy is that there is no problem
that is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: All problem belongs to the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it cancer, this, that, it is something
that is happening in our environment as
[SPEAKER_03]: human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a one love, bringing everything
into one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so once you book, an email will
then be sent to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be contacted, and we'll have a
one-on-one conversation to find out a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about who you are and clear up
any questions you would have about
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we tell you the container that we have
created for the experience that you should
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that container is mainly our approach
at the moment is not to create people who
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot integrate properly and not to
create people that will give us too much
[SPEAKER_03]: dramatic experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have learned a little bit about how
the plant works, how it interacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the time people come there,
they're having human issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not having an issue of life and
the relationship with life.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having issues between themselves,
the job, the stifling of their ego and
[SPEAKER_03]: their gifts, the non-creativity because
they're conformed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the things that they're
facing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have faced those things too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we create this container of stories and
so on that can evolve a human experience
[SPEAKER_03]: and conversation that can invoke memory
and that can almost try to release and
[SPEAKER_03]: loosen some of what people are calling
trauma.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're really, in fact, we see the
traumatic people as more teachers,
[SPEAKER_03]: people who have had an experience that can
share to allow us to evolve and themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: to evolve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to be there to cry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be there to woman man up
and to speak about your experiences as
[SPEAKER_03]: someone who has learned something about
this environment of the planet,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you have been going through it and how
we can evolve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we scratch that surface and rake
it up and allow it to come out,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we sort of introduce you to the
planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then normally when you go into those
conversations with the plant, you won't be
[SPEAKER_03]: having conversations that you have never
even touched on before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that you will, you know,
the plant is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can bring up anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, because of our journey with it,
already we kind of have a path.
[SPEAKER_03]: We asked for that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people just have an experience
that is more evolving than the experience
[SPEAKER_03]: of human pain and human issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can have a more connected experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the journey of these neighbors,
you know, these entities that we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like going on a first date.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we sort of put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go on this first date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really go on a date and bring all
the baggage of yesterday and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships that never work?
[SPEAKER_03]: You sit to know the person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is that you are going to sit
with this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's a kind of preparation
that we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we because it's a space of
drumming and it's a space of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a space of nature because the
river runs through the property.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having some problems now,
though, you know, especially with the
[SPEAKER_03]: river, because development is disguised or
destruction is disguised as development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are doing a lot of building.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we still want our family to come
together so we can pray for these rivers,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we know that any imbalance
anywhere on the planet is an imbalance to
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really a call to duty that our
retreat is about, about how we can
[SPEAKER_03]: collectively heal, you know, and but
integration is the biggest part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really we really know that for a lot
of people, you know, they come to these
[SPEAKER_03]: retreats and they are opened up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many gates are open up of the possibility
of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you come back into an office
building.
[SPEAKER_03]: You come out waiting two tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of hard to integrate
in that kind of a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our journey is about creating a
community, you know, a community that is
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to evolve even some of these job
types, you know, that actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a lot of these industries,
they are built to kill customers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to see if we can recreate,
you know, like the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I like these these exchanges
within plant medicines in a particular way
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be spiritual economics,
because it saves people, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't kill people, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of the fast food industries and
so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes the world a much, much better
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's open fire in the night,
you know, that that we keep our
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretations of ceremony.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main thing about our retreat is we
call it life is a ceremony, which simply
[SPEAKER_03]: means that it is every single moment that
you're integrating, every single moment
[SPEAKER_03]: you're holding consciousness to the
thought that you're having and the
[SPEAKER_03]: implementation of that thought,
you know, that you're putting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we try to open up,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people have come to our retreat and
didn't take the medicine and still feel in
[SPEAKER_03]: a way that they have, you know,
open up a lot of channels just through
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people need to live in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very different experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of the retreats in Jamaica
are at the kind of resorts that most folks
[SPEAKER_01]: go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the staff and facilitators are
flown in from overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is often not a whole lot of
connection to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rastafari Indigenous Village is a real
Rastafari village with elders,
[SPEAKER_01]: with children, with life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not like perfect and manicured
like a resort would be, but it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guests can go to rastavillage.com to
book the retreats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're open for individual bookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a schedule of retreats so that
we will group folks together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't see a date that works for
us, works for you, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: drop us an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we can work out that works
best for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also open to retreat organizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks who are organizing retreats and
are looking for a place that is friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: may want to check out Rastavillage and see
if we're a good fit for their needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the really distinctive features
of the village is that we keep things
[SPEAKER_01]: small and really intimate because you
can't really get to know each other and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a real cultural exchange if there's
more visitors than there are folks of the
[SPEAKER_01]: village.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's about 20 folks who live at the
village.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so generally we don't have more than
about 12 visitors at the village.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that a family or a company or
an advocacy organization that would like
[SPEAKER_01]: to have this very, very special experience
together can come down and have the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: village to themselves with as few as six
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very special place for
smaller groups to consider coming and
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have to definitely be ready for
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Authentic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a space where the conversations
are going to be curated before you come.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conversation is going to be with you when
you come and what you bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there are set agendas,
you know, of things, healing practices and
[SPEAKER_03]: so on that we will definitely offer,
but for each group, for each set of
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, it's it's us together
that is really kind of doing the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even though we're seeing a lot
of commonalities, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also seeing a lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and and people are continuing
their own relationship after they leave,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with each other and so on,
which is a very typical sound that is
[SPEAKER_03]: happening in the psychedelic space too as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are really being
connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even the people going to the
resorts and so on, all of them are having
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant is opening up a lot of
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was just talking to Steve and I
was saying to him that the big the change
[SPEAKER_03]: narrative now is integration.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the that's the that's the big
thing, you know, because when it is not
[SPEAKER_03]: legalized or they call it criminalized or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've like taken that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're getting back to the
normalization where we can have a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with anybody about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can really sit down with someone
and say to them, you know, I've engaged
[SPEAKER_03]: with these plants and it shows me this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to feel bad about it and so
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's going to normalize it
and create a space now where the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and human beings can coexist without the
corruption of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really corrupt spirituality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that is intangible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we find a way how to impose our
perceptions on it and just make it what we
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's that's normally a
very corrupted way to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perception is such a powerful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's it's it's what I personally
urge people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our our retreats are really about
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are really about how do you view your
interpretation of struggle?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as you say, how necessary has
this struggle been, you know, for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So many times you're panicking in the
moment about something that is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a few years later, you sit down
and say, man, if that thing never
[SPEAKER_03]: happened, I wouldn't be here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: This today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, last night I was having a
conversation with a young lady and she was
[SPEAKER_03]: doing I remember her name, but she was
doing these very beautiful teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at the conference, she was doing
these very beautiful teeth and different
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and it tastes amazing, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, after you were in the
conversation, it was really that a debt of
[SPEAKER_03]: our family member, you know, that really
propelled her to become this beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: soul that is sharing medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, to a lot of people, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of these struggles are really
stepping stones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and things in life happen that are bad
or good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really don't know the effect of
them till much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so we can be upset about
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but we don't know if that's really a
bad thing or or maybe a good thing that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make our lives better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you said something profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said people don't know how to live in
the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do with struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with struggle with struggle with
struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very much in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very much panicking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Immediately, they're the impact is right
now with struggle, but with with holistic
[SPEAKER_03]: and with relaxation, they can't stay in
the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're sick, the only thing
you want to do is get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't stay in the moment for that at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but with struggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fully present.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's been an honor to have you
guys on the show today, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a really good conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to sit with you, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and to see the work that the
plant is influencing you to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I think it's an amazing
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds are significant for the planet to
live, you know, every kind of seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and especially what what what
what ganja can do for the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is not much other plant that can say
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I honor the work that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just keep doing it from the right
place, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a you know, I'm blessed to be a
steward of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more than anything, I'm blessed to
be able to work in this career that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: chosen, you know, to be able to do this
for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't something that I think 20 or
30 years ago was imaginable, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with 216 and all these other things
that have really kind of evolved and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pushed the way forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's an amazing time to be
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just I'm really blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be here and be part of something
so much bigger than myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I run into young people now
who were born, you know, after Prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: was ended in the states that they live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the first post Prohibition
generation now that's growing up,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, you know, that's not feeling
these wounds that weren't beaten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, they're like, there's so much
there's so much more forgiving and patient
[SPEAKER_01]: and well balanced human beings,
you know, it's it's a it's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful thing to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one more thing about Delisi Oso,
you know, I think Last Prisoner Project,
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you very much for all your
contributions to Last Prisoner Project and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that you've done, I think
getting guys like we had Uncle Rick Rich
[SPEAKER_02]: Delisi on our show not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a great character, has amazing
stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Last Prisoner Project, that was one of
the things that you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, for me, the the
inspiration for Last Prisoner Project came
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was after Prop 64 had been passed
in 2016, but before it was implemented in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and all of my competitors were running
out and getting tens of millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt like I had to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found myself in Toronto, which was at
that point the capital of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in the financial district at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the top of a fancy office tower
sitting at a very long conference table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a bunch of spreadsheets on
that table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they envisioned like literally
hundreds of tons of weed being produced
[SPEAKER_01]: and more money than you could possibly
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody sitting around that table is
feeling really good because they think
[SPEAKER_01]: that this market is going to be opening
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody sees the disaster that's coming
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody there has the slightest fear of
getting arrested at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the middle of this meeting,
my phone starts buzzing and it's my buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck's calling me from a prison in
Pennsylvania where he's doing four years,
[SPEAKER_01]: four years for bringing 14 pounds of weed
from California to Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't even bring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just accused of having helped to
arrange the the transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, you know, I I don't normally
interrupt meetings like that, but it was
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend calling from prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went out into the hall and I talked
to him and it was grim because it's grim
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk to your friends in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I walked back into the conference
room, that grimness was still clinging to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked around the room and I saw
everybody there still very happy with
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely no fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized then that if I was going to
be a part of moving this thing forward
[SPEAKER_01]: from that day forward and and creating
this new legal industry that we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that everybody that was in
prison, my friend Chuck and everybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: who was in prison on cannabis charges was
released and given a decent opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: rebuild the lives that were stolen from
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the inspiration for Last
Prisoner Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been one of the great pleasures of my
life to be able to welcome friends of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: like Richard DeLisi home again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when Richard got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember his story well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the horror at hearings,
a sentence that he got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember then, you know,
it wasn't an explicit commitment that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regarding prisoners, I was like,
OK, motherfuckers, if it's on,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's on because our side's not giving
up either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really satisfying after all
those 30 years, after all the hits that so
[SPEAKER_01]: many of us took, so many of my friends
died for to see Richard DeLisi and Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Thompson and the other people who helped
build this market finally coming home to
[SPEAKER_01]: their families before they died is as it
is just one of the very most pleasurable
[SPEAKER_01]: and gratifying things that I've seen in my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have an Instagram or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: RIV retreats.
[SPEAKER_03]: RIV retreats.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and the website www.RastaBillage
.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: On there, you will see our number
1-8-7-6-2-8-5-4-7-5-0.
[SPEAKER_03]: We normally use WhatsApp, so that's a good
way how to just message us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more easier than calling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll respond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to joining you guys in
Jamaica one of these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: James Loud, you'll be proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bless you.
Thank you.
