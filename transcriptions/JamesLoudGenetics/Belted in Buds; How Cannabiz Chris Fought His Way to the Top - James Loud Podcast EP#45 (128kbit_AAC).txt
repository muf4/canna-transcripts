[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today our special guest is Cannabis Chris
from SF Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, James?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, player?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking about it for a while
and it finally happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you bringing me out to your
fucking coffee table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a bunch of joints here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the James Loud in a background,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know what time it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a little project today that we're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a little game show,
game show feel to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we're going to taste test five
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them do not have SF Kana flour in
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of them do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to test your skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go through some flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about things that make
joints good and joints bad and all kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do a lot of smoking in
the next hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I came to the right place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, but let's start off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a little bit about yourself,
how you got started in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been here a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been here a while, predominantly under the
table with it and pushing a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we stuck it out through the whole
covid shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you know, the long story short
is we're still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still pumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of shit in store for y'all in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, we're making big strides to get
back some amazing flavors on the shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, share it with the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys have been known for your top
shelf flour ever since, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since Bernie called me up and said,
God damn, you got some quality flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have made your mark with cookies,
genetics, like the actual cookies with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavors, but really pushing flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like turp chasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got a good team.
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely does some turp chasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a lot of dope turps on our on our
menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: From the cherry guavas to the Zerberts,
we've been pushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, you know, we perfected
Zerber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we might not have been the creators
of Zerber, but we perfected the
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucking Zerber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we blew that bitch up to where I seen
a whole lot of movement in Zerber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people were like pushing their
Zerber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the more of the cherry came out
and, you know, we killed it with our lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry gelatos and just how we got a
phenomenal motherfucking cultivation team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy to push a product when you
got dope, the dope shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you don't have to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sells itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bag of peel, nose, ash, all the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, man, James Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a lot of stuff going on
besides SF Canada, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Lydia in the City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got all kinds of other projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got some events popping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Litty in the City is one of the cult
followings, which is a fucking session on
[SPEAKER_01]: steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your event in Las Vegas was next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a whole hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottom floor of the hotel was
completely decked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people did you have show up?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was probably like 12 to 15,
I think, throughout the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pretty dope turnout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering it was like an old school
session on steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we have the fucking
entertainment, the cars out front.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we spent a lot on that event to
make it happen because Vegas will break
[SPEAKER_01]: your fucking pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, it came out doper than we
expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first time we had the oil
wrestling installment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not the last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know a lot of I guess
people brought in a lot of flour before,
[SPEAKER_02]: but now I think there's good weed
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegas is no exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely been getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of wave makers from Cali pull
up there, as we usually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring the fucking wave with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we like to extend our olive
branch to the locals out there that do
[SPEAKER_01]: their own shit, that make their own waves
in Nevada and Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they brought in a bunch of people as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking lit the whole night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to go on stage and do a
rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just yelling over the oil wrestling
and everything else I was doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you had so much going on,
so much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot to learn from that fucking
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's not stack too much of my own
plate when I got to do when I got to host
[SPEAKER_01]: an event and run an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correcting my mistakes from the last event
that nobody would notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we knew we noticed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what Vegas is anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like sensory overload.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys just took that Vegas,
brought it up a notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was at champs like a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This last champs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was fucking popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Champs is only getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about MJ BizCon, but champs
is only getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shout out to my boy Nick for getting
me in there with the media pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are walking around smoking,
trapping, trapping THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA is the big thing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how long that lasts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the Zotix crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Marty Grimes and the Marty
Missleman, everybody that was out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Hill, all the motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that I would usually see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get Marty on the show with the
missile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marty needs to get on the show with the
missile, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marty, I'm going to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's dive into some of these
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start out with this first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit smaller, but I figure we
could talk about drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could talk about white ash and we could
talk about flavor and we could talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: the refire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause to me, those are all important when
it comes to smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighten it up properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were rolled by professional joint
roller at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Professional joint roller.
[SPEAKER_02]: His Instagram is professional joint
roller.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me, I think if it's the same guy,
you've given me a couple of these to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were rolled superb, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Chris approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dig?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the bartender.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make some mean drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some fresh squeezed orange juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's SF Canna or not SF Canna?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor's good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Combustion off the spark of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too crazy, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a nine out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turp wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, uh, Oh, we're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, are we rating it or are we just
fucking?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, we can rate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, this is more so,
I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of 10?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turp wise, probably a good solid nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what more do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a fucking joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: If y'all can smoke this with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, the flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that long finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tap that one last time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have your own show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your own podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm slow with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's just me as you, as you got a
team here, it's just me running that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit more difficult for me
to put together a fucking team every time
[SPEAKER_01]: and get the shit popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we, we, we're going to get back
up and rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a good team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our team is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys crush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have put forth the effort and
I feel like the show's a pretty good show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I had to come on this
motherfucking strep my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so many different fucking
relationships now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how the hell do I not bring
somebody on and talk some shit and taste
[SPEAKER_01]: some flavors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're up to number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to quality, what do you
think are the most important things with
[SPEAKER_02]: flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: With flour, pulling it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing when the time is right to pull it,
you know, get it down during it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: dumbass important, you know, obviously
I've seen people with amazing flour that
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck up the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many times, so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's one of the biggest
problems out there is people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these dudes are pretty, I mean,
when we first started, like some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: team was like amazing, growing great,
amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just weren't curing it the right
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to get over that little
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it takes, you know,
a little wind out your sails because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thinking your shit is looking
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you got to get it cured right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've corrected that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about like on the surface?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're looking at flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at tree, it got to be sugary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have the some amazing candy or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for at the time right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the number one checkbox?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that candy smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I believe flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nose looks, you know, ash color oil ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, oil ring is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to not be a qualifier,
but it's the same thing with white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't sold on the white ash until
the last like year and a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still I leaning into it like it's a
serious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like white ash means better quality weed
and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yo, let me tell you, there's been
multiple times where the joint is rolled a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain way and it's just not burning a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as white as you would
probably expect it or want it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple doesn't get as white ash typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone else will come and bar it up
real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shit will just burn perfectly and
have fucking white ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's a lot of variables
into making this shit burn right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe, yeah, for the most part,
if you got some fucking dumb ass white
[SPEAKER_01]: ash, you're doing something right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think that certain certain
genetics, certain flavors, they don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just part of it, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or people struggle to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or every once in a while it comes out
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't always drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it does, it's like, fuck,
I really like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a big fan of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real deal is SF Cannon crushing with
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but SF Cannon, we've been killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Skittles are winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting good numbers on our Skittles
and moving a lot of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm personally getting rid of a lot of the
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it checks the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look like your typical Skittles
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, you know, in fact,
there's a picture of it in my breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: book.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dropped a book?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you haven't seen my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, so SF Cannon is in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to James Lough for holding it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we got a good book.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, SF Cannon's Zerberts in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got all kinds of good SF Cannon
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannon Loops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did those loops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys Fino hunted 100 seeds and got so
much variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them a little bit about our
partnership, James.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do some genetics together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that you guys did some Fino
hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm creating some genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sharing genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you guys grow the best
flower in California, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Metric, in the system, one of the big
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got the best flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's other people that grow good
flower, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to knock on them because I
think there's great flower on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at scale, SF Cannon has the best
flowers in California, not just San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco, but we got a case study on the
Skittles in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some Z that was grown by SF Cannon
and our photographer Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: James Loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I need this signed, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a one kilo book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a signed copy, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, the art and science of crafting
distinctive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book just came online and yeah,
I think it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really big project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking big book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like you guys took your time
and did it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had the best people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with the best people as far
as editing, as far as layout, and so many
[SPEAKER_02]: people contributed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this book has 20 other people
that contributed something to the book,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whether it's the multiple
photographers that we had, the graphic
[SPEAKER_02]: designers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had two different graphic designers
that helped out Daniel from House of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivar and our guy, Mason, who's our
graphics guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just Dale Hunt wrote a chapter
on like basically on law and on patenting
[SPEAKER_02]: and on, you know, some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some real game from that
mother right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Schneider from Apical Biotech.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote a chapter on tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have Reggie Gaddino from Front
Range Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote the forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's the dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the guy at Steep Hill back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably wouldn't be here without
Reggie.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Reggie, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to Spanavis too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on being there.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a I'm working on this other versus
this versus event that goes ties in with
[SPEAKER_01]: these versus bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, these versus bags are I always say
are the best way for brands to collaborate
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, it doesn't take a 12
month, you know, half a year, a year and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half, you know, whatever it is,
you can get on the fucking boards
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just send me the graphics and I'll pair
you up with, you know, if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: already got a quote unquote sparring
partner or a competitor you want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: against or a brand, a different brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pair you up with somebody,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes two brands to activate the
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an eighth person, eighth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terp versus Terp, your best shit versus my
best shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here we got Terp Hogs, Skittles
versus SF Canna, Sherry Guava.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just place a vote on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The QR code, ones you like the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick public poll.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know what time it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're still backhanding Terp Hogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got our foot on our necks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would say they would say otherwise,
but I would say nah, we winning baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to tie this into an event
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five fucking events a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be like a cup style event
where somebody gets an award?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a bracket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone is going to get a fucking
belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start pushing these belts
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's going to be a versus bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going to be a versus belt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who designed the belt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I designed the whole motherfucking belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drew it up on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sent it to my guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lasered it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clap that on some leather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That belt has been making waves,
baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big waves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would take a picture with Mike Tyson
in the belt?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I took a picture of Mike Tyson
and Ric Flair with the belt, but tubes
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution been holding out on my
goddamn picture for over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the fuck, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick start of oil, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little perfumish.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little harsh on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that was SF Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have you seen these new pouches that
they're turp pouches you can buy and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're cannabis derived terpenes
and you can infuse them like sprinkle
[SPEAKER_02]: style, but it's with natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's natural style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the new new we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the humidity gel packs that
people throwing in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got this cut of super silver haze
campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably saw that from SF Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was labeled super silver haze campus
and it wasn't very super silver haze and
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they put it out as SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's infused with the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that's the candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just said it's a fucking pouch that
you sprinkle on tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't sprinkle it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put this pouch in your pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For four to six hours or 24 hours or
whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fucking soak it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soaks it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soaks it right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get it into the into the
joints, which I think is now is that
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, is it sort of like I mean,
it's comparable to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprayed isn't real terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprayed is like, I mean, not always.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like these are cannabis derived
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get the guy on the show
that does them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like so but they're real cannabis
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like they're putting orange or
watermelon or any of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these other terpenes,
they're putting actual herbs from flower
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs from cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, because it's too scientific
for me and it's like comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really comparable to fucking sprayed
terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, either way, it's it's it's not what
was grown in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, it wasn't part of your fucking
batch until you fucking set this little
[SPEAKER_01]: patch in your shit and it soaked it up
through the fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first half actually tastes pretty good
at the joint, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the second half, it's like James,
you got them all rolled up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here about to light this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an SF can of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minus the infused herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first I mean, you get to experience
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got to try everything once,
but people have been putting hash black in
[SPEAKER_02]: weed for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you say I was smoked, sprayed,
sprayed, turped weed, you're out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me try some of this soaked up
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like turps on turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't super impressed with the
turps on that flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured, let's infuse them and see
what these things do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about real cannabis turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a taste to it, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a taste that it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tasted it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put the joint out immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tasted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was a hell of bad, but it's that
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of what I was going for.
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll go right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a couple of rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't taste natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste natural, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think when you get so used to
having good flour that anything that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like even the fake stuff, I don't want to
smoke stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that bitch that rubs up on you in a
strip club who's dancing for you and she
[SPEAKER_01]: rubs her fucking tits on your face and
you're like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, these tits are hard as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch is fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad ass is fake as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Implants are turnt reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny thing is, is when you get past
the halfway point, it still tastes like
[SPEAKER_02]: that all the way down until it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know how with Skittles,
Skittles taste like Skittles, but it
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes like if you smoke a whole joint of
Skittles, it gets more intense going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's real natural all the way down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is like you could tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if you match the right turps
with like, let's say you put Skittles
[SPEAKER_02]: turps back on Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be worth trying, you know,
but like when you're taking two different
[SPEAKER_02]: flours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worth the fucking worth the try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, maybe that's the problem is that
people are just putting different turps on
[SPEAKER_01]: other turpy weed and that there's this
weird flavor that's coming off it that
[SPEAKER_01]: people know that are like, hold on,
man, this shit is sprayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you soak this shit up with a little
pouch that James Lowe was telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always so it's funny with different
things like sprayed weed or moon rocks or
[SPEAKER_02]: we we had, you know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's snowballs now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snowballs, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but besides being curious,
like it's worth trying once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, no, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did every kind of dab we could possibly
do back in the day, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the snowballs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my boy Zach and all them cats,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's we smoked a whole Marty
missile of the snowballs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liddy in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, motherfuckers were
dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't bad weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was just fucking harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the huddle of snowballs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use the THCA pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: They rolled the flour in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make it stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but there's a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a way for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, you know, whether you like it
or you don't like there's a lane for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about being creative in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I mean, think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a bag next to another bag and
separated two apes in one bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not like rocket
science or anything like that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but it's creative and it's kind
of like the cannabis industry is so much
[SPEAKER_01]: room for like creativity and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost do anything but make it
creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're spraying your weed,
jump off a cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spraying it with non-cannabis
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we still got one more of these to
roll or smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you rolling up over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll this fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll up this motherfucking cream leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an SF Canna rolling tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, those are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a little light on them and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: SF Canna rolling tray, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been used and abused, but it's a good
rolling tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like it with the flour mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Brent flour mill,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he makes a great product.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the futures or the
future of events are?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are fucking kind of had it
with L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to all the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a fucking bunch every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, like what I've heard is
it's too much of the same event going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's not enough thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I guess Liddy is and not to
blow not to blow my own horn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, like, we really try to
come up with something different for Liddy
[SPEAKER_01]: that we usually see at your usual events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil wrestling and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, topless rollers and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about making it more of an
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dope experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the brackets, the bracket events
where they can have multiple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's pretty cool, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's only you're doing one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why the versus shit is
going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might even tie in a tie in a local
fighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean like anybody training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like a Joe Schmo, who loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: SF Canna, who's like, yeah, I'll fucking
go three rounds for SF Canna and rep SF
[SPEAKER_01]: Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do like an open registry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have all the brands that are signing
up, do an open registry because their deck
[SPEAKER_01]: will pay for their fucking fighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check this out, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that is right off hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might know, but you might know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So diving back into this contest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this contest is going to be a bracket
16 brand fucking bracket contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five events throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we got Skittles versus SF Canna.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was sort of like the prototype
fucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They threw us in high time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to John Capetta, threw us in
high times for the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Created a dope buzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen other places try to emulate this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to happen because, A,
it don't got Cannabis Chris on this
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And B, you don't got the motherfucking
plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have a fucking connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to know the right people to make a
wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You dig what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going head to head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bracket style.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many events?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to be wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comes with a real fight though.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a real fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with a real fight.
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of your, I'm going to create a
deck for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to fucking, you know,
pay a premium because it's going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: with A, B, C, D of promotions and all the
shit that you would pay for with some
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusive shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus you'll be able to sell your product
for a hundred dollars a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And motherfuckers that do events,
events throughout the year have no problem
[SPEAKER_01]: selling that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was selling for 140 when I first
dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to come with a real fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have our SF Canada fighter and I
ain't going to be no Freddie Big because
[SPEAKER_01]: for Freddie, got fighting experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buddy Mike fucking give some pointers to
the person that's ready to go fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: three rounds for SF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might be cannabis Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm just playing a, but yeah,
we're going to have some real fights
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get dragon house involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get their cage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll, it'll be a real ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have the theatrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motherfuckers walking down to the ring
with the music playing in the spotlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selling ring size seats for a premium,
but it comes with the bags that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with our little game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had five different joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was five, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you, well, there was four that we
smoked and then we smoked the fake one
[SPEAKER_02]: with the fakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did smoke five joints, but there's
four here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these, of these five was not SF
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to name the strains from SF
Canada besides this one, what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry Guava, Zerber and GX.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or vice versa mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: The GG.
[SPEAKER_02]: GG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the GG number four, which the
Guava gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guava gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guava gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That came out nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: That burns white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice oil ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been stuck in my cherry Guava and
Zerber for the last few fucking months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't been really on the Guava gas,
which is why I did not even name Guava
[SPEAKER_01]: gas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I probably would have been in my
palette, but yeah, this one's cherry Guava
[SPEAKER_01]: and this one's Zerber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this ain't us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So come on, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Piff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Piff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's well, it's just that it's
just that, but it's not SF Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, it doesn't burn the same like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, maybe growing a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a little taste, but it didn't seem
like it burned too well.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the Zerber though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zerber is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zerber is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zerber is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely had a- That's in this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zerber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Z, your Zerber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys crushing on those.
[SPEAKER_03]: The P5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I be telling people we're smoking the best
and I'll smoke in the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a fucking on my
tombstone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your favorite genetics right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides the ones you just pointed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides the ones we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zetopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zetopia is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's new.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah, it's got good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can get good color too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, flavor wise, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in effect too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stronger than Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Skittles has like,
the Z has a ceiling somewhere around here
[SPEAKER_02]: and that Zetopia can go up a little
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the, you know, the coffin candy
runs that's been popping out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: planta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I feel like the Zereals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her pops came out with like Zereals and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Zereos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Zereal milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's Zereals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a popular name.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean it's fucking tested the
fucking, it's tested the fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still here throughout all these
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, as they're smoking a bunch of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the spray turps that really
threw me off here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fucking scrambled my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, been around forever though,
Skittles, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been through lawsuits after lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got over that whole Wrigley shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still hounding them about shit
that other people will fucking come out
[SPEAKER_01]: with and trying to associate them with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Z on there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I thought it was Skittles is now Z
formerly known as Skittles or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the original Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We done fucking made that shit pop off too
in our cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when is green weed coming back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Green weed is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already damn near back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my, I feel like it's making a
comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite there yet, but it's on the
cusp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some good OGs out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Skittles doesn't always have
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the top, top shelf right
now pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think a temperature of a good
cultivation flower room?
[SPEAKER_01]: A flower room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it depends on like, if you're going
for flower and it depends on like
[SPEAKER_02]: nighttime temps and other things like
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think like your grower, he gets a
real cold and crushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have some of the most purple
flower too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He definitely crushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm thinking is like 82, you said?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What point do you think it starts turning
color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a 65?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some cultivars start turning purple
really early on and other ones much later
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some are right at the end and like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting what you can do with
getting, getting purple flower and how
[SPEAKER_02]: it's such a qualifier right now,
as far as like it's worth more money to
[SPEAKER_02]: have it purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had the same thing, it tasted
better green and you had better color and
[SPEAKER_02]: more bag of peel, you'd probably get more
money for it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who's a green weed advocate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam Ill, my boy Adam Ill, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always looking for the green weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to bring green weed back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes you got to get a little
color in there, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we got to get Adam on the show too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I've known Adam since 2010 maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid individual, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, you got a book out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be a San Francisco
fucking best time seller?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book is going to go where it's going
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco times best seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's a, you know, I think it's a
good book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it does well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I feel like it will do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I did good on the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, you know, this book weighs a
kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a weapon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2.1 something pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about a kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw that shit, literally fuck
someone up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we were talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you don't like weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking hit them with a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit them with a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in a pillowcase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking smack the shit out of somebody
in a pillowcase.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's got that soft, soft touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like an apple box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who decided that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when did you decide you was going
to come out with a book?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been working on this book for five
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and the last year, like since,
since one year ago, almost exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been heavily focused on getting this
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a lot of time and energy and,
and everything else and patience and
[SPEAKER_02]: learning how to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wrote the book five times before I
wrote the final draft of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The final, not the final, final draft,
but my, my first draft that I gave to my
[SPEAKER_02]: new editor, which was five versions in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a interesting process,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more complicated than I ever
would have thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like writing a book, what this book took
knowing now compared to what I knew five
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago is a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was like, Oh, you just brought a
book, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get someone to go take the photos
and that's done in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really that's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way more in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have a good vision for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Angela Baca, who did the editing,
she basically helped organize me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was up at 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was up at 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: working on the book for the last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started, we, she started working a
little bit later, but like she would be,
[SPEAKER_02]: she'd have questions every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like do this, this is needs to be fixed or
this needs to be rewritten or this needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to be this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by five o'clock I'd be working on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be done as quickly as I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'd take me an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'd take me four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'd take me four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before, but typically in one day
I'd do whatever she needed me to do for
[SPEAKER_02]: that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I don't think she,
she expected me to do it in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got the book done really
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rare that people could work together
and get a book done in the short time that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever get writer's block?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fuck what I'm on chapter 16,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk about cold plunging too much on my
show, so I'm not really going to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, yeah, that really got me
focusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just talking about cold plunging
with a few of my guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, bro, this cold plunging
fucking wave is hitting everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to buy a fucking,
I walked by some Home Depot shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't even a cold plunger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a metal tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, it was for gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, man, that could be my first
cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even, I'm going to tell you
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a cold type of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have a fucking full blown asthma
attack if I could jump in a fucking lake
[SPEAKER_01]: that's cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time I did cold plunge,
I mean, when I was a kid, we did cold,
[SPEAKER_02]: we used to jump in ice water and pools
that were practically frozen over.
[SPEAKER_02]: After we went in the sauna, we jump in all
that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I'm finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I'm big into the cold plunge,
but it's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it gave me, you know,
I've got a lot more mental clarity from
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do it pretty much every,
well, so I used to have brain fog pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: bad last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the brain fog is gone and I have
knee pain that doesn't bother me for the
[SPEAKER_02]: arthritis and some other shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I get good benefit from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like, I mean, I feel like
maybe it's different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something everybody should try to see
if it works for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't get sick very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking nutty, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shout out to the cold plungers of
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ones that are, that seek clarity from
smoking too much weed, like dunking into
[SPEAKER_01]: some cold fucking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Slushy temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slushy temperature water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you don't need coffee and it creates
this dopamine in your system that is like
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent of doing cocaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: For eight hours, rather than the 15
minutes you get from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get this eight hour increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like your dopamine levels increase
significantly for eight hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: six hours, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all I could say is, I'm going to
order one on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get a cold plunge here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So test somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the shorts for you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the James last shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that'd be sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our lifestyle brand is loud times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lifestyle brand is loud times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like on the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the loud times brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got all kinds of stuff that's coming
out next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some shit James loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staying busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about staying busy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you do it or do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you get knocked down,
you got to stand back up every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is like, there's that
philosophy from jujitsu is like fall down
[SPEAKER_02]: seven, stand up eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that goes across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can apply that to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get knocked down in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times are tough for some people,
but you just got to get up and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a quitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think the biggest problem
with the industry right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think people are missing the
most that are in the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they missing to be successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I think quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think quality is missing the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that quality has come up since rec
from where it was because initially it was
[SPEAKER_02]: terrible and now it's gotten better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has a long ways to go because I
feel like well, there's only a handful of
[SPEAKER_02]: good cultivators, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like at the end of the day,
there's only so much good weed out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the one, not even 1%, but like the
0.1%, the stuff that I like, the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of that on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be great if there was more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't know if there could be more
because it's like you have the cream at
[SPEAKER_01]: the very top and it's like, if there's
going to be more than prices will probably
[SPEAKER_01]: go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there should be less.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be less.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause prices, it'd be great if prices went
back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need prices up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and prices haven't changed on the
streets or in the shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the problem with dropping prices is
now it always got to be that price.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't know nothing about
fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think like, okay, if it's dropped to
18 or 19, there's always going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: NorCal Nemo's though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, NorCal Nemo's killing a game right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to write a book on how he's doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me the secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's like magic spells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exclusive book signing where he gives you
the game right then and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, look, here's the signature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit is certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Game is in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you too could sell packs at
fucking 40,000 a pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, somebody's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I'm not knocking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying like, get it fit,
you know, get it where you fit in,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a place for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killing it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know, and you know, you like that
motherfucking Skittles though,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the SF Canada, the Nemo Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you grew up in San Francisco?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunset district.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunset district.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunset Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Bernie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just gave me a double shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Chris, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunset Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how was the weed growing up?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed growing up was pretty fucking
good considering San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't grow up in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, I mean, a my tolerance is way
fucking smaller than it was right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was less quality at some point early on
when I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it only got better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was droughts when we were
younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was time where you couldn't get
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was definitely those once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I knew cultivators from the jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, dude pulled back the covers
and it was like the fucking suitcase on
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulp Fiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard the angels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, tried to break off a
piece, but it was like hella wet because I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know shit about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't smoke this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember when we were younger,
when I was younger, we would the weed was
[SPEAKER_02]: so good from this one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Kim Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was grown in like Lafayette,
Walnut Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Kim Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would they would sell it to us before
it was even people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't give a fuck because it was so
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would get it and we would still be wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you buy a three point five gram eighth
and it would shrink down like you'd lose
[SPEAKER_02]: more than half a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this stuff was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had cat piss back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tasted like nothing else I've ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever smoke cat piss back in the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not smoked cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke some cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke some cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my favorite growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what made me like weed was cat
piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd smoke it down to the roach like,
you know, the good weed we have now or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you would smoke it down to the
roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next day you fire that roach back
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ammonia and skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, cheers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate the invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're drinking on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're smoking on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing all the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Next we got to eat some mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a hell of a show, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be high as fuck, but yo,
this is a hell of a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Romulan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jake's coming on the show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02]: His father contributed to creating the
Romulan back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they still pushing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he does great work.

[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jake from Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also an amazing photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jack Herrera, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack back in the day was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack today isn't, I haven't seen the Jack
that we had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than one guy, Brett from Terraform
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he have Terraform or Terraforma?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terraform Genetics down in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a Jack that's like, old school,
funky, super strong, huge fucking buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows these huge green buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Trainwreck used to get me so
fucking blasted that I would always think
[SPEAKER_01]: it was an indica because I would just be
high as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainwreck would fuck you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was why it was called
Trainwreck too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way it grew, it was all,
I mean, pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was a satina.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Chem Dog back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that, the Champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Champelli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Peli, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Peli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta get you at the litty, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Champelli strain, the Champagne,
the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had crystals that would stick to the
bag, like line to the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, off top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: A legendary fucking name in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

Thailand right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of my friends have been to

if it's a guy's trip, then it's a guy's
[SPEAKER_01]: trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're bringing a wife,
bring the wife because it's all fun and
[SPEAKER_01]: games regardless, like amazing fucking,
visually a stunning place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if she likes to have fun at night,
bring her out to the fucking clubs and you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys all tear up the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are going to Spain hopefully,
and then maybe we'll make a trip into
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam one of these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit up one of them coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, I enjoy Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite cities in the
world to visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People there are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my friends, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all good people.
Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, in Amsterdam, I got my friend Selma.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to have like the longest dreads
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine foot long beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is an OG in the industry and created a
bunch of good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did one podcast with him a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to do one of these
days over in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing it, killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, lots of good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam, Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good weed too.

[SPEAKER_02]: Good weed, good hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hash is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think someone needs to do another high
times cannabis cup in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to bring a Liddy in a city to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did Liddy in Sin City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we go to ATL Liddy in Magic City.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try the strain of White Thorn Rose
yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oakland?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to roll deep if you're going to
Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go solo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have a group of at least 20
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuck your products, your awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no watches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought he was going to throw this shit
was beyond me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably somewhere by the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it in Richmond last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they pulled it off in Richmond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richmond's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Richmond on the water there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the Craneway?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done some cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: High Times did some events there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big ass spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's not too windy outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little windy, but as long as... Oh,
you know, Emerald Cup did that last year
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have photos together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Peli.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and you and Peli.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got high that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I smoked at least 20 joints that
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was definitely there, but who I took
photos with was... Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had your artist, the reggae
artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with Marlon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marlon Asher crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Marlon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm trying to get you on a beat,
on a track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make some music.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he'll do it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stop playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that Bob Marley movie's out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ready to go smoke some weed and go to
Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rent out a movie theater too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, where you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Jay Keir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay Keir rented out a motherfucking movie
theater and had everybody pull up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they taking dabs in the theater?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure someone was.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a private show, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So oil wrestling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These bitches were guillotine fucking UFC
choke lock submitting each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitches were tapping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 motherfuckers, including girls,
were like, oh shit, she tapping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was popping.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you weren't there, you missed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp and Hops are cousins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're related.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't cross them together,
unfortunately, but they're related.
[SPEAKER_02]: You a beer guy at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll drink beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, oh, this shit is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Hops, you like Hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like Hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like flavor in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about trying to find new flavor
experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's so many out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you get into subtleties.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, is most people, you know,
there's all these gelatos and if you're an
[SPEAKER_02]: untrained smoker, it all tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you start tasting like the
different gelatos, like you got the 33
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the 41, compared to the 45,
compared to the 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a 23 at one point, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gelatos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a 41, 43.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many gelatos?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a shit ton of gelatos.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to the untrained palate, they all
taste the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you start tasting them,
you're like, okay, this is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of 33s, way different than
the 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that's why, I mean,
yeah, like the, you know, phenol hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: taste testing, all this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't all be winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to the untrained palate and fucking
eye, it's like, yeah, oh, this was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it all tastes the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, damn, I slapped the shit out
of you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what I took to grow this
one way better than this fucking shit
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's people that just want to
get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is, is once you introduce
somebody to really good flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: then they're like, oh, that's what weed's
supposed to fucking taste like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to, you know, put them up on
game and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing when you smoke weed with
somebody that's older that hasn't smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff on that level and they do it for the
first time and it's like a aha moment,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, ah, like they figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's supposed to be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, weed's supposed to taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can taste like candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, people tell me to stop smoking
blunts and shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after I backhand the shit out of them,
I'm like, I do smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about hash holes?
[SPEAKER_02]: You big hash hole guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I fuck with hash holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to CGO.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking, they taste good and shit,
but it's like sometimes me personally with
[SPEAKER_01]: hash already inside some flour and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to put that shit out halfway
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'll just be stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to interact with nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be dumb ass high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these motherfuckers are doing that
shit 20 times within fucking the first
[SPEAKER_01]: two, three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the genetics of the future,
man, you see the OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bruno Rose, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Bruno Rose too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: The future?
[SPEAKER_02]: The future.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the future genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the people going to be going for
specific types of gelato stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to go for, you know,
obviously we're getting gas back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been there, but it'd be great
if it made a real big comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, I hate GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you go through a GMO phase where you
liked it and now you don't like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I never really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really like the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really like the name and nothing
against whoever grows the GMO or came out
[SPEAKER_01]: with GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Chem D though, Chem D was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that did like it though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon, Marlon, dude, he went through a
phase where it was like OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush, knowing him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it was GMO and
that's all he wanted was GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes this, you know, he'd get you
super ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush is always a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got that popping, let me,
uh, twist me up one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got some OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some OG in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

strongest effect from, uh, we did the
[SPEAKER_02]: loudest of 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a strongest effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has great flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's strong for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to John Mikey and Vital
Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that, uh, last joint, the last one
of the OG Kush, uh, loudest effect of
[SPEAKER_02]: 2023.

Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extra cheese.
Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm telling you the pizza.

[SPEAKER_02]: I love Capo's.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there's the difference between a
pizza connoisseur and a pizza lover.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza lover will eat all that shit and
then throw in a bunch of other shit like
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza Hut and Domino's and whatever the
fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza connoisseur will only eat at like,
you know, top fucking shelf pizza spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good ones.

[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chuck E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheese had the worst pizza when we were
kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of all the places that I liked going,

[SPEAKER_01]: Cheese's kids, but... All right,
best frozen pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do frozen pizzas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, let me put you on game.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy this frozen pizza, be like,
you know what, this one's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ain't DiGiorno, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Baron is fucking delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about that Red Baron pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Red Baron.
[SPEAKER_01]: He motherfuckers are killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted that shit on an IG like,
oh, look at this pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: No box in that picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody was like, hey, you eating
that Red Baron right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best frozen pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I make my pizza from scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like, I make the crust.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a pizza oven at the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do wood fire pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wood fire pizza?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about wood fire pizza,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood fire pizza is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ate at one of them little fucking
restaurants that are like, create your own
[SPEAKER_01]: pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like, you know, eight people over
at a time and small little party,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then you can make pizzas and as they
come out, which is only 90 seconds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could just make pizza after pizza and
everybody kind of picks their toppings
[SPEAKER_02]: and...
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 seconds?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 90 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make a pizza?
[SPEAKER_02]: At about 750.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go about 750 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comes out crisp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to rotate it a little bit,
but... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had Papa Murphy's growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the take and bake or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Papa Murphy's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take and bake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's better nowadays than it
used to be back in the days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was a kid, we used to get this
guy who worked at Round Table Pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to shout his name out
because he might not like it, but he used
[SPEAKER_02]: to put mushrooms on our pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's edit it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so we put it on the pizza,
the mushrooms, and then it was like pizza
[SPEAKER_02]: roulette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us got really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't get as high, but like... Oh,
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd split the pizza evenly between
everybody and... Sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ways to get high with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our brand that is kind of like,
it should be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we need more of a farm to
table program where you get stuff fresher
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'll get stuff from really
reputable brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the flour was good,
but then it went past his expiration
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's got to move fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also there was a way to track it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, after it gets us to a certain
point, you don't want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's like a certain point,
but that doesn't mean that it's not used
[SPEAKER_02]: for stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that happens with every brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more of the industry,
industry problem than a brand problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of problems with the
cannabis industry as it is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said Backpack Boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said Backpack Boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard Backpack Boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: James said Backpack Boys, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go easy on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backpack Boys has been killing the game,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're opening up stores too,
like San Francisco just opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, I just went to their... What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hollywood one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mansion that they fucking bought and
turned it into a goddamn dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Motherfuckers are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going online.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is THCA, but it's... What we're
smoking or what it turns into once the
[SPEAKER_01]: fire hits it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just how the farm bill was
written.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to change eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want you to know, I did a good job
picking my own shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you did a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we do the same test on Freddie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got Freddie coming on in two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should pass it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's a smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He should pass that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit next time they see us will
probably be at an event or you'll be on my
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucking podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can smoke more weed on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we could do it,
but I'm pretty fucking high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the drinks too.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, we will be getting
blasted on the Pot One show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be operating with bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big bong bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten different sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten different flavors.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten different flavors, predominantly
getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a white wall challenge with like
concentrates and, you know, keef and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever else we can throw in that bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll use fucking white out the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: No bitch hits, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like real bong rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real bong rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do hot dabs too, yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I been on hot dabs or do I do hot
dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do hot dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been on hot dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm supposed to hit up Dustin and get on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vice versa, he's supposed to be on my
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do hot dabs anymore, but I used
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when we were all young,
we probably did the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did hot knives back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just not knowing any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot knives, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had hot knives, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once in a while you would do it if you
didn't have nothing better, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to get really good Hashen hot
knife and dry sift and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a charcoal that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the charcoal with the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the hookah charcoal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you heat up with a torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be quite the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, and it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People still use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it, but you use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you were using it when I came in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a hookah in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I do have a hookah, but we don't
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to use it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say it just collects dust
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a burner and everything to fire it
up and we got all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some shisha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixed with a little bit of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people are trying to get a hold of
you, where can they find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You hit me up at cannabis, Chris415,
that's cannabis with a Z, C-A-N-N-A-B-I-Z,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris415, C-H-R-I-S415.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could find me at the Litty in the
City underscore sesh, but don't go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: double underscore anything because those
motherfuckers are fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Instagram fakes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just crazy how Instagram is so
affected in our community, especially so
[SPEAKER_02]: affected by fakes on Instagram trying to
manipulate people to go to whatever site
[SPEAKER_02]: or to give them money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Telegram links and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it didn't work, they wouldn't be
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously it's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people need to be really careful when
they go online, especially on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your favorite brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go there if they had a link to
go buy something that can't be sold on the
[SPEAKER_02]: internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys aren't doing that kind of
stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fake cannabis Chris accounts now,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking the 415 in my shit,
they switched the one to an L.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a capital I jerk saying, gosh,
it better to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got more followers than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do this again sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it on your show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, and keep it one hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got this cannabis shit confused if it
wasn't cannabis Chris approved.
