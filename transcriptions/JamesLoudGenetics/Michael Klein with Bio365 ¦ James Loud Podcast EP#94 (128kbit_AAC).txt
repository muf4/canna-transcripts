Music
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today our special guest is Michael
Klein from Bio 365.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Michael?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I saw you, was it a dead
show?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it was at Dead & Company
Shoreline in 2023, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with Shane and Tim and within those
guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seen quite a few shows over the days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many shows?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I toured full time with them from 85
to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen most of the following bands,
most of the most of the shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a couple thousand, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's never too late to have a happy
childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think of this fear?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was really impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit what was a little
disappointing for me was they didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: enough time to develop the graphics and
the limited number of graphics that they
[SPEAKER_04]: had worked up limited the setlist so that
you were seeing the same three shows
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's always time to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess they're coming back in a
couple months.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sure are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Bobby, you know,
wants to go out on stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's never going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's like my father.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father will never quit working.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father loves working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bobby's the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of the hardest workers out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's definitely he's doing better than
ever physically, mentally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's people aging in reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila, the Hash Queen, Mila Jansen,
she's another one that I feel like she's
[SPEAKER_00]: aging in reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's great when you see people
that are getting up there in years and
[SPEAKER_00]: they look younger than they did the year
before or even the year before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes even 10 years before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm up there now and appreciating,
you know, my health.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it went through a couple actually
three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a full hip replacement and I
was at Barton Hall with 20 guests,
[SPEAKER_04]: the heads of at least three of the top 10
MSOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't attend because I was in so
much pain and crutches.
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had all my guests there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us about BIO 365 and how you got
BIO 365 off the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll try and give a really brief
thumbnail on how I got to BIO 365 so you
[SPEAKER_04]: can understand how twisted I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I basically had a great life growing up
in Cleveland, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_04]: My father was very successful and he was a
little bit of a twisted old guy and he
[SPEAKER_04]: tried to guilt me into achievement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when I was 12, 14 years old,
he'd say, I hope you forgive me someday.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to worry about feeding your
children or keeping a roof over your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And frankly, I don't see you have any
reason to achieve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without achieving, I don't know how
you can feel good about yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without feeling good about yourself,
I don't know how you can ever be happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you forgive me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going, where's the money,
Dad?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I go off to college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's smarter than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's harder working than I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, I've got to get an edge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just said microprocessors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I drove down to the electronics store and
I bought a soldering iron and a MITS 8080
[SPEAKER_04]: Altair kit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started building microcomputers and
eventually started a microcomputer video
[SPEAKER_04]: game software company that did a lot of
Atari's early wall and tank type of games
[SPEAKER_04]: and was off into data communications and
software.
[SPEAKER_04]: And got really lucky, sold my first data
communications company and spun off the
[SPEAKER_04]: software from it and sold that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at 30, I retired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went, all right, I think I feel OK
about myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who the fuck am I?
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I supposed to do the rest of my
life?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was literally lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did what I think any rational human
being would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went on tour with the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: For 10 years as social director.
Amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was complete serendipity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I moved out to the Mill Valley and one of
my best friends from Cleveland moved out
[SPEAKER_04]: there at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he calls me up one day and says,
would you like to play in a flag football
[SPEAKER_04]: league?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, OK, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: This first week, we're going to play
against Bobby Weir's team.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just went into shock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I met Bob through that and became more
or less an advisor, business advisor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I partnered with Bob and Modulus Guitars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're partners in Sweetwater and TRI
Studios.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had the time and I was such a fan
that the idea of spending 120 days a year
[SPEAKER_04]: on the road with them was heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I can remember was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did that for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got into things that were really
important to me, not necessarily great
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had become a vegan and then a raw fooder
and opened up a raw food restaurant in
[SPEAKER_04]: Larkspur around 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me get back to the dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had about, I'm going to say,
10 guys from Sonoma and Mendocino who they
[SPEAKER_04]: would give us these wonderful bags and we
would give them laminates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then eventually, after 96 or whenever
the collective started up, they taught me
[SPEAKER_04]: how to grow and introduced me to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ended up starting a collective in
Sonoma, Lovell Valley Sonoma, probably
[SPEAKER_04]: around 2012.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that was my introduction to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than it had been my medicine of
preference from the age of about 12.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm constantly surprised by how many
Ohioans are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have such a strong background with
the plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, that's how I also got into
farming and soil, which is a good segue.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the raw food restaurant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine a restaurant where everything you
serve came in the door that morning as a
[SPEAKER_04]: raw fruit, nut or vegetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No cans, no bottles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to dehydrate things for two,
three days to create texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we grew a lot of our produce for the
restaurant and in our garden in Corte
[SPEAKER_04]: Madera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I learned about living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I learned that we were using compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's when I first really started
getting interested in what made a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What made a plant taste good?
[SPEAKER_04]: What made it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were these giant tomatoes from the
supermarket?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they all have no flavor at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but this ugly thing that came
out of my backyard is just bursting with
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at Shape and East.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interned there 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my experience was like,
how could this tomato taste so amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the stuff that I'm used to
tasting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my parents grew tomatoes and they were
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was even another level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's really it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also really identical for
cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I'm sure a lot of your
audience has heard the living soil story
[SPEAKER_04]: and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, just real quickly,
you know, plants spend a quarter to a
[SPEAKER_04]: third of their energy making specific food
for specific biology that lives in their
[SPEAKER_04]: root zone that cycles specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant needs magnesium.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes up the food for the microbe in
the soil that cycles magnesium and it
[SPEAKER_04]: sweats it out through its roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the microbe brings the magnesium to
the plant and exchanges it for the food
[SPEAKER_04]: that the plant makes for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way, the plant's feeding on
demand, getting all the specific nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: it needs to build the building blocks that
its DNA is wanting to express.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't want to say bad
things about salts or anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: because most of our customers use salts
and some of them grow some pretty good
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're basically filling up a bucket
and hoping that it's going to meet the
[SPEAKER_04]: needs of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant's needs are always real
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if an aphid lands on a leaf,
the plant senses it actually makes up a
[SPEAKER_04]: food for microbes that float in the air
and it sweats it out through the leaf and
[SPEAKER_04]: the microbes will come down and create a
layer of slime over the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the plant's defense that leaf
eating aphid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if 12 more aphids land on 12 other
leaves, it's got to make 12 times that
[SPEAKER_04]: specific molecule.
[SPEAKER_04]: And eventually, you know, the bucket's
going to run out of one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that giant tomato.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like cardboard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really important to me that,
you know, cannabis become more of an
[SPEAKER_04]: organic, organically grown product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the quality is better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to say that salts were force
feeding a goose, but really it's
[SPEAKER_04]: waterboarding the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just not a way to good health.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we're moving in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some people growing some organic
fire out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic and synganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like synganic is a great approach
to where they're using synthetic with
[SPEAKER_00]: organics to try to achieve a great
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at least it's a great direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you something really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were doing an early test when we
started the soil company and we were
[SPEAKER_04]: running our nutrient dense soils against
competitors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we threw in one of our nutrient light
soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically what our soil is really
all about is biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first leg of biomimicry is biology
in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a way of selective feeding
so that the plant expresses itself better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also a big part of its defenses in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the problem is a lot of good gardeners
add biology and then it drains out,
[SPEAKER_04]: drains the waste with the rest of their
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think I started to tell you
earlier, my wife in 2007 started a biochar
[SPEAKER_04]: research company and created five patents
around creating optimally temperature and
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon content and inoculating the char
with biology and with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you create biochar, you create a
ton of synthetic natural gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right in the middle of their creating
this capability, fracking came along and
[SPEAKER_04]: destroyed the business model so that they
couldn't really go forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to give the char away as a way
of sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the soil scientists from Cornell,
who was her partner, said, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just gonna take this stuff and make a
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he wanted to make a living soil and he
patented a biological activation and aging
[SPEAKER_04]: process that we do in a HEPA filtered
indoor clean space.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't use any unpasteurized manures in
any of our nutrient packages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're able to create a living base
that we mix into all of our different
[SPEAKER_04]: media.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's as clean and consistent as anything
in any substrate out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a whole community.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take our wide spectrum biology,
biochar and organic nutrients and we put
[SPEAKER_04]: them through a 30 to 45 day activation and
aging process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So number one biomimicry is, does the
plant have the biology it expects to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the interesting things is if you
don't have the biology, the plant is smart
[SPEAKER_04]: enough to stop wasting the energy of
making the food and it puts it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: biomass and that's why that tomato is
bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second leg of biomimicry is air and
water porosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because plants need space for their roots
to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our soils are remarkable in that our cocoa
is 14% solid, 24% air and 62% water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we find is we will have a
customer growing in a five gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: container and we can grow a bigger plant
in a two gallon container.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's all about root space and air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then SOPs that support those roots
filling up the container.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third thing, and this is something
that is almost absent in most hydro
[SPEAKER_04]: operations, is when it rains and when
plants get water, excuse me, from the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: with tension.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it rains there's plenty of water,
plant doesn't have to pull at all,
[SPEAKER_04]: water's just there for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day it dries out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day the plant has to pull a little
harder to get water from the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That dry strushing is probably,
if not the number one trigger of secondary
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolites, it's up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can't dry down plant in rock wool
or in a straight cocoa they don't hold
[SPEAKER_04]: water long enough, or even in a peat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having a water release curve that
mimics nature turns out to be really
[SPEAKER_04]: important for the plant to express itself
in its best.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what our soils are about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually manufacture them in not just
completely indoors, meaning all inputs,
[SPEAKER_04]: all finished product are stored indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sadly port the building so that there's
no way the internal factory can be open to
[SPEAKER_04]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, we use IPM in our
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using hypoacids mites and nematodes
for fungal control.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as clean as your grow rooms,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that shows off in its consistency and
its performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been obviously going with the ups
and downs, or I should say mostly downs of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually grown pretty successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have more than half of the top
10 MSOs, GTI, Verano, Pharmacan,
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia Care Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But more importantly for me, we have the
greatest group of foundational OGs,
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders, growers, who really understand
our soil and are growing great,
[SPEAKER_04]: great fire with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that to me is more rewarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very disappointed in what's happened
to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't honor the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's run by finance people and get rich,
quick entrepreneurs that don't understand
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant or the values that created our
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm trying to figure out how we can
get back to where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think there's any one
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of small steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a very interesting final in
business strategy at Harvard Business
[SPEAKER_04]: School.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was about a lobster boat company
that was very high tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had designed their whole fleet of
lobster boats.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a big R&D facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: They went out of business in about two
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing was, the economics of the
lobster business are determined by the
[SPEAKER_04]: economics of a boat with three guys on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's their cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they're going to sell at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no advantage to scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually disadvantages of scale,
because you're paying for all of that R&D.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying to manage all of these
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think cannabis is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The functional unit in cannabis is the
room, whether it's 1,000 or 4,000 square
[SPEAKER_04]: feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have 20 of them, you have more than
20 times the cost of one single 4,000
[SPEAKER_04]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't understand, if cultivators are
willing to furtigate, I don't understand
[SPEAKER_04]: why you can't be competitive in most
states, depending on power and what the
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor prices bottom out at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's become a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just believe that cannabis can be
grown less expensively than it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many people who have too many
magic things they're throwing in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing any real evaluation of
side by side of what they're putting in
[SPEAKER_04]: and whether it's benefiting them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They aren't really looking at system
costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of cultural practices
that have come from the old day,
[SPEAKER_04]: when we didn't have room to cultivate the
way we were trying to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you up-potted, and you shoved things
this way and that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's really no reason to plant your
clone anywhere and transplant it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason to transplant at all
after you plant your rooted clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can grow in much smaller
containers, like I said, than people are
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's big benefit to growing in
smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it's drybacks, getting oxygen to
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're learning, and we go
through these trends, whether it's using
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inputs as opposed to using three,
which I think is more common now than
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through these wild trends of,
well, this has to be better, or this is
[SPEAKER_00]: better because this person does it,
and maybe they're getting good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flowers changed a lot over the
last 10 years especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some really sticky, sticky flower
that I'll show you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not seeing that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing the really, really sticky
stuff that just you could push it onto
[SPEAKER_00]: anything and it'll stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of reasons for that,
but also the genetics of preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also bottlenecked ourselves into
this corner with- Lady's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, into this stuff that's much
different, that doesn't necessarily taste
[SPEAKER_00]: like the cannabis that we grew up with or
that I grew up with, and I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting the way people think and
the way people work and how we get so
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about one thing that we lose all
these other great things along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really happened since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the whole industry, you don't
really know what you're getting anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean- That's the biggest misconception
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I should take that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it used to be, I heard this story
that there was like 50 elders in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_04]: and people could present things to them
and they would go, yeah, that's a real
[SPEAKER_04]: sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unless you get the, from the original
breeder, it's really kind of, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: tough to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially these, the new strains that
the candy runs stuff is all tastes the
[SPEAKER_04]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's, not all of it, but a lot of
it's renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sour diesel is the best example
because for the longest time, I almost
[SPEAKER_00]: thought my mind was playing tricks on me
that I didn't remember it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a guy named Dave, I talk about
this on my podcast all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at Reagan in the river and he comes
up to me, gives me a bud and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel I remember from my childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one sour diesel that we had,
it wasn't all these different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one, I mean, maybe there was more
for other people, but back 2000 and before
[SPEAKER_00]: there was one sour diesel and I,
you know, I have some of it in my freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the sour that's going around
now is this gassy version of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what people think sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush, there's a lot of OG Kush around,
but it's not the OG Kush I remember from
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny to hear, to hear guys like Josh
D and Groves talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They talk about having a cut of TK that
nobody else has and they don't release it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I haven't smoked it,
but they like swear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some TK here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not, but it's a real TK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and it's so subjective because the
name doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fingerprinting technology is going to
help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's the beauty,
my floor of DNA and a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies where you can fingerprint the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have basically 2000 snips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can compare more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's actually more accurate than a
human fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can tell you, yes, it's that
exact thing or no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the more of us that go on board
with getting our stuff fingerprinted,
[SPEAKER_00]: the easier it's going to be down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think blockchain is going to be involved
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's, there's a lot of
technology that is coming at the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in mostly positive ways,
exception of irradiation and a few things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that, yeah, there's so little
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about that earlier that,
you know, very few of my customers really
[SPEAKER_04]: know what the impact of their inputs are
or are willing to actually push the
[SPEAKER_04]: parameters on dryback or use tensiometers
to actually take the plant to where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's not going to go into wilt,
but is really going to have to suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there's just going to be a lot
more science, I think, improving the
[SPEAKER_04]: practices.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a lot more A-B testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to do a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is testing, testing it
with most people is just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, well, this was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, they're not documenting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are people, I take that
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that are doing it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need more of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I find it really funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in Florida up until 2021 and the
product was just terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was 17 licenses, maybe 12 of them
were operating, no competition,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and now it looked like such an
attractive state, especially with rec
[SPEAKER_04]: coming, that there's some real players
down there growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some great, great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you know, Ideal out of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're growing a hundred percent organic,
just beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's real competition coming to
Florida.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hope everyone has access to good
flower at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys at Flowery, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a whole fino hunting set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunburned cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Peabud.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing his thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the great, great stories,
you know, at a 1991 Grateful Dead show at
[SPEAKER_04]: Deer Creek, Indiana, you know,
ChemDog bought a bag off of Peabud Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have somebody gifted me tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traded them for some seeds, but tickets
from both the shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the 91, 91 shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that serendipitous day changed the
cannabis that we've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changed what we see now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that, it would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I firmly believe it would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought gas to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas and, you know, the funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that and OG Gush, you know,
it was just, those are the Maitre
[SPEAKER_04]: foundational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love both of those a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have both, you know, and I also do
like some of the sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the, you know, we have the GDPs
and I get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nostalgic for me too, but I like
the skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like stuff that's really skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had cat piss when I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big thing was that really
nose burning cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't gas like OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was skunky, like a dead skunk or like a
sprayed skunk with ammonia that burned
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is what you know,
that got me excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that Kevin and Skunk VA are putting
together something where they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: do tissue culture and run nursery apps,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grateful heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grateful heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grateful heads.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're doing a breeding project
trying to bring back the old cat piss
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we're doing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what cat piss is though, cat piss is a
description of an aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lot of people don't get is like
they want to lay a flag in the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: say that was my cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you had a cat piss and maybe
this other guy did because it smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia, you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a description of a smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like blue dream where it's like a
strain name or a cultivar name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking for that one that smells
like sprayed skunk with ammonia that burns
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the years I've smelled ammonia and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the A5 haze and that was ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really good, but that was
straight ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would burn your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have that broader access,
you know, until the 2000s, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of the stuff just wasn't around.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my mentors was a guy named Jabaya
and he had a strain which was a blue dream
[SPEAKER_04]: New York Sour Diesel cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Alpha Blue is what he called it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was wonderful, but you know,
I couldn't get anybody to grow it because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's 12 weeks now and it's like...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a blue dream times a double
lemon cherry that's like a nine weeker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has everything that I love about
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're calling it a dream candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're launching that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we Fina hunted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got three different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a dead ringer for blue dream that
takes a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the one that's somewhere
in the middle where I feel like it can
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroduce blue dream to the world in a
way where some of these kids that want
[SPEAKER_00]: that lemon cherry gelato runts they'll be
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you got to sneak it in the
back door.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm building my home on Orcas Island now
and putting in a room.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lots of genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got a book for you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to hear more about Bio 365 and
telling everybody about your product
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like you have a special
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one that we did some trials side
by side and we got much bigger plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't even the one that was extremely
hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nutrient light soils, they still have
that base of biochar and biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have smaller quantity of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time you feed your salts to the
plant, our biology is going to consume
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe five or 10% and it's going to allow
the plant to signal in between your
[SPEAKER_04]: feedings and balance itself off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did this trial where we had our
nutrient dense soils going against some
[SPEAKER_04]: competitors and we had one of our nutrient
light soils in there and it actually
[SPEAKER_04]: outperformed the nutrient dense ones which
we'd never seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went back to the lab and actually
measured the respiration of the biology
[SPEAKER_04]: and saw that the biology was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people say, oh no, salts kill
biology.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, lack of water kills biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your substrate holds enough water,
the biology is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that surprises but some of our best
scale cultivators are really pushing the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant with the nutrient light soils where
they're getting the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing a lot more autoflowers out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think autoflower is slowly growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is it took this huge leap
and everybody decided they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant acres and acres and acres of it and
then they didn't get the results they were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but then a ton of people were making
seeds and everyone got excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of companies that make
really good autoflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I make great autoflower seeds
and there's a handful of other ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually putting in the work.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the largest MSOs thought that
they'd grow, they'd do two cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just use it for molecules.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the flower turned out so beautiful
they ended up selling it as flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're doubling up this year and
cutting back actually indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, you can get a lot faster
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what you're doing and you use
large enough plant numbers, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get higher yield and larger
yields per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's incredible and you can get
more harvest per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love light deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the quality of products you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love greenhouse too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like greenhouse is the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you can get an indoor looking
product for those people that need their
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not one of those guys, but I'm an
outdoor believer, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, early on, I spent a lot of time in
Colorado, maybe like 2018, 19.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Colorado every year, one of two
things would happen.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be hail and snow and freeze and
you lose 60, 70% of the crop, if not all
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the weather would be good and they'd
turn out so much that the prices would
[SPEAKER_04]: drop three, $400 a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was a feast or famine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just not enough visibility on
supply in this business to not see it tilt
[SPEAKER_04]: into oversupply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, especially with all the,
this is getting rich quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's sad for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really sad for me that the guys who
really, you know, built those foundational
[SPEAKER_04]: strains, who built the industry,
the plant as we know it, they've mostly
[SPEAKER_04]: been screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, being a head cultivator,
the biggest cultivator in California,
[SPEAKER_04]: you make the same as the chief executive's
assistant, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in California, it's not a great
living.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anybody who went into business with
their own capital got killed like
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, it's been hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I don't do cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of respect for the guys that
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing the Lord's work because the
price per pound is so low right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd much rather work on the genetic
side where I can work with everybody and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can be the Velcro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I think genetics are, you know,
for the REC operations that we work with,
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics are the only way to differentiate
themselves, you know, and that they need
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to do everything in house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally we're doing the seed
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're then licensing genetics,
selling clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to stick with that nursery
model, but I think the future is licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a loophole now, I guess,
that under the farm bill where you can
[SPEAKER_04]: ship clones and seeds anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds anywhere.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as long as it's below 0.3% THC,
you can ship it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THCA, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you could have THCA that's high,
whatever, but like they're selling,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people are selling flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA flour that tested 23% THCA,
but test below 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to know who bred that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think almost all of it is like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, and at the end it tests higher for
Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh yeah, it's a big loophole right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are, you know, people are in
denial, but they're going to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I do love the fact that you can
ship seeds freely around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, definitely in the United States,
you can go state to state without getting
[SPEAKER_00]: arrested or put in jail for a seed,
which wasn't always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is just a seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've misregulated everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can bet on them fixing
it or screwing it up worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's going to get fixed and
it's going to get screwed up worse again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Delta 8 stuff really bothers
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the ultimate get rich
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't care about the quality
of the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and as a molecule, it's not a bad
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no bad molecules in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like the get rich quick side
of it, it's just kind of disgusting
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're taking the worst of the
worst product, processing it, the worst of
[SPEAKER_00]: the worst hemp and turning it and
processing it and turning it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that will get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have some effect on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is it doing to your body?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's, you know, anybody who's
willing to jump through a loophole just to
[SPEAKER_04]: make a few bucks is not the cannabis
industry I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and then we go through
waves with everything, so it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to get worse and then
it's going to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, to which degree we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think basically going from a
schedule one to a schedule one down to
[SPEAKER_00]: rescheduling to schedule three,
I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good and bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the big deal for the industry is
the 280 because no one's making money.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one or two companies really
actually turning a real profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to have to refinance at
much higher rates than their first round
[SPEAKER_04]: of financing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just been a horror show.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 280, I think, is the most important for
the economics of the industry that has no
[SPEAKER_04]: impact on the structure or the quality of
the industry, but it'll make it viable,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm concerned that in bringing it down to
schedule three, they might put other hoops
[SPEAKER_04]: around it that make it more difficult or
more challenging for the operator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Schedule three is supposed to have all
sorts of facility rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the truth is we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done that in the past and it hasn't
always worked out for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity to do something
great.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we are improving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's just that overall frustration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did blow a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many more we'll get.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also for bio, we're now looking
at food crops expanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we developed our sales force with
the kind of expertise in one plant that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're broadening now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have always had a good microgreens
customer base.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the East, we're doing something
that we're really excited about is we're
[SPEAKER_04]: certifying our soil as pathogen free,
salmonella, listeria, E.
coli.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really it's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for controlled environment agriculture
and the food side, that's really going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think same thing with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think clones should be certified pest
and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people should put that stamp on
their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogens are such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the longest time, we were ignoring
it, pretending it didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they had to agree because it
was devastating people, it was devastating
[SPEAKER_00]: states like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we are so heavily infected
with hoplite and Veroid and Fisarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, people aren't even talking
about Fisarium right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Fisarium is a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the East, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The humidity levels are... Everybody
overwaters.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone wants to blame hoplite and to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, maybe it's hoplite
and maybe it's Fisarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's other pathogens,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, I think, over 50
registered pathogens in cannabis that they
[SPEAKER_00]: know of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used to have a data communications
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we arbitraged in international rates,
whether they were telex or fax or phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we would do is we'd go into the
customer and would say, look, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: matter what you're paying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying per telex minute or fax
minute or kilo characters of email.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your real costs are in your business
process that creates and uses those
[SPEAKER_04]: messages for running your business and
storing them and retrieving them and
[SPEAKER_04]: confirming they were delivered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where all your costs are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us paint a picture of a better world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like it, we'll implement it for
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll have much better total
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would eliminate the paper and the
people by doing things like taking an
[SPEAKER_04]: application system that would print out an
airway bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the person would take it off the
printer to a fax machine and shove it in
[SPEAKER_04]: the fax machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other side of the world,
in the freight forwarder's other office,
[SPEAKER_04]: they'd take that fax machine paper and
then stick it into... They'd key it into
[SPEAKER_04]: an application system on the other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would hook a PC up to the
application system looking like a print.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would take that printed message,
turn it into an EDI message, send it
[SPEAKER_04]: through our network, force deliver it to a
PC on the other end of the world where our
[SPEAKER_04]: PC would keyboard emulate the transaction
into their application system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so eliminating the people,
eliminating the paper, they saved so much
[SPEAKER_04]: more money than didn't matter what they
paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were locked in forever with us,
which was a nice side.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of system costs and cannabis,
I was sitting there one day with a
[SPEAKER_04]: customer going over their cultivation
costs and they were paying $2.20 for a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of gallons of my soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pot they put it in cost $4.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time they touched the pot,
they had to fill it, empty it,
[SPEAKER_04]: wash it, sterilize it, was 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were paying much more for the pot
than they were for my media, which was the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole basis of their successful
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing we tried to do is
eliminate the pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so most of our soil we deliver today
in sealed grow bags, anywhere from one and
[SPEAKER_04]: a quarter gallons up to 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you want to talk about,
you know, halfway late in Viroid,
[SPEAKER_04]: the number one vector is probably the pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can go through all the work of
sterilizing everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you might as well get rid of the pot
and save the money and the labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we can actually engineer a
bag with micro-perations in it that let it
[SPEAKER_04]: dry back beautifully, much better than
like a smart pot, which is all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, you know, we're looking at system
costs and trying to get people understand
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're spending their time,
where they're spending their dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pitch points, understanding all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many little details that
you need to be aware of when the profit
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every little cent counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and the more you scale,
the more that's noticeable too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it's a different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a completely different world
from the cocoa that I hated in the year
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000 when my buddy brought over these
bricks of cocoa that were like this and a
[SPEAKER_00]: kiddie pool and a shovel and said,
you got to break all these up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I really admire the regenerative
farmers out there who are making their own
[SPEAKER_04]: soil and really loving it and seeing the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's no question whether you're
talking Korean or bio-dynamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bio-dynamic versus KNF.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you ever had to price the labor and
the time into it, you know, obviously you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't scale it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just really hard to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heard Wrigley in Nevada is scaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do living soil 40,000 square feet or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's very difficult to scale
and maintain quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was growing for my raw food
restaurant, in order to really trust my
[SPEAKER_04]: compost, we had to buy a chicken coop and
get chickens and generate our own chicken
[SPEAKER_04]: manure and, you know, making sure you
could get clean inputs was constantly the
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And controlled environment, you know,
you're monocropping an incredible density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a giant buffet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most people won't bring compost into an
indoor or unless they're doing it
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves and they really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that just becomes, again,
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, guys, you're doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's living soil that you can get right
out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants love it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you see the industry and
substrates going in the next five to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, again, because I do believe that we're
moving forward and we're making progress,
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that the industry is going to go
towards organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to go towards better
honoring the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that comes back to biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes down to, you know, we just need,
you know, literally four or five years of
[SPEAKER_04]: the research that's going on now and for
it to really solidify.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just understand better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really confident.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do see that it has to be that has to
be a priority on the corporate level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are all getting hammered,
throwing, you know, really mediocre shit
[SPEAKER_04]: on the market and not able to
differentiate themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's not it's not that
hard.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I said, I don't I don't see
any cost advantage to the scale there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you just need really clean techniques.
[SPEAKER_04]: And clear, clear, clear SOPs that,
you know, don't just take cultural
[SPEAKER_04]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, I think that even
carries over into genetics with the SOPs
[SPEAKER_00]: and SOP specific for genetics with
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the future in empowering your
customers with information that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them better results, because at the
end of the day, quality is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think quality we can agree that quality
is what's going to make the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, having unique genetics,
but also quality quality, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter how good the genetics
are if they're not grown well,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I think that those values will
will naturally reemerge as a as a matter
[SPEAKER_04]: of of competition, actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and let's say what's happening
out in Florida is Nitin Khanna figured out
[SPEAKER_04]: how to bring in a fact, brands down to
Florida and tuck them under his license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They operate as independent cultivations,
but they're in his building and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: technically paying the salaries of the
employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like I said, that's how
ideal went in down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's some there's some
real growers down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm impressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because I feel a bit of Florida's a
home state, you know, I was embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You live in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting the dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once interstate commerce comes
into play, how do you see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so when I grew up in Ohio,
you couldn't buy California wines.
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't buy Coors beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this is 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took 20 years plus for states to
negotiate out the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Restrictions that are very similar to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, why Colorado is going to
want to give up their cultivation taxes to
[SPEAKER_04]: California?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see it happening quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with federal, if federal was to go
completely legal still, I still think the
[SPEAKER_04]: states would would would want to retain
control from from the taxation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not optimistic about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happening in the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I'd be the first one
to tell you that I have an interest in the
[SPEAKER_04]: remaining state by state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would love to go to Texas and be
be able to smoke this stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if Texas could produce their
own, I would just also be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, what I would say is that
the progress of the industry is very much
[SPEAKER_04]: been stunted by the economics of the
industry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are just trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rough right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really rough for cultivators.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost several years in a row.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forty percent of our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stopped operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it affects everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just the cultivators suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The substrate companies, the lighting
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an overabundance of some
of these markets within like even lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: and other stuff like that, where there's
so many, you know, and I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some good products, just like
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good products and bad products out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's funny that the
technology really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I see things every month,
you know, not, you know, they've got now
[SPEAKER_04]: got lights that are killing, you know,
killing pathogens in the rooms and under
[SPEAKER_04]: canopy lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the strains are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very finicky and, you know,
OGs just don't like LEDs, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't like LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like CMH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, and there's also, I mean,
again, strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and we're probably I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about this stuff,
but, you know, some of the things I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: reading is that, you know, we're seeing a
steady weakening of the genes from when we
[SPEAKER_04]: had real land race strains and the plant
is just less less able to adapt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that's true,
but the person said it was so much
[SPEAKER_04]: confidence I had to believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think land race varieties are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown in specific climates and specific
environments that serve a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think a lot of those
there, there wasn't the inbreeding that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done now to where we were
bottlenecking ourselves, like with these
[SPEAKER_00]: gelatos and stuff like that, that are,
you know, I would say that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially one of the contributions why
we have things like hoplite and virate
[SPEAKER_00]: that's such a problem is because our
genetics aren't as strong as they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember getting getting really stoned
on what was probably 12 or 14 percent,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in the 90s even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started testing,
it was like the outdoor that was 12 to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: percent was really strong and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we didn't care about percentages.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's it's become a price marker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, in the market, it's a it's
really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just is a sign of an uneducated
market, because if people are buying for
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC percentage, first of all,
that doesn't tell you the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even tell you really part of
the story other than it's going to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more high than something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I'm all about effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd love if they put a description of
how it made you feel, although that's
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, it's very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we could get an idea or the
flavor profiles, whether it's lemon or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's berries or fruit or gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's so many other
ways we could define.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's evolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard that, you know, the the gas
candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, designation is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five of them, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the way we need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in tumble, we need terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed to identify it like wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: My partner and I are really keenly
interested as to the role of terroir in
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation of cannabis versus wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: The interesting thing, though,
is that the biology you get ends up pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: much reflecting the nutrients you're
feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can start with anything, but it's
going to change based on what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: feeding it and the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're trying to nail down what that
what that really means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we go out and sample, you know,
the humble coastline, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: biology and culture it and see how it
works with some plants that were,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that was their terroir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're trying to figure out how
to do it and measure it and determine
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's sustainable or valid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's it's interesting areas
beyond my pay grade for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting to me, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because you can go up and I think
I talked about humble, but really it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like terroir is you can go from one region
to the next and you can taste sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it's the same cut and it tastes
completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, any any cultivar is both its
environment and genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't there's no two.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take the same exact genetics and
grow it two different places.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you the phenotype is
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you give you the expression
that you see at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and all these things with
environment, you could have different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have different amount of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like the minerality,
all these things as far as it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing getting into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also see this as something
where we can open this up to the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: world, where you can get a tasting
experience, go in driving up the 101 and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can stop at these farms and maybe get
a tasting experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that puts the money back into the
farmers, which is really what we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was really hopeful that that the
farmers market legislation would pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it even came up for a
vote, but I thought that was really a
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful way to support the northern
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did get approved tasting lounge
lounges, cannabis lounges got approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Gavin Newsom, love him or
hate him, he proved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you purchase at them now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you can purchase at them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe I'm not 100 percent,
but I believe you can purchase at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you obviously can't consume alcohol
and it's going to be one or and I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: they can do cannabis cafes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the concept of a cannabis cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big on putting the cannabis in the
food for myself, just personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather smoke amazing flour in a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go into delicious food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with you, but I'm sure somebody is
going to change that opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, it's a lot of creative
people out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when I was in the raw food
business, you know, what heat does is it
[SPEAKER_04]: melds flavors together and it intensifies
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets rid of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can you can take a cultural flavor
model and disassemble it and reassemble it
[SPEAKER_04]: with raw components.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just have to adjust for those that
flavor intensity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I was really intrigued with,
I was talking with a population geneticist
[SPEAKER_04]: just the other day and he was talking
about really understanding how to the
[SPEAKER_04]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: The specific expressions of specific
turpines and then go ahead and breed from
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Breed from the ability to take these,
you know, some expressions and put them
[SPEAKER_04]: together and also to vary the intensity of
the expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to talk to that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get a bunch of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's he's he was at Ancestry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was leading there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a division, which I think they
closed, which was was linking sequencing
[SPEAKER_04]: to specific health outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, with all the population
genetics type of math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we talk about the white papers
from from abstracts tech that just came
[SPEAKER_00]: out on flavorants and sulfur based
compounds that are smaller than they're
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller molecules than turpines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thiles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets me excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like breeding for those type of things,
those type of expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there is the relation to
the effect in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I love the flavor of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love smoking good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something great for every type
of occasion, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these different things in our
arsenal and we can pick and choose between
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, OK, I'm going to go do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go to a den company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes all this stuff is very it's the
slow race.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the marathon and not the
sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people want the sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're Americans and a lot of
Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they want instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's part of the problem with
the cannabis industry is it's not instant
[SPEAKER_00]: gratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get here overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, it's still beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, I mean, the fact that
we're here right now talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legally, no one's going to come
arrest us for talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll close down my bank account.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm an eternal optimist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whether the choice exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I once heard this philosophy
that the guy basically said whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: happens to you has to benefit you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he had this whole big scheme
that the universe is perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it wasn't, it would have collapsed
by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everything that happens must be
good to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but I just look at it from a practical
standpoint, is that's where you learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, that's that's the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the only thing that makes any sense to
do is to say, hey, I'm going to learn from
[SPEAKER_04]: this and we're going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have to go through enough bad
stuff to really, really understand it,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's part of getting
older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 47 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've learned I'm almost 48 next
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've learned a lot in my 48 years
about what to do and what not to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning from my mistakes, learning from
my friends mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make a certain amount of
mistakes and, you know, there's a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of suffering has to go on in your
life for you to appreciate how wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: this place really is, even in the bad
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think both both those points,
you know, the appreciation, but also the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the learning, the getting it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and my father used to say to me,
businesses don't fail because they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a reason for being.
[SPEAKER_04]: They fail because they run out of money
before they figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and and so I just I have to
believe we can do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do it much better than we're doing
it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Striving for that perfection, even though
I feel like the needle constantly is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think striving for perfection is what
life's all about, too, is I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's never going to be perfect,
but it could always be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to fall back on my.
[SPEAKER_04]: My father had all these sayings.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's called the saying sayings of Chairman
Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these really wise things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say we would say nobody is as good or
as bad as you think they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then he would say business
is about getting people to do what you
[SPEAKER_04]: need them to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're working for them or they're
working for you, whether you're selling to
[SPEAKER_04]: them or they're selling to you that is
listening and finding out what it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to take to make it work for the other
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was pretty insightful while he was
twisting me out.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is all about having good mentors and
people that we can learn from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, elders, mentors, even younger,
even younger mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning from people that are younger
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned working in the restaurant
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned amazing things from my
dishwashers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're willing to learn, there's
amazing places you can find information
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, especially cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like we had a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to make amazing food from
one of my dishwashers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of information for
your younger self going into the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: with Bio 360, what would that piece be?
[SPEAKER_04]: My dilemma with Bio 365, excuse me,
is that I'm too old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted it to happen too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to wait 10 years and I
couldn't force it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the way the industry was,
you know, we were doubling every year,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though 40% of our customers were
going out of business.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you couldn't sustain it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that was my biggest take on
the promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually went through a real,
so there's something called Klein's
[SPEAKER_04]: corollary to Murphy's law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Murphy's law is whatever can go wrong will
go wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Klein's corollary is whatever hasn't gone
wrong yet is just waiting for an
[SPEAKER_04]: inopportune time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we opened Bio 365 with two
pilot lines in New York and California in
[SPEAKER_04]: Reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we validated that we had
something and we wanted to invest in it,
[SPEAKER_04]: we built a scaled plant in Cortland,
New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that plant had a $40 a yard better
direct labor cost than the plant in
[SPEAKER_04]: Reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time, which was the end of
2019, the shipping from New York to
[SPEAKER_04]: California was $40 a yard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looked like a wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: The intelligent thing to do was to close
down the Reading plant, get rid of the
[SPEAKER_04]: overhead of the plant rent and the
manager, the stuff that wasn't direct
[SPEAKER_04]: labor, and build a new one in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Close it in January 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: And COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the freight rate tripled.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden, we were losing $200,000 a
month in freight penalty for not having
[SPEAKER_04]: the West Coast factory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we, it's COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we couldn't go out looking to find a
place till the lockups ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't find a place because logistics
warehouse space was so in demand for the
[SPEAKER_04]: logistics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ordered all the equipment, which took two
years to arrive because the control boxes
[SPEAKER_04]: were, they couldn't get the semiconductors
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we lost a phenomenal amount of
money during that period just in freight
[SPEAKER_04]: penalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was just bad luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it wasn't the wrong decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in retrospect, it might have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the toughest thing for us to
overcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's, I think that it was hard to
get the market to understand that we
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't just a commodity substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we weren't just like a charcoir or a
real cocoa or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's been our biggest challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're getting to the point
where people understand who we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they see all the people growing in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go, something must be going on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's gotten us over the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're now profitable and growing and
hope to continue, as I said, in other food
[SPEAKER_04]: crops as well as Canada's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are looking to find out more
about you, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram, LinkedIn.
