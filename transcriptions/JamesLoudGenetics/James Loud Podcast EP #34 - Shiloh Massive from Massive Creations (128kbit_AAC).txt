[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, my special guest is Shiloh Massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today, Shiloh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm great, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking forward to having you on
since we started the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super nice place you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a long history in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you work with Eddie Lep,
among other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go into starting out around
Eddie Lep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'd be a great place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lepster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, you know, I lived in
Wyoming and it was late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on a student loan repayment program
for rural areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would go serve the community for
two years and they would pay all your
[SPEAKER_00]: student loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wyoming's a different kind of level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got Jackson Hole and then
you got Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, oh, yo, can I transfer out
of this thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, can I get another spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some spots in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is right at the time that Measure
G was passing in Mendo and I was following
[SPEAKER_00]: that as like because I'm from I lived in
California a long time before I moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, Measure G, Mendocino County grow
25 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the map of the of the
programs and ones is in this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right by Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wow, that sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little did I know that it was the math
capital of the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a time that 215 is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get your doctor's note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see in the local paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, did I call this number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up on come to one of our clinics and
meet the doctor and did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, OK, this sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to I'm going to go to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put my nice shirt on, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, go to this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like driving up in its rural
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upper Lake Lucerne Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the turn and then you get to the
driveway and there's a big gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time it was open dirt road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go up around the bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you my first scene, I come around the
bend and I look over and it's just a field
[SPEAKER_00]: full of weed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's maybe under 200,
but in this era, that's a lot of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to have open in your in your yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, fuck, I remember thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I supposed to be here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this the right place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's not the right place,
this isn't the time you want to roll up on
[SPEAKER_00]: a on the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got up there and there's some other
people in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the doctor, the doctor,
old Milan Hopkins, was a Vietnam medic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you know, Eddie, like pulled him
out and was like, hey, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a lot of money off of that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people would go up there and get their
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there's fucking Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Eddie before he was Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was just like, he's a gruff dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Levi's, you know, he's not he's not
the rock star that he became later in
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swear is like, I mean, he always swore
like he hit his thumb with a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like enthusiastic because my whole
life up to this point, it's about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to convince this dude that like,
hey, this is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I get in?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think you like me too much
because Eddie wasn't a nicer type of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, I convinced him that I was
worthy or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's he's like, I'll start you off at
a yellow leaf merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little did he know that I had a resume
that well succeeded that already at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started going there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have many friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a kinship with Eddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became great friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew weed together for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And was this like late 90s?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the late 90s before it all
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, so the more momentum it
got and the more people and then the high
[SPEAKER_00]: time started coming in, it became this
juggernaut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Eddie wanted to take him on
and win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted to go big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you going to go bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real thing, what he was trying to
do was, OK, you get your script.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll grow your weed up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the weed at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like ten dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of people that are going in
there at this time are people that really
[SPEAKER_00]: need, you know, some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was it was a plan with with with
multi goals to help the people and to take
[SPEAKER_00]: on the big guy and beat the big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the year because, you know,
my son was born somewhere in there and I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of left towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was we grew 40,000 plants right
there on the side of the road on the 20th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pictures are still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pictures are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and a guy, Jason Dunlap,
was there for years with a camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a fricking five thousand hours
of Eddie lab farm footage through this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole period and all the craziness that
went on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, it led up to the point where
Eddie became the Hugh Hefner weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: His smoky jackets and his parties and his
right multiple wives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was a it was it was it was
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, you know, and then then,
you know, I moved up to Oregon for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: and I moved back in and I didn't have my
house anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually lived there, you know,
and Jack lived there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wake up every day and smoke just roll
joints up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is massive jack post stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he still had a lot to teach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just had to pay attention to
the lessons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was an epic time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic time to thought we were going to
change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you did, you know, legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, on some level,
you guys definitely had some fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an impact for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell me how you got started with
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been smoking since you were a kid,
I take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just where I grew up in the
Northwest, it was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a skateboard kid and my homie up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I shouldn't even say the name,
bleep that out, but he had a half pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, there's other kids and.
[SPEAKER_00]: His sister had like a wicked collection of
bongs, remember ceramic bongs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we kind of started smoking
around the skateboard scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were some older kids that
were in our neighborhood and they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were foster kids, but they were far
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, this is in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids had briefcase full of the
kryptonite, lime, green, crystal,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lee, insane weed when we were little kids,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just running around the woods
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the genetics back then, what kind of
stuff were you smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it was green and brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had green and brown and there was like
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we were, we didn't have that
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see that, that, that stuff till
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't, we didn't really have,
we didn't have brick weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had KGB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer green, but you got green,
but green, but indoor Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights, the G thirteens,
the Pez.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before the names started coming later,
those names, but really we called it the
[SPEAKER_00]: killers or the Cripplers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, you know, they started
coming names like Pez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd start knowing, Oh,
the Northern lights and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was green, but KGB Cripplers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was related to the
Crippy strain, but it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just called it the Cripplers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we saw names in high times
before we saw names.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the streets growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, this was, I was smoking way before
I seen a high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, and then, uh, my,
my mom used to send me down to my grandpa
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was growing up and I was like 13
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, maybe, maybe a little over 14
and, and, uh, I'd go hang out with my
[SPEAKER_00]: cousins and, and, and their dad was a
Vietnam vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my, my grandpa would take us on these
big trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go to like the air show and we'd go
to Wisconsin, da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I remember one time before we
left, my cousin, Shelly, she's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: come here and into the, into her dad's
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the closet, bro, there was a
stack of high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like high times and easy rider
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a garbage bag,
black trash bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she reached in and she's like,
she's like, grab some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I grabbed some and I grabbed high
times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she took two handfuls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took one and that just pretty much
fueled our summer as kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like, that was like that lime
green skunk bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since then I was a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, uh, and it was skunky skunk bud,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this was the brotherhood skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stuff we don't see anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you don't see that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got busted so much in that time that
it, it couldn't exist anymore because it
[SPEAKER_00]: would get you busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether you're growing it or whether
you're buying it, you could smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cat piss too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cat piss is another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those old flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a lot of the flavors back
then, I mean, it's not that we was back
[SPEAKER_03]: better back then, but I feel like in
general, there was a lot of good stuff in
[SPEAKER_03]: the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first started getting names and
stuff like that, I feel like the quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: there were more passionate people
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was, it was also more
dangerous and a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of other factors,
but I feel like there was a lot of good
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and a lot of unique flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was more diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was all kinds of sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were tertiary, tertiary turps that
have been bred into non-existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like THCP, THCH.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're finding this again in
small amounts in roadside hemp in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets you extremely high because as
a kid, like you got so high, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get the, get the lighter to the bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some other chemistry going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the plant that exists existed in such
small levels that it was obviously the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing to go with not poor breeding
practices, but a bunch of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to breed plant that don't know much
about the stuff behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't even know that that stuff exists
to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, no, but nobody's fault,
but it was just in its natural state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some things that were just more
powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the gelato hype now and the
direction the market's gone, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: completely changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's guys like Kevin Jodri.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've been following
Kevin and the stuff he's been doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like he's been on this adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in Columbia for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that looks like a legendary
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the dudes he's seen over
there and yeah, you know, big up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's the stuff that got me
excited about it in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability of maybe go on trips like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see him, he's like looking
undercover with his hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: His beard shaved like a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we need to get back into that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get some more diversity in the gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so much of this stuff has gotten
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw it happen in Europe in the late
nineties, early two thousands with the
[SPEAKER_03]: hazes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everything he's getting bred
into everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've gone into the gelatos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we need to take a step back.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second everybody started using purple
as a qualifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to throw the purple strains away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to throw the purple strains away
because they didn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that comes to the thing is
there's a fatal flaw in the testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you must've got something wrong
that, that, that if these purple strains
[SPEAKER_00]: testing into 35, 36, and they're not
getting you as high as a 20 something OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, something's wrong in the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go back and refigure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were touching on before the,
the other turps that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: still exist, but need to be found
preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not turps, but cannabinoids is what I
meant to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the TACP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and there's so many other molecules
at play, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we've been just looking at
cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just getting into the thyls,
which create like the skunky smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just saw another article came
out the other day about a whole new class
[SPEAKER_00]: of smells and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really have the time to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assumed it was probably about thyls,
but it might even be about something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I just read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a, it was an abstract tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was abstract tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell them, call them up, James,
say that's old news.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew about these styles, but no,
they really did an in-depth look at thyls
[SPEAKER_03]: and also started doing studies with people
and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to downplay terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that terpenes are valuable,
but there's other things that play for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure in the effect, especially when you're
talking about skunky things where,
[SPEAKER_03]: or like nose burning things, those,
those styles that burn your nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so small too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, small, small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now everyone's searching for
these large amounts of things when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really, it's really like the small things
that count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the small pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to, you know, admire those
moments of small moments in life as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and there's like 40,000 terpenes,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're, we're only testing 40 of
the 40,000 that are out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, we don't even really
know what's out there to the degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's such small particles of so
many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that kosher grape soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the P5.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was grown in, uh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got a good, good flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's creamy right off the get.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like creamy and a little grapey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun grown, Nevada County, the Ridge,
North San Juan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little fresh still, but,
uh, you know, I got a bunch of other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but that one, yeah, that one stands
out for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it also makes hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a really distinct flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not super bright with flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more subtle, which I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of subtlety to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's smoking right now,
which is like, I feel like this P5 is what
[SPEAKER_03]: all the new, uh, what is the P5 though?
[SPEAKER_03]: The P5 is a gelato 33 TK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, which is what Pluto is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bag seat of the Pluto bag seat of
the Pluto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pluto is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit different than the
Pluto.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Pluto is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little, uh, it's, it's
well-rounded like the Pluto, but even more
[SPEAKER_03]: so, I feel like all the gelato hybrids are
trying to be what this stuff is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a, in fact, I didn't even come
up with that quote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody said that last night when I was
in an event that we were smoking on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't, it has some,
that's a little different than,
[SPEAKER_00]: than the gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a liveliness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a, like an opener at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's floral and it has a really long
finish, which I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, this stuff's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I liked that that burns down to the
ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally you could put the joint
out, fire it up five more times and smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: the roach and it would still taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it tests above 5% turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the telltale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke it down to burn your lips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for phenol hunting, when I'm sharing
bags now, instead of giving people,
[SPEAKER_03]: flower instead of giving people flower to
do whatever they want with, I'm giving
[SPEAKER_03]: them joints and everybody gets on there on
the same even playing field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it just kind of evens out the
playing field a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it doesn't look the best,
but if you smoked it, it would beat these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things that are just like,
Oh, just a gleaming picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen more, more than once,
but then at the same time and all over
[SPEAKER_00]: goals, it's got to click the others too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the time in the funeral hunt,
we don't give it as much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and like we were going to grow a
crop for flowers totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get a little beaten down and
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a firm believer of growing it out at
least three times too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one time doesn't really tell you the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The genetics change over the period of
three generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically it'll stabilize somewhere in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, but it's a lot of work,
a lot of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the idea of coming up with some,
some guidelines like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just said, grow it three times or
like a lot of strains, like people are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, my strain and, and this and
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did, it's just like a single
cross with one, somebody else's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it should have four parents or four
generations before you can claim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you breed it at four times or it
had four distinct different parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like four generations of breeding
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a lot of the breeding out there
is just participation awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, you get this and you get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you a story about the birds
and the bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make some seeds guys,
but then the real work is in taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: to something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So making it your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause everyone's doing these F1 complex
poly hybrids that are just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's beyond the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and they're like, I have access to
good genetics and now I make good seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, you made a new cross
and that's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I'll commend anybody that
makes some good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody on seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no one owns seed making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and it's a group effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're all working on the
shoulders of the giants that came before
[SPEAKER_03]: us at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're in the infancy of this
industry to a degree, but like we're
[SPEAKER_03]: working on thousands of years worth of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're, we're, we're just,
we work for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we work for, we're working on
creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you know, we work for the
bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, it was like, we take our role way too
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ego gets in the way, you know,
I'm like, let's talk about that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we come from the two 15 and then it
got buried by, by the, the proposition 60,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: 64, 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and the first thing that went
out, out of, out the window was
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing about two 15 was
compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found your way because you believed in
the medicine and the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that, you found some people
that really needed your help and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and needed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as it changed, there was no
more compassion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When slowly, greed and ego took its place.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's still balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's people like us that are
out there still trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of warriors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big war and there's a, I'm not
going to discredit the world that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no, but like, you know, and the main thing
it's just like, we didn't get any cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually got more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got, maybe you could get it,
get, get it easier, but you didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for the guy to call you back and
drive around town.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but you know, as like, yeah,
to the retail guy, it didn't get any
[SPEAKER_03]: cheaper, but on the wholesale,
they broke everyone's backs, killed the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer, chopped them off the knees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the consolidation that's happened
over the last, and the people failing and
[SPEAKER_03]: given up, but then you see who the real
passionate people are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like, they won't do anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's a lot of people that
watch the show and there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that love weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their whole life is weed, plants,
medicine, all that cool natural stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like this is where I'm meant to be
at this time in this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my whole life, if you look back,
I talk about my 18 year old self being
[SPEAKER_03]: really happy with who I am now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've gone through all these phases and
it's like the people that love weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't, you know, you can't bypass
those weed, those, those people,
[SPEAKER_03]: or necessarily like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's happening with these big
corporations too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are like forgetting about the
passion side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just focusing on profits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's one thing to focus on
profits and care about quality and care
[SPEAKER_03]: about the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I think profits are part
of the model too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to, we're all trying to feed
our, our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody out there that doesn't love
a little bit of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of battles to pick
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They opened it up for the corporations to
come in and, and you know, corporations is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a way to form yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: To protect assets and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know you say that, that mentality of
that whole thing, but yeah, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide, worldwide, uh, militia of true
ganja people from coast to coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's young ones coming up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're super passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see these younger, I mean, I'm 46 and so
I'm seeing these guys in their twenties
[SPEAKER_03]: that are super passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been smoking weed for 10 years and
they get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get the pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not all of them, but I guess it's
like that with everything in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's, uh, let's dive into talking
about, uh, one of my favorite strains of
[SPEAKER_03]: all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, I love Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love everything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the turps on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Z train, the Z train.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny cause Skittles does have a
ceiling, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I feel like I could smoke
Skittles all day and it gets me here where
[SPEAKER_03]: some other stuff definitely either gets me
here or takes me a little higher,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Skittles is very social.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, incapacitate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very social.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for the golf course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone loves it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loves Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, I don't, I don't see what
they're all fighting about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you fighting about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are fighting over plants and
alphabet letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get over that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turps belong to the streets by now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get over that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles is a game changer though.
[SPEAKER_03]: On so many levels, as far as when I saw it
for the first time in 2014, there was,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, TGA was breeding Terpy stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of other people breeding
Terpy stuff up to that point, but when
[SPEAKER_03]: Skittles, it kind of changed the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time I smoked it to
this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Sierra Nevada reggae fest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't feeling the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he had that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, damn homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole, that's a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're all smoking cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, and it energized me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I was, I was like kind of
laying down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having some back pain came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: What up shy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoked that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like energized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that flavor was like cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changed the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I smoked it in June, 2014 at the high
times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was with Kenny Morrow from Tycom
Technologies and Noel from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Noel Nectar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nectar Noel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Noel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked to him in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great author.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done all kinds of amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was young, I was reading that
dude's shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the dude on 60 minutes that,
you know, it was all blacked out back in
[SPEAKER_03]: 96 or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I was with him and Noel at
frigging the high times cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_03]: June of 2014.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brandon came up and was like,
where was that in sack?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Rosa, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brandon came up to us and feel like it
was like, you got to try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back then there was a lot of stuff
going around with names where it didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: taste like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was described.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was so much stuff and I'm used to,
you know, I was used to this world where
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like cat piss tasted like cat piss,
you know, and skunk smelled like skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then somewhere around the 2010s,
it seems like we got the names all fucked
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies was okay though, cause at least
there was something related to cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that shit first came out was next
level fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit existed before it came out too
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was just, it was just that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mythical strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was another one that had smoked
down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be delicious if you grew it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Sunset Sherbert, it's an
interesting one because I feel like it
[SPEAKER_03]: never got its day like cookies did in
gelato did because gelato came out so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, it was like you ever been to the
races and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like Sherbert was everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was people talking about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Z just came out of fucking nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took over the fucking planet, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a, there's not a country in
the world where they don't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're allowed to go to
Antarctica, but let's not get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad went to Antarctica when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, that's the end of the
end of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You a flat earther.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, but Soma, my good friend,
my OG Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some of the most amazing
experiences with Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not convinced we're even here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is the earth flat around?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to argue theories about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to cultivate bliss within myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets to the point it's like people want
to divide and conquer so much or even
[SPEAKER_03]: separate us by Democrats and Republicans
and people with long hair and short hair
[SPEAKER_03]: and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really we're all just people at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that like weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing that we get to work with
this fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I just, I'm still, I still smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're together in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's wild because, you know,
I see a lot of people that had this vision
[SPEAKER_03]: of who they were going to be when they
were older.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is exactly what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: My homie came through from high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dog, you're one of the only
people that I knew my whole life that did
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to do as a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, and the weed, it's always
been good, but like it's pretty amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think there's some interesting
stuff still coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids are changing the game every
day, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blowing it up, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even the, even the stuff like this,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This, like we look at some of the old
school, the PIF is very popular now again,
[SPEAKER_03]: and hazels are starting to come back,
but this isn't like appealing to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people, but it's appealing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a PIF cross or the Cuban black cross
in there because they're just different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but it's a Oaxacan pineapple
time master Kush Cuban black cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pineapple time master curse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuban black case was the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me dig that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that PIF and the Cuban black,
because I've seen the PIFS one in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuban black, there's definitely some
diversity in there and some real
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't tell the story without saying
Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just different phenos of Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's haze is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: A5 Neville's haze is actually smells like
cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the closest thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of cat piss that I've ever smelled
that was this one's the Oaxacan pineapple
[SPEAKER_00]: tie master Kush Cuban black haze cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it even looks very, we were talking
about terpenaline earlier and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting high off terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like terpenaline should cause a
panic attack because it's, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you could see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to smell these side by side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smell this one first because yours has a
little bit more limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pick, I pick up the limonene and the
pining heavy on yours, where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: brighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we do a mix?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we mix this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to roll it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, we're going to smoke some sour
diesel too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some sour grown by Josh Freeman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like the best sour girl I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they, and then there's,
we were talking about miss mislabeling
[SPEAKER_00]: things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the sour that when I came
associated with the sour was actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia skunk and they were just calling
it sour diesel, but it was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many people telling the
same story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't want to tell the
truth, but, uh, yeah, this, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it was a Virginia skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so my understanding, you know,
there's a, all kinds of opinions on sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel, but sour diesel originally,
I believe was just the bag seat of the
[SPEAKER_03]: chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't breeding work that went into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the stories of my book actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's the same story that
Mojave and I talked about on a podcast a
[SPEAKER_03]: while back, but, and, uh, my buddy at root
down genetics, he has, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabby, we got to get that dude on the sour
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the kids that brought it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dudes, original dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, I mentioned all those names,
but fucking the, there's, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and there's some different things,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weasel story about the weasel and all
that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I don't even know where I
was going with that, but, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: the bag seat, sour diesel, the bag seat
and root down genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So root down genetics, my good friend,
Alan, um, who I've known for a long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: he actually has fingerprint work done for
my Florida DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has some genomics stuff done on
sour and then his genomics show six
[SPEAKER_03]: different Oakland out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, I would definitely have some of
his stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's, he's doing some real
breeding work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's, there's a handful of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just such a weird small
circle that people are like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, bro, I'm a complex
human entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't only just breed
plants and I love plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collect corn seeds and sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that stuff, but like to define
someone just by the act of, Oh bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put plants in the, and then you make
selections and then that defines your
[SPEAKER_00]: essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I just, I just love,
love that you could grow something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and like get a melon or a tree or
this weed, you know, it's, it's an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing to be able to grow stuff out
of a seed, you know, we were, we were
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be a tasty one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's going to be crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's studies about can't, uh,
terpenes that cancel them each other out
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some new stuff coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the thing is now there
can be a lot more studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many like things you could
study about the weed plant and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, anti-aging, you know, you smoke enough
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get wrinkles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some truth to all that stuff,
especially the anti-aging stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just like people overdoing
it with high power shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like dabs at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't roll with like a dab rig or
anything like that, but I, I like hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the puffco and I like the rosin
tech, the, the focus V Carta too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I'm not a hater on either one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, the technology on both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all kind of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dab ax rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other, what other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dr. Dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shredder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we used to have the volcano
electric dabs, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I, I'm back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was two sit, two 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I was sitting there with
a lot of comedy and he had turned me on to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking cold starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yo, in the future,
everyone will cold start their dad
[SPEAKER_00]: totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cold starting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever smoke it on coal back in the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with a two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like one of the ways early two
thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever vaporize with Eagle bill?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of those Amsterdam,
uh, dudes back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had that huge globe vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, do you remember that cat?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, now the Pope of dope from New
York Pope of dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know this and they
need to check it out before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was a dude and it was like in
the eighties and he ran this delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: service in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could call him and, or, and he had
wore the Pope thing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pope Adope, he had 800 number in the,
and he ran it forever, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, that's like, I was like,
this dude is on another level,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just ran this whole, uh, enterprise 800
number and, and my bicycle messengers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, people taking risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude is a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to, they need to do a
documentary about that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you doing now for work right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I got a lot of shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, my dudes at Pacific reserve,
um, we were working together and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they, they got acquired by a
collaboration ventures and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd been working together for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they reached out to me and
we, we worked some things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, uh, the head breeder over there,
we got over 200,000 square feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mixed light indoor and the new farm
and, uh, North San Juan, massive farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have like 12 dispensaries,
maybe a little more in the state and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we're vertically integrated where all
the weed we go just goes into our stores
[SPEAKER_00]: and our brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allows us to do is keep the
price down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were number one, number three and
number five in the top, uh, top fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the top 10 eight sold in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were three in the top five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it gives me a huge platform to,
to do more things and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely grow more seeds and be active
and, uh, got a lot, a big machine behind
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can really do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any product on our shelves, 85% of the
products are ours, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll, a tincture, gummies,
drinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys do everything fully vertically
integrated, fully vertically integrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, uh, yo, my guys,
they bootstrap this off 10 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they built this machine and it's just,
uh, the great evolution for the massive
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a lot of massive stuff coming
out and, uh, you know, working on some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, um, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just, uh, got a new hash lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be working more on water
hash and rosin, bringing that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's one of the things we have
been outsourcing, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have been Fino hunting too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a couple of pretty big Fino
hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was, uh, in Salinas and our,
uh, we're still in Salinas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys were some of the first in
Salinas when that whole green rush,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, blew off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're like one of, I think there's
only eight farms still in Salinas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, uh, I think it was a 36 strain
Fino hunt out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many seeds of each do you
typically pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we tried to do at least,
uh, at 10 of each, maybe, maybe there was
[SPEAKER_00]: more of certain strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, there was 50 of a few strains,
but, uh, yeah, it wasn't huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just more crack, crack to surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, see what you got,
see what you're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was overwhelming working through the
turps in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was really hard to pick things
that, that, that weren't like really
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the things just, you know,
how you had to pick because they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really fit the commercial, uh,
paradigms are all the markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of the most phenomenal weed you
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be able to get back into that
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did another Fino hunt up there in,
uh, um, North San Juan as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, uh, I think like 12
different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just up there last week testing,
uh, just different hashes and exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're doing selections,
uh, at scale, what are the selections
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the, the main traits that you're
kind of going for?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys going for nos?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we're vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, what do we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have stuff that nobody has
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a slowly massive takes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, we still have some of the hitters
from other people, but it'll be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a big portion of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we want to cover all the
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange, you know, primary colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, yeah, that's the,
that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that process, find elites that
are really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we click that, just move on to
the, to the, to the next thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, digging deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, we've been testing some
of the males just to see their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and, uh, you guys reverse
them at all, or you just, we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, we're reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we were doing, uh, a lot of
cleaning of the genetics outsourced with
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys and, uh, do a lot of redundancy
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then, uh, there's protocols for
cleaning the plants and then restarting
[SPEAKER_00]: from tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go through testing like,
uh, eight months and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: redundancy over and over for like T and T
and V and the hop and then whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: next thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and, and then by testing them
multiple times, you can see that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: clear from the system and then we can
release them back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going to, they're,
they're doomed to get infected again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but through this, you know, the,
you saw that research, they found some
[SPEAKER_00]: immune plants, plants immune to the hop
viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's the hop viroid,
something else will show up next week,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not next week, but like,
there'll be another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to stay on your toes and be
current with all this science and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and surround yourself with smart people
and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realize that you can't just do it all
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a team.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing working with a good group
of people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's motivating.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guys shred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm beyond blessed, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are just like, they shred dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's kind of amazing when you go
to these different, uh, parts of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the system and just see how big it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over, uh, 300 employees,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brian from vital, you guys use his
soil down there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we've had a long relationship with,
uh, Brian and, uh, vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's part of you guys too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an, he's an amazing human.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like him for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his soil is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got some delivery the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my seeds have been made using vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always used vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then I became friends with Brian
and then at one time I even worked with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for vital on the night shift on the
forklift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, that was, uh, that was a
good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we continue to be friends and great
products, vital garden supply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on the podcast not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, what kind of stuff are you working
on specifically this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to talk about or you
guys keep it on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we also wanted to bring some
satire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa is like, you're talking about,
well, there's a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's obviously Terps that exist
in this, uh, other side of the world weed
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't want to call sativa anymore
that aren't existing in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look for some of those
profiles that we're actually smoking right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and, uh, offer some stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some preservation stuff also for this
growing, uh, uh, consumer market of people
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 and over, you know, the boomers,
they, there's some of the weeds too strong
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a nostalgic effect of like,
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I smoked the Acapulco gold or
the, you know, that, that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't get so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't function because they're old
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, appealing to just
different demographics when they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke a whole joint and not be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like, I had a chef that I used to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the biggest demographic of emerging
consumers of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That tastes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like that combination, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the fucking massive loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should definitely, this is one of the
best ways to actually figure out what you
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke stuff together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complex and it's, uh, it's a hitter
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hits hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those ones that I feel like it
expands your chest though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those missing things is that
expando.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd the expando go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like bro bong hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bong rips like the kryptonite weed
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's strong as dabs bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, that was like some next
level shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of snappable weed
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring snappable weed back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause bongs are cool when they bubble and
they're clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge collection of bongs too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring snappable weed back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the, you asked me,
that's another thing I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime green, crystal Lee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triplers for your bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Custom tailored for bong heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I bet some of that stuff was like
18% that just rocked our world because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the flavor molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids, terpenes, just different
combinations of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, again, THC HTHCP or do the research on
your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, be surprised what you find out that
learning new stuff about cannabis every
[SPEAKER_00]: day, but THCV THCV is awesome about that
one for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some dappable THCV that's been
sitting for a couple of years and I just
[SPEAKER_03]: found it and took some dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This joint could have THCV in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it's a likely candidate for
THCV.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: THCV and CBDV.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all of these things are amazing
and it's actually considered hemp by
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hemp until it's not hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor chasers are going to love this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
It's solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit that would have you
hallucinating at a Burning Spear concert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see this giving you a little
paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was saying when I was out
there waiting and I was like, fuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: am I going to park on the street?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked the Oaxaca and I was like,
wow, I got a little racy and I was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, maybe that wasn't the best
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're safe in the compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, and I don't really dab
this kind of stuff either because it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the dabs will fucking wreck your
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least in my opinion, some of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the flavor on that's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just getting into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like with those kinds of
things, the joint changes in flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those couple of hits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it kind of really elevated from the
stuff we were smoking earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were smoking good stuff, but it's like,
it's just another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another level of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you show people those buds and
they might be like, oh, brother,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they look at it and they're like,
oh, nobody wants that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ugliest weed I ever smoked was also
the best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, yeah, that's what I always tell
the homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what's the fucking healing of
the nations?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you got your ugly weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's always got the fire,
but then he's got those Ethiopian crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want that ugly weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The uglier, the better sometimes,
especially the ones that like you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: bracts that are stacked at Fox tail out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like some of that stuff that looks
very undesirable is absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Sauer's kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauer's like on the nice end of that,
but some of this stuff looks really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: where like the budget Sauer's like that,
the one that's tolerated, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shit that will never get trimmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else did I grow that this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just in the backyard, I had some,
some all Malawi Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a mall, like the reunion islands,
it was from a seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they were, they turned out
pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in my book too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus so much on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to check it out actually
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're doing good work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's, yeah, I mean,
there's a handful of people doing really
[SPEAKER_03]: good work and there's, you know,
I liked, I liked the guys that are using
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that's outside the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, we can all breathe this stuff
that's around, but going back and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're doing the Lord's work,
going back and working with land races,
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't understand like land races or
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you think I want to work with the
land race, man, there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be like, they'll be like,
Oh yeah, he went, got the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hindu Kush lander and then he'd bring
it back and grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, bro, that's some scraggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do what you wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, it got to take one,
two, three times to master some stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: like tweak it out and, and have a large
amount of seeds in that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Mojave Richmond said once the seed
leaves the land of the races over,
[SPEAKER_03]: over, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, cause it grows specific to that
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the second you move it to a different
environment, whether it's indoors or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you're changing the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the plant naturally adapts to
its environment too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, we do too as humans,
you know, it's, it's pretty amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the land race stuff, it's like,
try to grow some Colombian and see what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens, you know, and some of these
really long flowering for 18 weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then big ups to the people that do
grow those out those 20 weeks for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a real bad-ass if you grow a 20
week plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I got a lot of respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I mean, I think a lot of people that
have 20 week plants probably cut them at
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 weeks too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I think that happens a lot
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they weren't ready for the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a whole like few more
extra fuck a month or two of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a problems that could happen occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you're flying for that long,
there's so many things that could happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one thing when you're flowering and
you have stuff that flowers for eight
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks or 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's the flavor still?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's what that's a, that's like a
top 10 joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the top 10 joint right there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice Ash too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a oil ring and nice Ash and it's
a day wrecker for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A turp ring on the Sativa banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people haven't even seen this
to make a decision themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: People make their mind up by looking at
something rather than trying to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's people that have that
interest in experimenting, trying
[SPEAKER_03]: different things, especially with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the ones that get surprised
the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're looking for an experience,
instead of just trying to do what
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody else is doing, you're going for
a new experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to find some magic out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My homie lives in Willow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what was weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been messing around for a few years
and then he loves the land races a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he showed me this strain that he
made is the Robert Creek Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed with the Congolese land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congo is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bro, it was like nuggets of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the stickiest land race I ever seen
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Omi bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, you're onto something
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, because you think of it like
one of those ones horrible to trim or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just it was like some 98,
98 chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do you know the story about the
Robert Creek Congo?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that's how I tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best that I know, but I'll probably
mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so there there's these got the
Congolese pirates running, running weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then they were like north of
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that island?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's shipwrecked on this island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this dude, Montenegro,
the black hand that was a boat mechanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he fixed these dudes boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were they were running bales of the
Congo weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he he like, you know, want to get
paid and stuff, but he wanted like a bail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he like handpicked the bail or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, he selected the seeds and
he grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck, I can't remember the island name
right now off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he grew it there forever in some
Canadian dude went there, got the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where Jodri and a lot of
people got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they called it Robert's Creek Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Robert's Creek's a place in
Canada where they were growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one by itself is one of those
nightmares to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his cross is fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big ups to him for looking outside the
box and doing something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the genetics are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a unique kind of musky muskiness
to it, along with it has the African kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of taste a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the effect is funny because Durban is
also a region in Africa and Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're talking about two
different places and they have two
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Durban kicks your your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is another one that they got to find
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring that one back.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like any we were just talking about
the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's all that licorice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that real licorice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that stuff will get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then red Congo gets you super high,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing with the Congo is it makes
me happy and laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like Durban, I think Durban is like an
ask for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo is like almost the north by Morocco,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it more in the mid?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's in the middle somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a scary time to be alive and
a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like with weed, it's just we're we're
still in the infancy of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still figuring it all out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not stabilized yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's those are the beautiful
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's enough for everybody to figure
some things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're we're we're in the best time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and struggle is real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the struggle is OK,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think people shy away from
struggle sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you just got to accept it and
they suck it up and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: evolve into better times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's just the way of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's not too many people,
you know, that have just had a pure plush
[SPEAKER_00]: upbringing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a few, but, you know,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you need that, in my opinion,
you need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the sour and the sweet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you don't appreciate the sweet
unless you experience the sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're on your own path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the tough times have made me
appreciate the good times even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's all fleeting anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nothing's promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're just here, you know,
occupate occupying space and time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're left with, what we're left with
is our last breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be a breath of anger,
could be a breath of joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you choose how do you live your life
when it at any minute could end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which choice do you want?
Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you're beginning to cold
plunging, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold plunger would be gay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it gives I I don't I used to
smoke before I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I do it first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get out of bed and I just go plunge and
I do long plunges and I'll do the short
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to think that it's one of those
things that like right now, just us
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about cold plunging is having
positive impacts on our body because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: cold plunged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that powerful that you could just
think of a time when you did it and get
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have I listen to meditation music.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I listen to this music that I've
listened to every day since I started
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, like if I have it going on my
head, I all of a sudden get super relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those ones when it's snowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best ones when it's really like
it's hard to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the summer, I fully like the cold
plunge unless you got the electric plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those best ones are just like in the
snow or psych.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really makes time stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I just I'm feeling it right
now, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I did go to Amsterdam this last
time because I hadn't seen Soma for like
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 some years and then we we linked up and
we we spent some time together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're the spa, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took us to the sauna ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I've done that many times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like that first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like the super hot one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they got all the things that
they're putting on the hot rocks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they finish it up with the towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the opium drops on you and you're
just like, oh, and then cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one is like like
pretty mellow in comparison, but the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they ended with that elangling
flower that made Chanel number five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best scents in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I never knew that there was
such a ritual around sauna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then, of course, so I was
like, yeah, you know, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: security guard you got to watch out for
this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could go over here and smoke the
hash pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's always like he's like,
OK, give me your coffee and just scoop
[SPEAKER_00]: some butter in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best just to put the butter in
your coffee before you go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he makes the most amazing brittle,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That that brittle something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a guest to have Soma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, blessed to have him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The spa experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finished and I love sauna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's a thing for my child
that in my life all the time, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's one of the things I
look forward to doing every time I go to
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram is going to the spa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just it's always a different
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so always an adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been too high at the spa
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like it gets crazy,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, yeah, that's the spa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like those would be good together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they would breed pretty good,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fires, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially because it's similar structure,
so people wouldn't be upset because they
[SPEAKER_03]: know what they're getting into from before
you started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of this stuff, if you were to
cross it with the gelato and sell seeds of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, people would be like, wait a second,
what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants look crazy, but it's like,
yeah, you know, I think there's potential
[SPEAKER_03]: for this stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to be able to appreciate a
different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like, like, but like you said,
if it was an enjoyment and people didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see it in one another, that one might be
too strong for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be just really racy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really racy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a good fricking profile,
but then I feel like it kind of mellows
[SPEAKER_03]: out, too, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think I was more high like a
little bit ago, and now I'm more like,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's funny how extracts have evolved
into rosin carts, like where we were in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I first started seeing hash
was in the 90s to extract trichome
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was doing the original BHO before
anybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got into rosin and now they're putting
in carts, capturing turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are really good as a jetty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do a great job with their cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Tiva one, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's my morning pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was lucky enough to move to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wish it wouldn't have been the end
of an era, but the end of the great era of
[SPEAKER_00]: hashish when there was some just amazing
land race hashish before it became
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant on these other cultivars and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real thing, like Steve Hayes, Moroccan,
Moroccan, Lebanese, all just just
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually the guy that brought me to
to Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's another O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the character guy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just young when I moved to Amsterdam
and they were like, go to this place and
[SPEAKER_00]: meet this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just a gruff old fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just like he became my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that guy fucking taught me a lot of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me so much about hash before
it vanished off the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still hash and there's good hash,
but it's it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so much more variety of stuff
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit more about
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you live there for a while?
Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like around 2000 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like so I was always in the seeds
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I was doing with Eddie,
too, is like I can convince him about the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and then that's when Eddie's
medicinal seed started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were doing some stuff on the
side like the Beester side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some funds available and just we
had met some people and we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's the that's what we wanted
to do is move to Amsterdam and start to
[SPEAKER_00]: start a seed company, grow weed,
because that's that was the apex of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we funded it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of spots and we moved over
there and we were growing and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Don and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were like hiding out and this
and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, they were like,
OK, come down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you buy a buy a bike for 10,
10, 10 euro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was even Gilder back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was right at the end of the
Gilder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we just got to go down
here and spray paint and silver like
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we just we just raged for a while
while we were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's when I first met Soma and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to that meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back recently and
Amsterdam is way different than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was so much post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like it's like Las Vegas of
Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, the greenhouse guys
are now in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like they're telling the brothers for
sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Highland being, you know, I never thought
Thailand would be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty wild to kill people for
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even saying that.
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, too long ago, like Singapore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I hear they're changing it again
or they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all propaganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like they're changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a new president that doesn't like
it, but they're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's making too much money for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's cheap in Thailand,
except the Cali weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the greenhouse weed, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know, I got friends growing
out down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: My my buddy from NorCal Genetics,
Al.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually growing fire there,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's going to be some guys did
Al.
[SPEAKER_03]: Al's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's rocking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He moved there permanently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed Borg is there did rock it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't seen it in a minute,
but yeah, he was there in the original
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adam Dunn and I met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to have a drum and bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was on Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Cheeky Mondays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Chris Bliss was legend back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took everyone dinner once a month or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam was so wild, dude, back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I guess we're older,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I first I went to college in
London for a while and then I would take
[SPEAKER_00]: the bus and the ferry over to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took like 11 hours, nine hours or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the cheapest way you could get
there because I was a college student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just go there for the week and
stay in a hostel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just smoke hash and weed and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that was way back in the
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like ninety one or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long before I went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was a different era.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninety one's when I first started smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same year chem doc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninety one was a special year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Grateful Dead, that bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 90s was a great era for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was like the age of
enlightenment to a degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it was really special with
all the different genetics that were being
[SPEAKER_03]: created and that people were growing
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the quality improves.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we understood technology a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also thought three part was an amazing
input for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I always thought that was the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guanos and stuff and just natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I haven't thrown some chemies on
it here and there, but like that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: my my.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer organic for for the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cocoa is great now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, back in the day, soil with three
part of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, bro, back in the day, that miracle
girl that doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some old timers grow some weed that
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Kryptonite dog and like just
smell crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would knock you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not so much that the weed was so
powerful, but the chemies and the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals just dusted you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No flush.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, these guys are flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the first dudes that I
learned that shit from back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: one garbage can, one cup of Miracle Girl,
every watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you switch it to the other one at
the end and then at certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just like so that's that would be
a super low dose of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was this guy was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the he had the Alaskan Thunderfuck
back in the day and in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: late 80s, 90s in Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was he was he was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Washington, if you were doing it
back then, you had to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy or a mad genius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those dudes like hit out a little
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was usually a balance of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was some that dude was a
lunatic, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: My family, Washington, they were the
they'd been growing a long time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington got the chronic, the chronic
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem they never fucking it
would be so the humidity was so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to maintain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so blessed in California for the
humidity, especially in the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our weed, it stays perfect most of the
times, like Colorado gets too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington would ruin your sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why you got to keep that shit in the
freezer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take nugs out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be dusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just browned out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took stuff out of my freezer that
was in there for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was almost like it was frozen in the
block of ice at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd been there for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, we defrosted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was some loud buried from back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this stuff five years old still had
terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The freezers were good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freezers, great way to preserve your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't utilize the cold
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terp storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to be a game changer
in the future for the entire industry that
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking about Laganitas earlier,
but I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was I saying about Laganitas?
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying that Bill Gates now owns
Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Bill Gates, he owns Heineken,
a big chunk of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Heineken owns Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, if I'm wrong, drop a
comment and let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, shout out to Tony McGee and
Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony McGee, the legend, changed the beer
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just believed in what he
believed in and just kept doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and Jeremy Marshall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, dude, like the Jeremy kind of is
taking the reins now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's amazing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a whole different side.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many but how many times did did he
fail before he became Laganitas?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times blown the whole of the
city's septic sewers and just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but he did he started that all
from just a craft brewer set.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a frickin legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, his book, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: His book is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Delicious beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was also very early on with the
craft brew and a pioneer to bringing like
[SPEAKER_00]: craft brew culture and cold like that
craft beer culture beer circus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, yeah, the beer circus was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was they were like kind of
freaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was part of the whole beer circus
crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess is one of the coolest things I
ever went to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the food for the backstage at the
beer circus for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they took me on tour to Chicago
and L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did these circuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just that group is just they're a
different breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: All fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: They understand hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing about the guys who did the
beer circus, like Vata Beer Society,
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the people that were involved,
you know, that I was friends with this
[SPEAKER_03]: guy, Travis, who was one of the managers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody really knew how to work hard
and also have a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the beauty beauties of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you learn how to work your ass off when
you need to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also party when you need to or
want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that's what life's all
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The balance, the balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that stuff still tastes great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the sour one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was that the sour one was P.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, the sour is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's good, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of good flavors today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you think the industry is
going?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think we're going back to greenweed
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think people are going to get in where
they fit in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever they like, personal tastes and
just experimenting with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, a lot of people follow
trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is greenweed a trend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love greenweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I really like that lime green
almost just like, oh, there's something
[SPEAKER_03]: special with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think lime green has its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the TK lime green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the green bud has shades like that's
that silver green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel's got that silver super silver
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that lime green pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking nuclear dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like the old O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: cushions?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that TK was even more lime with bigger
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like that stuff.
