[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today our special guest is John from
Green Bodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing today, John?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing really good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for driving down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You missed Terp Nami, but you still made
it for the podcast this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: After leaving Vegas, I had to get up and
check in with the fam up there and get the
[SPEAKER_01]: kids set up and then come back down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back to back from Vegas to Terp
Nami to a podcast yesterday and now
[SPEAKER_05]: podcast today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't film one a week like it looks,
but a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you've been active.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was out in Michigan, then drove all the
way back to Oregon, drove down to Vegas,
[SPEAKER_04]: did the whole MJ, and then drove back up
home and then come back down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Serious driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, with the vans these days,
you can have your little studio apartment
[SPEAKER_04]: in there, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a house on wheels.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what have you been up to lately?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really just doing some work with reverse
the Sauer OG through that by a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: cams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just trying to find some good OG cam line
varieties, just because that's my favorite
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's kind of what I'm liking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's making a huge comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got some real Sauer Diesel flower in my
bag right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some good OG as well,
but OG and Sauer's and those cams are,
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like, making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not in the Bay or in LA as much as
in the hills.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guys I know from Humboldt,
the guys I know from Oregon, we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about Sauer's and OG and where can
we get the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of what we've been
talking about for a couple of decades now.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The late 90s, early 2000s, at least in
Eugene, that's what was rolling through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone was doing the Sauer Diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different than AJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the East Coast Sauer D and AJ Sauer
D.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the East Coast Sauer D that everyone
was rocking and doing their thing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of us were smoking when the OGs
came up and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, they're just super desired,
at least from the old heads that like that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we had Trinity up there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, I'm very familiar with the
Trinity, the four way, the snow,
[SPEAKER_05]: the corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the snow, dude, the corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: The corn, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got this chauffeur to remind me of
the old corn.
No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, and then we had the snow
bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of different snow buds,
but there was one from we got from Eugene
[SPEAKER_05]: that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that super cracked that one that's
not like burnt rubber and was just purple.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a little podgely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, so a lot of our genetics,
not a lot of them, but a lot of the good
[SPEAKER_05]: ones through our group of friends came
from Eugene.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we got the dog bud from Eugene,
which was the, it was a chem dog bag seed,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, West Coast dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dog was my first introduction to the
chem family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Us too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, smelled like chlorine and
gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had that actually, that Fino
still.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like a, yeah, it's wild because
it grows very much like the sour and then
[SPEAKER_05]: it finishes different, like different
structure at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've been around a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially from the areas that I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let me know what you think of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had Dave from Budgellaro with the
old school sour.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, so I was kind of thinking my mind
was playing tricks on me, uh, because so
[SPEAKER_05]: many people have shown me sour over the
last two years, especially, and I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for the sour cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this guy, Dave comes up to me at
Reagan in the river with buds in his hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, tell me what you think of this,
you know, and you can be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm like, Dave from Eugene,
Dave, no Dave from Budgellaro,
[SPEAKER_05]: different Dave.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's from, he's from Ukiah and,
uh, from Budgellaro, Dave Perkins.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also, he works for Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a star.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of those witnesses that,
that, uh, yeah, he's, he's really great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but, but he has a real deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it reminded me of the original sour
that we had when there was only one sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that the one that was going,
I mean, at least from what I knew the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the sour around Eugene, it wasn't
even really called East coast sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was called sour, you know,
and there's an amazing cut really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what's sad is I let it go just
cause I was over it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, I didn't, cause we had
other things going and I just didn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I was like, eh, whatever,
you know, I wish I wouldn't have,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, um, I was smart and gave it to a
family member and he'd gotten it back six
[SPEAKER_05]: times before they ended up getting rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had really had to go back up into
Washington to get it a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I would have did that with the
original, um, that big Sir Holy cut that
[SPEAKER_04]: was going around Eugene, this purple stem,
you know, it was, it was one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorites and you know, some of those ones
you just don't do that with over the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lost so many good things over the
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was a, there was a,
we had a shaman that was like a Romulan
[SPEAKER_05]: shaman back cross that was, you should
have been called the shaman, but it was
[SPEAKER_05]: called the shaman.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I, I could smell it to this
day, like in the back of my nose,
[SPEAKER_05]: the perfumey insensiness of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's so many like things like that,
that we had that, you know, got lost along
[SPEAKER_05]: the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't have the preservation
techniques that we have today.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't, you know, we weren't
thinking like that then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was saving a lot of things
because if I liked it, I felt like I had
[SPEAKER_04]: to save it, hold it, give it to my
friends, or at least the family that you
[SPEAKER_04]: want them to have that blessing,
you know, and that experience of what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're, you know, cause it's, it's not to
say it's rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of amazing keeper Finos that
are going around of all types of
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars, but the ones that you're,
that are drawing you from growth stage all
[SPEAKER_04]: the way to the right when you're lighting
the bong or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, right when it starts to go,
you know, like it's registering there,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a keeper there, you know,
you know, like those ones, those are the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that you can have in your jar for 10,
20 plus years, like, and always have it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, those are, I really have felt a,
you know, kind of a stewardship in my own
[SPEAKER_04]: mind to hold some of those of what I've,
what have crossed this boundary,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cause we all have our own bio
assay, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like for me, I have what works for me,
but it, you know, if it isn't strong and
[SPEAKER_04]: powerful on a terpene and a, you know,
cannabinoid level, it's probably not
[SPEAKER_04]: making it through, you know, but when they
do, and you notice all the elites that
[SPEAKER_04]: people are holding on, they are up in that
upper threshold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them are, you know, in between 20
and 30%, most of them are pretty high ter
[SPEAKER_04]: profile and unique, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think I refocused and I talk
about a lot of my podcasts, but I really
[SPEAKER_05]: refocused since 420 of this year on
effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And going back in that direction does,
how does it make me feel and how does it
[SPEAKER_05]: make other people feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've Instagram has taken us in this
direction where it's like, how does it
[SPEAKER_05]: look guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so, and it's like, but that doesn't
tell you how it tastes and how it makes
[SPEAKER_05]: you feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, there's so many things out
there effect wise that I'm revisiting
[SPEAKER_05]: where I'm like, Whoa, you know,
that creeper weed that kicks in after 15
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really gets you right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're all bugged out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, Hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you, I took a full bong rip and I
was like, I'm not even high.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took another one and then like
literally five minutes later I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, this is that creeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was some mother's weed from Johnny
at Huckleberry hill farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: That stuff is pretty special.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he has the white thorn rose,
which is very like, I've heard of that
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not indica, not sativa where, you know,
everyone wants to classify these things as
[SPEAKER_05]: indica sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hybrid in the middle and it's feel
good weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes you just feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could smoke it in the morning,
afternoon, evening, the rosin's purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something special and the effect of
it is extremely special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he has a, basically from the same
progeny, he has another plant and it does,
[SPEAKER_05]: it has a very different effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does different things to your,
to your mind and it creeps up on you and
[SPEAKER_05]: it, it makes you feel good, but it really
kind of, it's, it's a more intense version
[SPEAKER_05]: of that effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I love strands like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have the hazy Kush and I,
you know, it was actually my attempt to
[SPEAKER_04]: recreate the Big Star Holy, you know,
not different genetics, but looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: the similar effect and similar style and
morphology and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's one of those strains that like,
if you're on a good one, it'll really put
[SPEAKER_04]: you on a good one, euphoric, super
stimulating, super energizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're on a bad one and in a kind
of depressed state, it'll make you like on
[SPEAKER_04]: a bad one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: one time this, you know, this artist that
we worked with a gift of gab from
[SPEAKER_04]: blackalicious, you know, and he's passed
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rest is sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we did a show with him and my friend
gave him a chunk of hazy Kush right off
[SPEAKER_04]: the top of the jar, you know, and he went
out and smoked a joint, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and my buddy's like, Hey bro, I go,
I busted in your jar and gave him,
[SPEAKER_04]: gave him a nug, gave gab a nug.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, hopefully it wasn't that one
off the top, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all like, Oh, it was, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow, that was the hazy bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all no, you know, cause this dude,
my friend couldn't even smoke this weed
[SPEAKER_04]: cause it like, you know, kind of put them
on one, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure enough, 30 minutes into gab set,
he comes off stage cause he threw his back
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, first thing they're coming
backstage down the hall and my buddy's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Hey man, here's my Dr. John,
you know, I'm like, Hey, what's up,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all do my bag, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bag is all how to sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was like, Oh, it was like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was like, Oh, he's sounding
good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, so we, we, we worked it
out, did a meditation, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: did some breathing, you know, and then
they went, it was a new year's Eve shows
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they went out and crushed it at
new years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like it was an hour of like,
you know, sometimes we don't put a,
[SPEAKER_04]: put a hurt on someone that's not a,
you know, all day user kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so subjective to the individual
and you know, we all are so different in,
[SPEAKER_05]: in what we like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's stuff that I think we can
agree on across the board at times,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then we're also, you know,
as far as tolerances and other things like
[SPEAKER_05]: that, I mean, some people love the,
you know, the uplifting and some people
[SPEAKER_05]: love the narcotic and you can go in the
beauty of the plan is you can go in any
[SPEAKER_05]: direction with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's so many different
places.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Salads.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the salads too flavor wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I think that's coming in as
far as rosin guys blending their rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's, it's a great, they've done
it with wine and other things forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the thing is there's,
it's so, there's so many people and so
[SPEAKER_04]: many styles of chemistry, you know,
so like to be able to offer that and
[SPEAKER_04]: people have to understand their own
chemistry and what works for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like for me, I, you know,
I consistently smoke about three different
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though I may have 30 jars,
I'm literally still picking from three of
[SPEAKER_04]: those jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put, you know, a nug from each one
of those jars in my jar for the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, that's kind of like how I roll,
you know, and, and that'll change,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's some that have lasted through
time that are been that way for 10,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15, 20 years now, you know, and like,
and those ones, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and like I was, you know, I was telling
you at the show, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have definitely not, I don't consider
myself a breeder in any way, but I can
[SPEAKER_04]: select decently, you know, and what I'm
selecting and how I'm selecting,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really selecting for myself,
but because I know I'm a pretty big critic
[SPEAKER_04]: and what I can offer others through my own
selection, you know, cause I am an extreme
[SPEAKER_04]: critic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they'll appreciate it at least,
you know, and like, well, I honestly feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like that's more important than being able
to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause as a breeder, the breeding part is
doing the selection, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the end of the day, you know,
everybody's like, Oh, I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a, well, what kind of selections are
you making?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, yeah, you made some
seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But show me, show me some years of
progress and where you went with it and
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, have you improved the gene
pool or are you just, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to make some money?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's, and there's nothing
wrong with either one, but let's just be
[SPEAKER_05]: real about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like breeding, you know, in my book,
I kind of go into it as well, but the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding is really through the selection
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what makes a good breeder is
like, okay, well, you can take 50 seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can pick the best one or maybe the
best three or whatever it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and be able to have that translate into
something that's long lasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and that's why I've done I'm doing
a lot of work with the 89 NL five,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, send bud gave me these seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come from Melvin eddick's work that,
you know, they did with the 89 NL five
[SPEAKER_04]: from Neville, you know, and well,
I was kind of skeptical about it because I
[SPEAKER_04]: had some stuff from Jim from Himechiba
and, you know, before he passed and
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing, amazing NL five, but it was what
I was expecting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was what I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't as strong, you know,
it wasn't current day cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: what I was expecting, but it was what I
was expecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was expecting on a, you know,
on that kind of set, but then I had this
[SPEAKER_04]: 89 NL right by it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at first I was like, Oh, they weren't
growing as fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was kind of, you know, but then I
noticed some really interesting traits and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not kidding over the next three weeks,
the way they formed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, one of them was straight
Afghani, you know, like chocolate acrid
[SPEAKER_04]: look, you know, reminded me of purple
Bubba kind of, you know, and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: other one reminded me of a chem sour,
you know, so I was like, Oh, this I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, and what was crazy is I'm like,
Oh, this must, something must be not
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, but I was really impressed,
but I'm like, between these two plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at 80% of cannabis right now
between these two, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that can create there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily like Jorge Cervantes came into
town and came over and he stayed with me
[SPEAKER_04]: for like a week, you know, and at that
time when I had those pollinated on the
[SPEAKER_04]: deck, you know, just to, two plants on my
deck, you know, actually just cause I was
[SPEAKER_04]: just letting them go longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to do stuff with that room,
you know, you get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Hey man, can you verify
these?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you're, you were around,
you know, you were like, and he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's dude, what, you know, he was so
shocked.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got Ron Kreeft on the phone,
which is one of Neville's main
[SPEAKER_04]: apprentices, you know, how we are on like
FaceTiming and he was, they were just
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I was just tripping, you know,
cause, cause the level of quality,
[SPEAKER_04]: then that made sense how the lore made it
that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: So putting that into it, you'll see some
stuff from over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've put that by a lot of things and
you know, things like the sour best shit
[SPEAKER_04]: ever, which is, you know, there's a lot
of, you know, misinformation about that
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, it's one of the best OG
cuts, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like putting the 89NL to that,
making these super stinky chem,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, very interesting, you know,
like I, it's kind of to see and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and, you know, Jimmy from our
original readers league, he did a huge,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he did his huge thing,
you know, very beautiful, impressive
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but did some, you know, testing on
the 89NL and that was extremely stable,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I see the breeding trueness
through all the breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It creates such beautiful potential,
but still holds true a lot of its
[SPEAKER_04]: morphology, a lot of its tendencies,
which in that case is good, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm trying to basically bring that
into all the, the current day elites and
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of re-vigorate, re-vigorate the,
you know, not say I'm like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make the gene pool better or
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're not taking away from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like, you know, I'm doing
something similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking old school cuts and mirroring
it to new school cuts, Fort Collins coughs
[SPEAKER_05]: and the old chems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really liked that approach because I
feel like we're bottlenecking ourselves
[SPEAKER_05]: into these gelatos and runs and skittles
and these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we tend to do that just as,
as it's human nature, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we like something when we double down
on it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I mean, with medicine, it's like,
Oh, it works good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's take twice as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that, that's just human nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay with mushrooms, but most other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you'll learn real quick,
you know, but medicinal mushrooms are
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, like lion's man stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I heard Michael Cimbio talking,
he's like, you should be eating so much of
[SPEAKER_04]: those that you smell like mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, that sounds medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds extremely medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sweating, sweating lion's mane
smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love being able to sneak old school
stuff into the new market where it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: people like, Oh yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I have a blue dream,
a double lemon cherry, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That has a little bit of that blue,
what's special about blue dream.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has like, it's unmistakable blue
dream with the, with the structure of a
[SPEAKER_05]: gelato or these lemon cherries,
you know, and so I love being able to kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of sneak that in under the rug where
people were like, Whoa, that's fricking
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're haters of blue dream,
you know, and I love blue dream for its
[SPEAKER_05]: own, you know, in its own right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dream is one of the best plants out
there as far as structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the apical of structure and yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a, you know, resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not have the effects that
everybody's looking for, but it sure is
[SPEAKER_05]: special in its own right for the soccer
moms, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ideal for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for people that aren't looking for
that, like kick you in the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, you want, you want a turned
up version of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very much like that, but it's like
the turned up version of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell me how you got your start in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: How long has it been?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I started growing, you know,
in the industry, I guess there wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really an industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was a kid, like selling sacks and
all that, but like, when I came to Eugene
[SPEAKER_04]: in 90s and at 96, I had really bad
allergies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was growing all these different
pepper plants, you know, habanero,
[SPEAKER_04]: that too, like all, and just like
basically just eating them raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cause I was like, man,
this allergies isn't like on another
[SPEAKER_04]: level.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they call it the, what is the
valley of sickness or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: the land valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I just, I popped a couple,
you know, obviously I was smoking weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: I come in, I was working with a friend
that was like connected to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think still one of the last holders of
the Trinity because I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave it back to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been looking for it forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trinity Bob was supposed to give me a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you know Bob from,
from up there in Eugene Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob Dole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it fancy cars?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this guy's super pierced up,
um, tatted up guy, different, but he's
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, he goes by Bob Dole,
but he's the one that like his,
[SPEAKER_04]: his name's Andrew.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when he, when I first got in contact
with Trinity, it was from him in 97.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but anyway, I gave, ended up giving
him the cut back and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, um, you know, becoming a part of this
friend group, you know, which is in Eugene
[SPEAKER_04]: in the nineties, there's like clicks,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a snog grass batch from
family clay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the dog kingdom clicks,
silver people and these other kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: crews.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then these kind of out of towners,
you know, they were coming there to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: My good buddies were from Wisco now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, goes, you know, Devin, Devin,
uh, Somerville, Kronkelstein.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's pretty, pretty, uh, popular kind of,
um, you know, does these kind of like old
[SPEAKER_04]: school Adam smasher chameleons and like,
like amazing dab rigs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I saw him make this little corn
cob pipe and I was like, Ooh, make me a
[SPEAKER_04]: three hole one on the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can do, you know, do full melt in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to call those Adam smasher.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they call them now,
but yeah, that's where they use the hot
[SPEAKER_04]: rod.
[SPEAKER_04]: You use the hot rod, you smash it in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is what, this is what I use to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, bong hits flowery, you know,
like I'll just put a nug in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: torches up red hot and bong hit like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a great way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got four, five of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got a, the actual downstem that
for the, for the bong for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three hole, remember the Eladelf one
where we put the old school hash in it,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like before all this new,
before all these new rigs and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: technology, you can't even barely handle
some of this hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like 90, you like full melt my
buddy, a buck, a new rose farms,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's, it's like, you look at
that stuff and it's like, how do you even
[SPEAKER_04]: like, it's hard to work with, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: In this stuff, you can't really hot knife
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, you can, but that's what the
beauty of this thing here is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you put a ball of that in here and then,
you know, you put that hot rod to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like as about as hot knife as
it gets, you know, and it's, it's really,
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it a lot, you know, and that's kind
of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so anyway, like I, um, I just put a
couple of seeds in a spider plant in my
[SPEAKER_04]: bedroom, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they sprouted and I was like,
Oh God, I build a spa for him,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then, you know, I had this foam and all
hanging in my closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like light leaks everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it was drunk, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like about as drunk as it gets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, well, I'm not going
to do it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I built a little box, you know,
I had like a 250 watt, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a light office, someone 's parking lot,
you know, and then I got 150 watt HPS from
[SPEAKER_04]: like a home Depot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's the little one had that
in this wood closet that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: box that I built and, you know,
I got blueberry trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Trinity Big Sur Holy and the strain
IDK.
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of Afghani it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you know, but, uh,
and with good genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went out and dug my soil out from a
King of States, uh, Apple orchard,
[SPEAKER_04]: just dug that, took it home, mixed it with
pith and perlite some, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: oyster shell, whatever green sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize at that time,
green sand takes so long to break down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even like, it's like,
uh, but I threw some green sand in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: some guanos and just watered and was
fucking sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like it was like so dank and so
bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics, genetics, the genetics,
you know, cause if you, cause really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with good genetics, if you don't
know over water or underwater overfeed or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you can underfeed good genetics,
you'll still be dank.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have good soil and good genetics,
you're halfway there, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the drawing in the kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole nother conversation,
but yeah, I mean, genetics, it's played
[SPEAKER_05]: such a huge role in the end product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's so, you know, discovering
that and then, you know, classic style
[SPEAKER_04]: just doubled every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I was a, you know,
remember, you remember Greg, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: from American ag up in Portland,
you know, like I was the first one to get
[SPEAKER_04]: him to get a carbon filter, you know,
like I went up there and he was 98 or 99.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember, but like, well,
my buddy that supposedly bred the
[SPEAKER_04]: Shishkeberry, um, Adam, he owned a,
um, a washing machine kind of repair
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we used his business to get the
wholesale account, you know, so we can get
[SPEAKER_04]: lights for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, cause they were building
their lights there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went up to Greg and I was like,
Hey man, I saw this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a like activated carbon air filter
for like exhaust.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all what I was like, yeah,
can you order me one?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, such a game changer,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, you grow in Trinity big,
sir, you know, like two bedrooms full,
[SPEAKER_04]: no filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just using the box fan with the
like attic fan on it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: making a box with the attic fan and the
vet, you know, the ducting out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that was your setup, you know,
to plug that into a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I remember one time I pulled,
I pulled up to my house, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: getting ready to turn in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell the trend, you know,
just like on the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right when I was about to turn in four
sheriffs, just right in front of my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they went two blocks,
two houses down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stopped and then they drove two
houses down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled in and they were like,
getting the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, Oh my God, bugging bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were such a game changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I mean, I remember growing some chem
back in the day and, and it just,
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole house smelled, but even the
neighbors down the street were like,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a, have you guys seen the skunk?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought they were fucking with me,
but they really thought it was a skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally thought it was a skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it was so strong for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it smells so much like a live skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially a lot of stuff we had back in
the day compared to Trinity even,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I mean, to be honest,
I haven't smelled anything more skunky
[SPEAKER_04]: than that, than the original Royal trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Trinity cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's the future trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, we had the Trinity and
then this other Trinity came like after we
[SPEAKER_04]: called it the future trend, a little more
dense, a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the one going around right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the old school one.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of things that are like that
where they're like the Durban's another
[SPEAKER_05]: one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's a different Durban than I
remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Durban wasn't a turpentine dominant,
you know, aroma on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, it was cherries and it was
funky and you know, anise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like licorice cherries and
strong and pungent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the stuff now that I see is
Durban is super hazy, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's very, very hazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, and that wasn't the Durban that I
remember.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Durban we had was like orange,
like orange yarn hair growing over that
[SPEAKER_05]: would cover, like it didn't look like it
had trichomes on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she pulled the hairs back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so many things were like that,
but yeah, that Trinity extremely,
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely special.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like finding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you have one person I know has
it, but you know, obviously getting old
[SPEAKER_04]: school genetics from old school types of
people, it's a, it's a process in itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a reason they're not out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably a good reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of stuff, you know,
you know, I have things that I won't let
[SPEAKER_04]: go, you know, like Graham, you know,
he gave me the PHK and I did some breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: with it, but I won't let that cut go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't same with Brandon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave me the Afghani bull rider.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, you know, it's well, I think we're
stewards of these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our job to protect them, not just to
keep them alive and share them with
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody, which a lot of people think,
Oh yeah, you should share them with
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, as a steward, you should be
responsible with them for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, I mean, just like everything,
you know, we see what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and the stewardship that is
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that isn't, that could be,
you know, there's a, there's a big thing
[SPEAKER_04]: that's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's more that could happen,
especially with notoriety and publicity.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are getting, if they were
to, you know, utilize that and really turn
[SPEAKER_04]: it instead of for financial gain and still
keep the financial gain part, but really
[SPEAKER_04]: do it for philanthropic reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stewarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever their, even their
perspective of relationship is with the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, but if they stewarded that for
others, you know, instead of it being more
[SPEAKER_04]: superficial and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, once it's authentic,
it's just, and the thing is all these
[SPEAKER_05]: things they come across as either
authentic or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, you can see right through all the
bullshit a lot of times, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the plant helps with that
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it sure does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shed the veil and cut the veil and,
you know, really in our own self and our
[SPEAKER_04]: own behavior and mental dispositions and
in the outside world too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I was so excited at Terp
Nami this last weekend because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: quality level of breeders that were there
all in one place, a lot of Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_05]: people, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But more Sativa leaning hybrids or Sativas
that I'd ever seen in one place at one
[SPEAKER_05]: time that outnumbered the gelatos and
outnumbered the cookie crosses and the
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff that we've really seen as modern
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, you know, the P there was a lot of
people from the Hills coming down,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were seeing these long flowering
varieties and in abundance from all over
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesse from Bio Vortex.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Mark from Grey Shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we had, you know, Jackson was there,
Mean Gene and Rebel Grown and,
[SPEAKER_05]: and a bunch of people coming together with
all these old school genetics and old
[SPEAKER_05]: school expressions, stuff that,
you know, maybe it's a new cross,
[SPEAKER_05]: but a lot of stuff I've seen before,
you know, 15 years ago, 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: that gets me excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gives me hope for the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I feel like that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: When there's all these great people,
we got a group photo of everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Short was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, and then we had Ariane from
Greenhouse coming out and he was like
[SPEAKER_05]: shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what are these Americans doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen this happen before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, so that gives me hope
that we can get ourselves out of this
[SPEAKER_05]: bottleneck where it's all gelatos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like there's nothing wrong with
gelatos.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with these purple
candy gas varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's more to cannabis than just
those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more than Instagram, you know,
there's nothing wrong with Instagram and
[SPEAKER_05]: it can be used as a positive tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it has its benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has benefits for both of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think it helps us promote our
brands, but at the same time, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: get to smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get to taste it and you don't
get to feel the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I think that's what's,
um, really it's education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what a lot of us that
have been around a while should be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just my personal opinion is informing
everyone, you know, cause if, if I have,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a few different cookie crosses,
a few different gelato things,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, you know, others say,
oh geez, or hazes or cams, and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: continually going over to these hazes and
cams and oh geez, you know, people should
[SPEAKER_04]: take note of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we have the, we can do, you know,
we have the best of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you have the best of both,
you're going to choose what registers in
[SPEAKER_04]: your own chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I think once people understand
that they should actually maybe not seek
[SPEAKER_04]: out what's hype and hyping, but seek out
what's, you know, the who's growing it,
[SPEAKER_04]: how it's grown methodology and how old the
genetic line is maybe, and try to discover
[SPEAKER_04]: something new because you might realize
that, Hey, this older stuff really vibes
[SPEAKER_04]: with me more actually, because the hives
may be more stimulating, more
[SPEAKER_04]: invigorating, more, you know, like
cerebral and you know, more rushy and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, these kinds of feelings are like,
kind of what the, you know, the old
[SPEAKER_04]: schoolers are liking and have been liking
for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence why, you know, the turpnami,
you see this, you know, everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've been doing, you know,
like, yeah, no, same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all been doing for a long time,
but it's not hype bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's creativity and effect expressed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the modern world has changed things
so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like back in the day,
you used to know where your vegetables
[SPEAKER_05]: were coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: You used to know who was raising your
cattle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And same thing with breeding your flowers
or growing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, there's a big disconnect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm, I have some of my Snoop
Dogg selling some of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just saw jars with the loud loops on
there, but there's this big disconnect and
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're not given necessarily the
breeder's credit or the cultivator's
[SPEAKER_05]: credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just marketing flower and it is
what it is, but I feel like there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: better story and a deeper story and
there's deeper understanding to be had
[SPEAKER_05]: about all this stuff, especially like
farmers up in Humboldt, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I use them as the example,
but it's really farmers everywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to tell their story,
farm to table where you can go to the
[SPEAKER_05]: farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see them produce it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can talk to the grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can talk to the breeder, the extract
artist, whoever that is where,
[SPEAKER_05]: where there's like more of a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have a deeper connection to
that flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, cannabis is about community
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like that's part that we've
kind of gone away from that we really need
[SPEAKER_05]: to go back to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what's, I think that's
what's coming back around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's why obviously these
podcasts are so popular for people and
[SPEAKER_04]: cause you have, you know, a lot of really
cool people and expressions of humanity on
[SPEAKER_04]: these different podcasts that are,
you know, being able to connect with a
[SPEAKER_04]: different set of, you know, viewers and a
whole different sphere and to be able to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, this gets really, you know,
enlightening for everyone and really
[SPEAKER_04]: endearing for all of us to be,
you know, be able to share what we've
[SPEAKER_04]: experienced, the fight, the struggles that
we've, you know, cause as you,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's been a smaller time that
it's been legal of us doing this than it's
[SPEAKER_04]: been illegal of us doing this,
you know, and, and a lot of us,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we did a lot of work for the
States and different things, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I did a lot of work with Oregon
and their legalization push and multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: rules, advisory committees, head grower,
advisor got things like unlimited plan
[SPEAKER_04]: count written into law, you know,
when it was like a hundred plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, federal, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 99 and under no, no call to the fed a
hundred and over, they could call the fed
[SPEAKER_04]: 101, you know, you're like, you're like
bombing, you know, so like, to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: get things like unlimited plan count
written in and, you know, like really
[SPEAKER_04]: holding that seat for the people really as
a people's voice, you know, cause even at
[SPEAKER_04]: the end, right at the very end,
when that got signed into law,
[SPEAKER_04]: that got switched up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's even in when it's
public, even lobbying makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have short memories.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like people have short memories.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's new people coming online all the
time that they weren't there to experience
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's great to be able to remind people
or the younger generations that are coming
[SPEAKER_05]: online.
[SPEAKER_05]: To be able to watch this now or watch this
podcast that we're having five years from
[SPEAKER_05]: now at 50 years from now, a hundred years
from now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, understand what was going
on in 2024.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a different thing in
2030, even in, you know, this next five
[SPEAKER_04]: years, the next 10 years is going to be
crazy for cannabis, you know, who knows
[SPEAKER_04]: what's going to happen, but it's not going
to be less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be less and it's going
global.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's already, you know, you remember
how it was when it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what Colorado, you know, Washington,
Oregon, Oregon, Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, and then it Cali,
then it just like, it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, now look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's international scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Germany, which is a very big
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a very big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of people are like,
Oh, it's just another country.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's a big, big, big country.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going online with recreation
connected to all the EU.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have the highest, the German EU
GMP is, is the highest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of its standards as far as like German GMP
standards are higher than anywhere else in
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, we had Arian talking about
it, about how, you know, the stacks of
[SPEAKER_05]: paperwork to get the CGMP, uh,
done is like, you know, four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, real pro stuff, you know,
hard to bootstrap, hard to, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: very hard to bootstrap, very hard to go
from the ground up, you know, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm big on, on testing oversight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we need more of that in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not super big on government oversight
and more government, but I am in favor of
[SPEAKER_05]: universal testing that, that's,
uh, puts us in line with other countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, I feel like there's so much
motivation to have higher testing results
[SPEAKER_05]: for the farmer, for the breeder,
for the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the person who suffers is the end
user, cause they're not getting true
[SPEAKER_05]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's the thing is it's like,
you know, when we are getting true
[SPEAKER_04]: results, it's harder to sell, you know,
like even, you know, like our good
[SPEAKER_04]: buddies, SC labs, you know, and,
um, like they, I've been known them for a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time and he's been helping me through
that whole process with Oregon and to see
[SPEAKER_04]: how, you know, what we're getting testing
wise with him consistently for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use SC as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like they're straight shooters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're real, you know, but then
when you're getting a 22 or 19 or 23,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 23 maybe is more marketable,
but when you're getting the 19 to 21
[SPEAKER_04]: range, it's so much harder to market that
flower in the rec reality because people
[SPEAKER_04]: think that it's more, it's supposed to be
around 30 and that's not, that's actually
[SPEAKER_04]: not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's when, you know,
what I talked to them, even Addison,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like, um, when I, you know,
it's steep hill back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I first brought him the golden at
that time, you know, he tested it at 24.7,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, and the highest that he had
tested at that point was 19 for something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a huge deal to jump that much,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but even then he was talking about it
when they started doing these hash testing
[SPEAKER_04]: and different things and flower testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have it that high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like actually physically
possible, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, to have these like 40%,
it's like, ah, it's pretty sus,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it is, you know, I have some
testing results that are like 40% total
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid, 40, 41% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think of that amount, if we look at
a bud, like 40% of that is cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it's wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I want to believe it, you know,
I have a, I have a lot of really good
[SPEAKER_04]: tests and a lot of good COAs that are
really, you know, you can show them off,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I don't have anything for Steve Hill
that tests in the forties.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, um, you know, like in Oregon,
there's some labs that get some high
[SPEAKER_04]: testing and, you know, SC labs have always
been, you know, like true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most, cause most of the gear that I'm
selecting naturally tests between 22 and
[SPEAKER_04]: 26%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just what my kind of, you know,
bioassay, what, what that's kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, desiring is that range just
naturally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best flavors come in that low
twenties, you know, and there's some stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's anomalies that, you know,
that I think are in thirties that do have
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing flavor in their high terpenes,
but it's very rare because cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: compete with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So typically the higher the cannabinoids,
the lower the terpenes and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and then it's not all about just
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, now the word flavorances come to mind,
uh, recently abstracts tech did some
[SPEAKER_05]: white, they wrote some white papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: On flavor incident, you know, sulfur based
compounds and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thiles, basically, you know, we've been
talking about files for a long time and
[SPEAKER_05]: now they're categorizing tiles and showing
how they contribute to the flavor and
[SPEAKER_05]: aroma, which I think is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, those are all kind of the more like,
I mean, is it like a micro thile or thile?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a, it's a, it's a, you know,
basically, uh, it's a style of terpene
[SPEAKER_04]: still.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a smaller flavor molecule.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot harder to test for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's why I think that like,
you know, for me personally, like I like
[SPEAKER_04]: fresher, you know, after it's been dried
for about seven days, from that point to
[SPEAKER_04]: about a month is my favorite sweet spot
personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I'm assuming it's because all the,
you know, terpenes and the micro thiles
[SPEAKER_04]: and the thiles are all in a combination
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the more, um, you know,
ones that degenerate, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: quicker, they're not going to be around in
a, in a, in a month, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: or, you know, people like, Oh,
curing it slow and low, this, that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the other, you know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me personally, I just,
I just like the range of what happens from
[SPEAKER_04]: when it's freshly dried.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it loud.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to, to, to, to, you know,
and it's like, even my buddy Steve,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like, um, from green life,
he, he's like, man, like, what's the deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I want my jar to fucking
smack, you know, I want it to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I'm like, man, he's all,
when I open your jar just hits,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I'm like, man, cause I love
fresh weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's, it's also subjective
to the cultivar and there's, there's
[SPEAKER_05]: factors at play, but like Skittles,
for example, it is the best when it's
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's done drying and it's like maybe
cured for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to burp it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when it is the very best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't get better on the nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still smokes good for a lot longer,
but that first like week and a half,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just hits you in the face.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's sours kind of like that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the sour all smoke good for a long
time, but like the real, the loudness of
[SPEAKER_05]: the sour, when you open it, the fresher,
the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like, even with like OGs,
you know, it's like after a week is when
[SPEAKER_04]: they really start to punch harder,
you know, like, you know, you're like
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to smoke it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it has its thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after a week, it's like, yeah,
the anise and the whole like thing starts
[SPEAKER_04]: to come out more.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like more piney and earthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's like Jack's, Jack's have
their own thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jack's, I feel like the limonene stuff
that's really high in limonene actually
[SPEAKER_05]: deteriorates pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't last even in like the
turplocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a bunch of trials with stuff and
some of that limonene, the limonene
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties seem to age faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure exactly why, but it's
definitely one of those things like six
[SPEAKER_05]: months later, they're, they're never as
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe because that terpene,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I mean, it's a solvent and a
lot of, you know, industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that's kind of degrading the
other terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: The use of that solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it works really good on those
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's your favorite thing to smoke?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been liking this SPSC by 89 NL.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some things in that jar pack
that I really like a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one's just the 89 NL.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked the high, what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it kind of reminds me of like a
dog walker smell almost a little bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are, you know, I liked that one a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lemon punch by 89.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been liking a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: PHK Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of just, you know,
like I said, I have a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty good selection of things to choose
from, but I keep going to these specific
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, some of them are new,
but like the hazy Kush, it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenaline, awesomene, humaline kind of
strain, but it'll always have a place for
[SPEAKER_04]: me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people are like, oh,
I'm not really into the terpenaline at
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: The right combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit smells like candy and it's like
really good, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's done right, it's epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the high that's, you know,
when those terpenes are combined with high
[SPEAKER_04]: THC, it's something special happens,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same with all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the reason people understand the
reason a lot of they like something,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not the cannabinoids, it's fucking
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that combination, you know,
when you have all these cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_04]: we do understand and ones we don't,
you combine that with terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: we do understand and ones we don't,
you know, there's just a range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you start talking of like
organics versus conventionals and all the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, enzymatic stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when you really,
there's a micro nuances that we just don't
[SPEAKER_04]: understand yet that, you know,
that for some reason it's a calling us,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we just don't know why scientifically
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're just scratching the surface of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I would a hundred percent agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love soil and I use cocoa,
but I also love smoking soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have a closed loop facility,
so I'm not trying to bring bugs in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole giant biome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, in a perfect world,
yeah, we could do that, but here we're
[SPEAKER_05]: confined to the constraints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of cleanliness, especially in trying to
be, yeah, as sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the cleaner spots I've been to
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like really, and the protocol's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our SOPs are pretty dialed and we're just
constantly trying to prevent pests,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, cause pests can come in from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can come in from the shirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't allow people typically in our
nursery ever, you know, we have a pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: dense plant count in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this stuff got me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells amazing though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the, from the, from the non-smoke
stirp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, you're like, cause you
remember you were saying the cams like get
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allergic to this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I get a question for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organ.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about a genetic that everyone
hates talking about in Oregon is Yeager.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your opinion on Yeager?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a phenome like the Hindu is
from what I've understood, even like you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, um, you look at Graham's purple
Hindu Kush, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it smells like tangerine and citrus purple
cracked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like cookies kind of like,
um, and you know, he told me, he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: dude, I, I sourced this out of Hindu Kush
seeds, you know, and just so I'm assuming
[SPEAKER_04]: the Yeager's same deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a purple Hindu Kush, meaning a Hindu
Kush that was purple and it made it
[SPEAKER_04]: through, you know, people love it and
it's, you know, resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like run its course through
the outdoor community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like blue dream in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone loved it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally it's another blue dream
where it was like in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was like, Whoa, what is this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cuts got out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of like the stewardship of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, you know, we keep going back to
the stewardship, but that's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it became popular and then
people started hating on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, it's a unique smelling plant
and the highest, you know, is what it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think there's just a lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, anything, um, that people
blast out that hard, it's going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: some kickback.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
Eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people hate on cookies now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cookies in the back in the day,
the real original cookies was special.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it from Alec actually from ST Labs
in 2011 or 2012.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have it when it was just cookies?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was only cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Small producer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, so the original, it was more like
burnt rubber, funk, like extremely strong
[SPEAKER_04]: licorice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one I'm still rocking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I believe that it's a lot of
people, some people question the fact that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's Durban in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've totally firmly believe that that
Anise, that licorice comes from Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unmistakably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the Durban we had had that same
licorice in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend, Josh Freeman, he's the one who
brought down seeds of Durban from Canada
[SPEAKER_05]: that he'd gotten up there with my other
friend, Joe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the Anise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like first time I smelled
cookies, I was like, Whoa, that reminds me
[SPEAKER_05]: of the Durban.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing you know, they're saying,
Oh, it's Durban in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that it's probably Durban in there
that gives it that Anise.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the, we got the original cookies we
got wasn't the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't the thin minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just the cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy, Polly had gotten it from $5,000
for the cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd gotten it from the hydro shop that
was in Berkeley, I believe on fourth
[SPEAKER_05]: street, right by the, I think there's a
pet shop that sold lizards and stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, there was a guy that sold it
to him and then he got it for our group
[SPEAKER_05]: and we shared it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was this crazy cookies that was
really small producing, but it reminded me
[SPEAKER_05]: of OG in the sense that the node spacing
was terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you didn't support it up,
it would just spaghetti over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, and it was so strong,
you know, and half a pound of light was
[SPEAKER_05]: what we were getting yield wise,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I still grew it for half a pound of light
when we were all, you know, we had other
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff at the time that would yield a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I liked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made some, made some things out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, it was, you know, I still have
that cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I'm still holding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a special one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously made it this far.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just the branding that made it
this far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it made it into everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the new shit has cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally all the stuff that we're
smoking now that has purple, there's
[SPEAKER_05]: cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as much as people want to hate on
stuff, it's like, they hate on stuff for
[SPEAKER_05]: the wrong reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that gets me right now is
purple weed is so popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I feel like, when I'm phenohunting
the expressions that are louder in the
[SPEAKER_05]: same progeny, we'll have green and purple
and different hues, but the more green it
[SPEAKER_05]: is, the usually louder they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people want what they can't have.
[SPEAKER_05]: They always want the anomalies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we value stuff that's not
necessarily important and part of that
[SPEAKER_05]: social media, but totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you find that the, you know,
green versus purple in the hashing and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that you're like, you know,
more, there would be more hash potentials
[SPEAKER_04]: and purples or more hash potentials and
greens, you know, cause I've, I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing a lot of the, at least a lot of the
greener stuff that I work with is pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: greasy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you know, like the OGs and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sours and OGs are super greasy with
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the, you know, the SPSC 89,
my buddy Buck, he, he made some amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: rosin out of an amazing hash, full melts
and everything, but the yields weren't
[SPEAKER_04]: like as, you know, as much, but versus
like, say if you're doing some,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, more animal mints or something
like that, that's just like, like an all
[SPEAKER_04]: trichomes and a little more, you know,
waxy, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then there's the GMOs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just dump and dump and dump,
you know, and that's a turp that I can get
[SPEAKER_05]: sick of that I really like, but I can get
sick of it pretty, cause it's just so,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's so strong and it's good, but like
they put it in everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I like the original GMOs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like Chem D to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the, it's like, I feel like
it's not as loud as GMO, but it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get that smell and it reminds me of the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I got some in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, really the AJ sour
diesel reminds me of GMO a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed with OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has that kind of little more rank.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sour D cut that's going around
now more than anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the sour D that's more citrusy,
that's bright.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really loud in the bag with its
complexity is the one that I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I, when I got this AJ sour D from a
crazy composer, Dave, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I, I was like, bro, is, I was like,
is this normally just like GMO smelling
[SPEAKER_04]: like OG GMO smelling.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all, oh yeah, that's this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, that's not the one that
was going out here forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I believe that sour is a bag seed from
Kevin 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of different theories on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's different stories about
who bred it and you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're in my book if people want to read
it, but, uh, just from what I've seen with
[SPEAKER_05]: the dog, but that we had with the sours
that I've grown and similarly,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the lab results that I've seen in
fingerprinting and, you know, we were
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about homozygosity earlier and you
know, you look at the S ones, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: as being typically more homozygous and you
can look at chem dog and then you can look
[SPEAKER_05]: at these other and, and how it pans out on
paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, you know, and there are a lot of
these are very similar in homozygosity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, well, there's a good chance in my
opinion that it's just an S one and a
[SPEAKER_05]: really special S one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some of the best things are bag
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, and, and single bag seeds,
not like you accidentally pollinated
[SPEAKER_04]: something, but when you just find a couple
seeds, those are the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are, those are my favorite too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still have collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I think the real smokers are
the ones that find the real bag seeds and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's where the real magic is at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, and I mean,
I'm, I'm kind of esoteric with this whole
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe that's just the plan offering
certain people that the jewel,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, offering them something that
they're going to steward properly,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, getting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, here's your offering for
being such a devoted, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about devotion, I think that's
really the direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: This industry is the people that are
thriving.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the old school people,
especially because they're devotional,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're devoted to this play stewards.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can talk about stewards, but as far as
a devotion, like whether you're a
[SPEAKER_05]: musician, you're devoted to music or
whether you're devoted to this plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: when it becomes devotional, where you
wouldn't do this no matter what happens,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's illegal, legal, where there's
money or no money, that's when the special
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I'm sure we've all experienced
it over the last little bit of years,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, of like, you know, different
kinds of things going which way or another
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, kind of some fears or
whatever kind of come into play and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, really it's like, fuck man,
there ain't nothing else to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, except work with this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm in there for the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in there for the rest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and it's funny because once
mushrooms got more popular, they kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: went mainstream about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: People were like, dude, you should start
breeding mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is 2018 and people were
like, dude, you should start breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: mushrooms too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you like breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why aren't you breeding mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had some friends that were
getting some spots, 30,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_05]: warehouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I've already went through
this with cannabis, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to start over, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like this is my life's calling and
I love cooking and I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the two main things I have in my
life that I feel like I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that I've devoted my whole life
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then taking on mushrooms, I enjoy
mushrooms as a spectator.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from the outside, I love
mushrooms and I love plant medicine and I
[SPEAKER_05]: think it's so special.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as like what I'm going to
devote my time to, and my energy,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is where it's going to end up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love being part of the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just love the community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a really special community
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's so, you know, for myself,
I kind of feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, as you do with the cooking and
the herb, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: these are really tangible things that we
can entangle our intentions into like
[SPEAKER_04]: actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, just look at,
you know, our grandmothers or mothers or
[SPEAKER_04]: fathers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, even with Master Oomoto
with, you know, hidden messages of water
[SPEAKER_04]: and all these kinds of words, you know,
that old book, A Secret Life of Plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, this is like, this is some
esoteric information that we all
[SPEAKER_04]: understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning like when someone really loves us
and we consume something from that person,
[SPEAKER_04]: shit's noticeable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and we feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you don't, then,
you know, you should be more aware because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like really obvious in a lot of ways,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this plant and cooking is
something that really is we can,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it acts as a server of that
intention and love and compassion that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can, that we're sharing ourselves,
you know, and our entanglement of
[SPEAKER_04]: something with this very special thing,
whether it be food or the sacred wisdom
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, you know, it's, you know,
we're very lucky to be able to even be
[SPEAKER_04]: conversing about this really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you're able to share that
energy with somebody else and they get it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just so much better too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, and there's a whole community of
people that get it, which is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of them in Oregon, you know,
I'm originally from Oregon originally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of good friends from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of great people in our industry are
either transplants that live there now or
[SPEAKER_05]: have lived there in their past.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something special about Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it has one of the best
climates in the world, but it's also the
[SPEAKER_05]: mindset of the people that live in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the water, you know, we got really
good clean water up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: With lithium in it in some places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mindset, you know, obviously with
the Oregon country fair and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the kind of Eugene community of what
was created there and that kind of spread
[SPEAKER_05]: through and grateful debt influence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love California too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I'm here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the West coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Seattle, but there's definitely
something special about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Portland all the way down to Ashland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, when we talk about
stewardship of genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, it was happening there and it
was happening long before I started
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I'm growing in end of 96,
97, you know, and people have been doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it for decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to that, and like, you know,
some really global reputable breeders
[SPEAKER_04]: coming through there, picking up genetics,
taking them back to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe and doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I just feel like I got
blessed with synchronicity really,
[SPEAKER_04]: and just kind of had my ears open and mind
open at the right times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And luckily, you know, with that community
and bringing the right people together to
[SPEAKER_04]: where you can glean what you can and
obviously work with this plan ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, I was, when I moved to
Eugene, I was kind of, kind of a violent
[SPEAKER_04]: guy, you know, I got a lot of fist fights,
half Korean, half white moved around every
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of, you know, didn't like bullies
and kind of, you know, when you come to
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene, it's like, it was, you know,
we're doing a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're growing and, you know, doing a lot
of hustling and pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get kind of rowdy and you take
someone for a hundred bucks or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you get kind of this thing
and that community really helped with the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of nullify a lot of that,
you know, by go this direction,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't go that direction, you know,
in the whole atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: The communities like that, you know,
if you're being a punk, it's not as cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're being, you know,
altruistically minded or at least not
[SPEAKER_04]: harming others, that's more cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that Oregon community is
really, um, I like that about Oregon for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially about Eugene and Eugene has
its own vibe too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, each, each community, whether
it's, you know, Medford, Eugene,
[SPEAKER_05]: Portland, you know, the coast,
you know, there's, there's places on the
[SPEAKER_05]: coast that are amazing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have their own energy and vibe,
but there's something special about
[SPEAKER_05]: Eugene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the food scene in Eugene is kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that special?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: My buddy owns this place called party
downtown and it's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he started a little food truck by friendly
street market.
[SPEAKER_04]: My other, you know, um, friend's lady owns
a friendly street market and it just
[SPEAKER_04]: basically like all these kinds of hip
younger, you know, our age kind of grew up
[SPEAKER_04]: there or been there a lot, wanted to bring
the goodness there and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there it proliferates, you know,
people accept it and support it when it's
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cause you know, Oregon has a weird,
um, snobbiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and like a snobbish kind of beer and,
and food trucks for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, look at Portlandia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They made a whole movie about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole like TV show about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that shit's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, you know, the Will Ferrell with
the chicken farm thing or whatever it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the vibe in a lot of ways
there because people are so, if it isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect and it isn't tasty and it isn't
heady and it isn't like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even like, you know, late nineties,
early two thousands there, if you come,
[SPEAKER_04]: if your weed wasn't at a certain level,
it's no sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pulling it out, you know, cause it's
going to be obvious that you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you're not going to get like
shunned, but you might, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might, you know, all these,
like the glass culture and the,
[SPEAKER_04]: that, that nature when people are,
you know, the finest of the fine organics,
[SPEAKER_05]: no Chinese glass up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was years before Chinese glass
actually made it in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, shoot, man, it's like really,
uh, it was a unique scene there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and really, really special scene
with all the, you know, snog grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Family like the four 20 parties where all
the kids come and before they'd go out on
[SPEAKER_04]: tour and, you know, for the, for the
summer, for all the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: jam band shows and all the good stuff,
man, all the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Grateful Dead influence,
I mean, on our whole community is so
[SPEAKER_05]: profound and so big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, it's a, it's a positive impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, some things in the
industry, there's negative impact from big
[SPEAKER_05]: business and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some positive, but mostly bad,
but Grateful Dead, it was only positive
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, on the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And within the community and the Grateful
Dead community, which they're slightly
[SPEAKER_05]: different, but they're also completely
tied in with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, rainbow family, Grateful Dead,
all these things in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: community, it's all tied in together
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their own niches and their own
clicks, but everybody's kind of tied in
[SPEAKER_05]: together because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, even like you see from the Bay
area to Eugene with the like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Keezy, pranksters, dead, all this kind of
stuff and all the, you know, even the
[SPEAKER_04]: Shulgin family and that, you know,
that kind of rest in peace.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sasha Shulgin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then even Nick Sands, I was at a party
with Sasha and Ann and Nick Sands and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, all the doctors from John
Hopkins university when they're working on
[SPEAKER_04]: the mycology stuff, this is like 20 years
ago, you know, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know actually, I was like the
weed guy, you know, and I didn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: know, I knew, but I didn't know,
you know, when Nick started telling us
[SPEAKER_04]: stories about making a hundred grams of
orange sunshine a day and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and the kind of, you know,
he told us this one story about breaking
[SPEAKER_04]: down the lab, throwing it all in the van,
driving it across town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's getting chased by the cops,
you know, he gets the safe house and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just like, he was just tripping,
you know, cause you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sasha Shulgin was one of my neighbors.
[SPEAKER_05]: He lived in between Pleasant, he lives in
Lafayette, but between like Walnut Creek,
[SPEAKER_05]: Pleasant Hill, and then it goes over the
hill into Lafayette and he lived up at the
[SPEAKER_05]: top of there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, good, good energy all over that
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was crazy to like be at that
party and to hear, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and to see those John Hopkins
University, my college is sort of the ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that pushed this whole thing, you know,
now years later, you know, cause they
[SPEAKER_04]: slept it for a while because obviously the
government and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to hear, you know, Sasha telling the
stories of, you know, and then he had like
[SPEAKER_04]: the retired head of the Western division
forensics of the DEA was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a like interesting party.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, you know, only 50 of us up in like
near the Bohemian Grove.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of like a, you know,
it's like, did this really happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like really?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, we're there and you know,
we had all the different molecules there
[SPEAKER_04]: and him telling all about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like just the, you know, him and his
two best friends, you know, were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, these, these, these people
were in their like late seventies look
[SPEAKER_04]: like eighties, you know, maybe in the end
they were with it and to be the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Sasha is quite the legend
because it wasn't like he like people,
[SPEAKER_04]: he tested it all on himself, you know,
like if he got high before he got sick,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that good direction to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's some like, oh gee bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also he believed in it that much.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a devotional in the same way we're
devotional for cannabis, his impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it profound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, imagine the amount of,
um, good feelings that he's brought to
[SPEAKER_04]: fruition in the world and the continuum
of, you know, just those couple things and
[SPEAKER_04]: the derivatives of those things even.
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I feel like we're in
evolution of the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: To a degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he, there's an evolution of him.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's prevalent around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's for sure that he had
impact on it and still has impact on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's amazing when we can
pass on that energy, whether it's via
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis or cannabis seeds or genetics or
whatever it is that you're even molecular
[SPEAKER_05]: structures, you know, molecular
structures, music, whatever it is that you
[SPEAKER_05]: do that you love where you can contribute
that part.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's what life is all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at the end of the day,
it's like finding out what you're good at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing that to the best of your ability so
that you're passing on something in the
[SPEAKER_05]: form of an energy to everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a wisdom energy based in altruism,
you know, and really to be able to share
[SPEAKER_04]: that is, I mean, you know, as you just
said, it's like our, a lot of us is life
[SPEAKER_04]: goal here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you can actually come to fruition
with that, the happiness that is
[SPEAKER_04]: experienced as something quite special and
unique, you know, something you can't buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even it's not in the same realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you know, even with
marketing and advertising, some of this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, you know, you can buy advertising,
but some of the stuff you can't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in the history and the time and
the people's commitment and devotion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you say, it's like, that's an
unbought thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that happens
spontaneously, organically and naturally
[SPEAKER_04]: in the human mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like, that's one of our special
traits here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And happiness is such an interesting thing
because I think happiness comes from
[SPEAKER_05]: devotion a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think happiness, a lot of people are
like, well, I don't want to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy if I didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like, I'm the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that work is what makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being able to do what I do every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm super happy that I'm able to do that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hard work keeps us out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard work, hard work is so, you know,
I think hard work is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I think when we're committed
to one thing and devotional, we can,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, almost with blinders on,
that's when you can find real happiness on
[SPEAKER_05]: a different level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then work doesn't seem so tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still work and you know, we're
getting older.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like our bodies get more beat up every
year a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, as far as like happiness is
very subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, like really if that was
most of our focuses and what we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: was based in that kind of momentum of,
you know, happiness, altruism,
[SPEAKER_04]: compassion, love, these kinds of things
that would really like as a society,
[SPEAKER_04]: as a community, as a people's,
if we focus on that, generate more of that
[SPEAKER_04]: and just do what we love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I think the, you know,
the ripple effects of that, it's like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: world changing, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we're actually seeing
that in real time because all of us and
[SPEAKER_04]: even the generations before us,
because we're kind of in that weird
[SPEAKER_04]: interim generation of cannabis,
it seems like, because there's the ones in
[SPEAKER_04]: their, you know, 60s, 70s, 80s past and
then us in our 40s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, the sets below us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we really, it's really
something's quite special that we got to
[SPEAKER_04]: take this torch on, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really, I remember like when
Michael Baucus, Morpheus, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he had a doctor chemist, Mark,
and they wanted me and Mark to get
[SPEAKER_04]: together to run Montel's Greenhouse in DC,
that first big one, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, why does he, I said,
bro, why do you want me, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, I'm just like grow
boutique level organic flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, no, bro, we want you for your
intuitional ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to put you with Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a doctor chemist, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens there, then that's what
we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, ah, so then I took that
back home to Oregon, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, if they want me here,
then I'm going to take this back to Oregon
[SPEAKER_04]: and help the government, like with this
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's funny, we got the
Oregon Country Fair that would basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: Grateful Dead kind of was the band,
Hell's Angels was security back in the
[SPEAKER_04]: day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like what it is, you know,
a little more corporate, obviously,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like, you know, the Senator,
one of the backup managers there,
[SPEAKER_04]: a good friend, a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's how I got in contact
with the government system, because he's a
[SPEAKER_04]: Senator and he's basically the one of the
main champions of, he, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: was a champion for medical, got it to go
and champion for these kinds of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, next bills that win.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I went back and contacted him and
got in contact with him and kind of put me
[SPEAKER_04]: under his wing and had me help him how I
can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alec from SC Labs gave me all the
pesticide information to get every,
[SPEAKER_04]: the right things on the law, the rule
list, you know, like, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so a lot of people don't understand,
you know, we might be like a brand or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, us sitting here, they recognize
us maybe for seeds or genetics or high end
[SPEAKER_04]: organic flour or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reality is, is we're doing a lot
of work behind the scenes a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: times to really help this momentum happen
and continue to happen by getting proper
[SPEAKER_04]: laws put in place, getting proper
stewardship in the ways that at least the
[SPEAKER_04]: government can understand that,
you know, someone that smokes all day,
[SPEAKER_04]: every day can be accountable can be,
you know, eloquent, can be aware,
[SPEAKER_04]: intelligent, high IQ, these things happen
without any hindrance from this plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually add more expression of awareness
through the plant and they can,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and that's really helped,
I think, cause I saw where we consulted,
[SPEAKER_04]: we went and consulted US finance
committee, US Congress and DC,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's like multiple politicians
there and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, they wanted to hear from us
because we can speak awarely, we can do
[SPEAKER_04]: these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what we're doing with
the plant in a way that was out of their
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding at the time, you know,
in the, you know, 2012, 13, 14,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15, 16 now, now it's like, oh yeah,
they're like, oh yeah, all these smart
[SPEAKER_04]: people smoke weed, no big deal,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, you know, people were
kind of slow to get it, but this plant
[SPEAKER_05]: makes the world a better place,
you know, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and it's funny cause I think
even my parents' generation, they had a
[SPEAKER_05]: hard time with me wanting to be involved
with cannabis growing and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was pretty honest with my
parents, especially they'd come and visit
[SPEAKER_05]: us and stay at our house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we got plants in the garage and
my dad's like, oh yeah, you got plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I got plants in the garage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to let you know, I got plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, you have plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it's like, but it was kind
of a shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he was kind of disappointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was pretty impressed with the,
you know, our basic, our carpentry skills
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything else, but he was a little
bit worried about the legality of it and
[SPEAKER_05]: be getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Sanjay Goop, you know,
comes on 60 minutes and he changed the
[SPEAKER_05]: world in a whole different perspective,
showing kids that benefited from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and from cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's hard to argue that this
plant doesn't make the world a better
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm working in St. Vincent and
the Grenadines out and I work with the
[SPEAKER_05]: government down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I donated 30,000 seeds and I created a
strategy that should help infuse a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: money in the community if they do their
own breeding on the island and they have
[SPEAKER_05]: an identity for export.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the potential for that is
huge, but the government down there is
[SPEAKER_05]: very in support of using the plant to make
the world a better place and their
[SPEAKER_05]: community a better place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, I mean, that's really the,
in my opinion, the plants intention,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I know it's just a plant and
whatever, but you know, for us to have
[SPEAKER_04]: such a high receptor base for the
cannabinoid molecules and even like a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of our favorite animal, like the dog has
one of the largest cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_04]: systems and of all animals, you know,
for it to be our, you know, co-pilot and a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of this for a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, there's something
special about this plant that's on a deep
[SPEAKER_04]: level, you know, and that we're all seeing
it and sharing it and being a part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't hear anyone being like,
Oh no, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, unless, you know,
you have people who like to drink a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: booze seem like they have a kind of issue
with weed, you know, if they, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: alcoholics or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't like to smoke weed because
maybe it makes them drink less.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, no, that's a, it's like what
I always say with like alcohol,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's like, kind of like
cordyceps in a, in a Anne's brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like the alcoholism is
going to basically manipulate you and
[SPEAKER_04]: course you to doing its task.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and weed comes into the thing that's
going to make you drink less.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The weed is, you know, cause the alcohol
wants to be a part of it more,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so it's like, no, less alcohol,
no weed then, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've noticed that kind of cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean some people I've noticed some
people drink too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, they don't like to get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because oh, I have, my,
I get a weird trip, you know, weird head
[SPEAKER_04]: trip, you know, I'll get anxious or it's
like, yeah, man, you for sure will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think for sure if you smoke
first and then drink, you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: drink way less.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might get sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a drinker and then you just,
you know, occasional a smoke or you might
[SPEAKER_05]: get sick if you smoke too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like at the end you might get,
you might get the spins or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, you know, it's like, but I think it,
you definitely do.
[SPEAKER_05]: drink less when you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's just across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I do have friends that
crossfade a little too much, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we all have, we all have the, you know,
it's, uh, you know, like I, it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: like moderation is key with everything,
even with cannabis, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, cause you know, once our receptors are
full, they're full and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: how much more you need early, actually,
you don't need to waste it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can, you know, there's a,
there's a, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you get it when you're just
smoking hash, hash after hash and rosin
[SPEAKER_04]: and hash and hash at a certain point is
like, it's all flavor, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause it's, they ain't nothing much more
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going up any higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there are certain things,
uh, Durban poison being one of them in
[SPEAKER_05]: Malawi that don't have ceilings where you
can just keep smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go, you can go places you never
thought you could go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, this feels like LSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been there before or edibles,
you know, from some of the African
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wow, you, you just,
you do get a psychedelic experience and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's people that will argue it,
but I've been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know firsthand and I've done plenty
of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know in comparison, like I've had
more of a psychedelic experience with some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these varieties with edibles drinking
bang where they mix it with hot milk.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was what they're, you know,
a lot of the Buddhist practitioners way
[SPEAKER_04]: back, there's, you know, certain practices
where that that's in combination with the
[SPEAKER_04]: practice, you know, a little bit of bong,
you know, whole bottle, go into their
[SPEAKER_04]: retreat cave and, you know, do the,
I mean, you're like, Whoa, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a, you know, I've, I used to make
this back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we put just pack a crock pot
with sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just put olive oil in there and
do like a slow cook on it through the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just, you know, strike that
basically just pour that off and filter
[SPEAKER_04]: and just take spoonfuls, you know,
and like, you know, one teaspoon,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, you know, one tablespoon,
you know, like my buddy, one time my
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy's like, took like three tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He calls me the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear my heart stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was beating like one time every
couple minutes, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I've been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, back in the nineties, there wasn't a
ton of literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like one book on the chemistry
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we really liked exploring and trying
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had all this trim always,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would make tinctures and we would do
Bacardi 151 and put it on the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, double burner and cook it in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had different ways of making butter
and everything else, but we had so much
[SPEAKER_05]: extra trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always like, well, what can we do
with it now?
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was, you know, then we started
making bubble hash and that all changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, Oh, you know, we got extract
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's even making like the,
making the tinctures out of bubble hash or
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, the, you know,
the 220 or the whatever, the one sixties
[SPEAKER_04]: fluff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd like take all that and dry it and
make the tincture out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, that's like, what I'd like to do
is I'd like to heat the material just a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like when I make the tincture,
when I don't heat it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of does the fermentation thing and
starts to like expand shit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you de-carb it right from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You de-carb it when it's in flower form or
in hash form, and then put that to the
[SPEAKER_04]: extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like just a little easier to work
with, you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we always used to make different
stuff and different things for drinks and
[SPEAKER_05]: cocktails.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we never knew the milligrams back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just, you know, you, you would be
rushing off the first shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody knew off the first, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like sometimes even the first 15 minutes,
you know, some of the stuff, your face
[SPEAKER_03]: starts getting crunchy and hot or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, Oh, that was a little
stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only time that happens is when I eat
peppers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Peppers are strong, strong, strong
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love, I mean, that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to just carry around a bottle of
tincture because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: three, four drops under the tongue and
you're like, wow, you, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, like you're saying that,
you know, cause they, well, they do say
[SPEAKER_04]: that like a cannabinoids through the body,
through the stomach, through the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that kind of whole system is
going to create more of a psychedelic
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, you know, a certain range,
you know, and you, if you've eaten enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you've, you know, a hundred,
200, whatever milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like, it starts to happen,
you know, and I've told, I've worked with
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of people with cancer and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, obviously with tinctures
and stuff like that, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked to this one woman,
she had, I forgot what it's called.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some trans transgenital neuralgia
type of brain cancer that was on the optic
[SPEAKER_04]: nerve and brainstem, very severe pain one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's also termed it's suicide
disease because it's so bad, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I gave her the medicine and,
you know, and I told her, she's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, how much do I take?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was like, I was like as much
as you can, you know, and you're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: get to a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, you know, I'm kind of
scared, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, yeah, it's, it will be scary,
you know, but are you more scared of the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine or are you more scared of happens
if, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's crazy is she, she took the
medicine and at that dose and five weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: she called me frantic, you know,
heard this pop in her head, went to the
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor, got CAT scans, MRIs, and there was
just halos where those tumors were.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were size of one was the size of a,
um, like apricot, small apricot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one was the size of a ping pong
ball and gone, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and you know, like, and she told
me, she's like, the beginning was really
[SPEAKER_04]: hard because the amount, and when you're
having a terminal illness, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of other things psychologically going on
when you're at that level of being high
[SPEAKER_04]: and your fear of deaths and these things,
you know, like the very mortal things
[SPEAKER_04]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and she told me,
but then it kind of eased off and had this
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and you know, it's sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, uh, I don't know, maybe seven,
eight years ago and still watch her on
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook with her husband.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did, you know, coffee shop,
watched her daughter graduate college,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and like to be able to,
you know, we have lots of, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_04]: you do too, lots of, you know,
stories like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's no fucking better blessing than
that, you know, to be able to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to see that and to share that and to,
you know, share our experience of creating
[SPEAKER_04]: this medicine and a holistic way to where,
you know, where it does make the world a
[SPEAKER_04]: better place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of us, even an extra
day, one extra day longer, it's all worth
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if cannabis can give you that extra
day, cause I've had friends that have used
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and lost their battles,
you know, and I've had friends that have
[SPEAKER_05]: beat cancer with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and maybe it's not right for every
type of cancer, but it's worth exploring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other thing is,
is scary.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not a cannabis user going into
trying cannabis, you have cancer,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's scary enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you've got to take this drug that
a lot of times seems scary on the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times you have to build your
tolerance up to a gram a day is a lot,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's, it's a wow, you know,
but, and my friend to build up,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, my friend, Dave Mesford,
he, he lost the battle.
[SPEAKER_05]: He fought for, I think three years,
four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was taking a gram a day and he
built up to that tolerance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, that's a lot, you know,
I think he was at two grams a day at one
[SPEAKER_05]: point, and that's, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, but, but if you can get an
extra day or extra month or an extra year
[SPEAKER_05]: of life, I think that's, you know,
that's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth every aspect of it,
you know, because we, we don't understand
[SPEAKER_04]: that like, you know, that's what people,
you know, there's a lot of this chase,
[SPEAKER_04]: but really in those last phases,
it's going to be family.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, how you treated people, you know,
like how you were loved, how you love,
[SPEAKER_04]: and those are going to be the important
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing about this plant,
it shows you that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could show you that before those,
you know, more terminal phases even,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and if we utilize it as a
holistic medicine, it can be as a
[SPEAKER_04]: preventative in some ways, just in our own
psyche, you know, feeling more love,
[SPEAKER_04]: acceptance, these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great way to deal with trauma,
you know, and some people, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: people use alcohol to escape and to tune
out, whereas I feel like plant medicine,
[SPEAKER_05]: psychedelics, cannabis, especially tunes
us in, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It tunes you into music.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tunes you into reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tunes you back into what's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, you know, that's why we're
here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, I think that is one of the big
beauties of the plant is the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like it does in our body,
the connectivity it does in community,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and the, the reach and what
it's, I mean, look at it's what's happened
[SPEAKER_04]: to the world right now with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at one point it was a huge facet in
our industrial formulation and
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural formulation of humanity,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of then got pushed under the rug,
you know, intentionally, unintentionally,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it couldn't be held back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's, it's over, you know,
the whole globe is infatuated with it in a
[SPEAKER_04]: way that it's like, maybe this is one of
our last, last great hopes, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: to evolve humanity as a race, to give us
fuel, food, and, you know, structural
[SPEAKER_04]: building tools to actually change this
kind of continuum of what we've created.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's has everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's such a complete part of our
existence, you know, and it can be used
[SPEAKER_05]: for so many different things besides
healing and all the other things that are,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, obvious to us, I guess,
maybe not to other people, but very
[SPEAKER_05]: obvious to us as far as building,
you know, we can build with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can build houses with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can build concrete.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's just, and there's so many
things, you know, they've been using it
[SPEAKER_05]: for, for rope for the longest time and
textiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even I heard the first four,
like model A, all the fabrics and the
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six were made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hemp is so much, it lasts so much
longer than cotton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody in the cotton industry wants to
hear it, but you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a superior product on so many levels,
you know, and it's a perfect protein.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if we look at it, the protein
and the fats, the quality of nutrition
[SPEAKER_05]: that it can give us and give to places
that, you know, are malnourished.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think there's just so much
potential for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the potential is really limitless.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we haven't even, we barely
cracked the surface on it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're going to do and what you're
seeing, you know, cause like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: every, a lot of people are on Instagram,
but you go to LinkedIn and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like professionals doing like real
professional shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like at huge levels, you know,
it's a scientist just, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: even in breeding, you know, you hear stuff
on my show, we talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_05]: data driven breeding, but the potential
for breeding and, and marker driven
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding, you know, it's like for,
for traits and for drug discovery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that gets me excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think plant medicine,
full spectrum plant medicine as a whole,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, we were on this, this
trajectory that was completely the
[SPEAKER_05]: opposite of that, where they're like,
Oh, you just take this one molecule and
[SPEAKER_05]: it'll hopefully kill you for this,
but look at all the side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're like, Oh, well, we have this
full spectrum thing that has no side
[SPEAKER_05]: effects or very minimal side effects that
does all these different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can use that and go in all these
different directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we start understanding it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's the beauty of right now
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even, you know, at the conference
was talking to that Martin and he was
[SPEAKER_04]: telling me all these different things of,
you know, basically the science of seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: all these different markers that are
released from different sugars,
[SPEAKER_04]: light, you know, whatever, and you can
manipulate the genetic cycle, the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: growth, all this stuff just through these,
you know, different markers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, ah, and imagine the range of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was telling him, I was like,
okay, if this is just structural,
[SPEAKER_04]: and say conventional farming, what about
say like non-conventional farming,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you do have living soil biome and
all these kinds of things, the enzymatic
[SPEAKER_04]: response and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's creating more of these factors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's more, you know, just the net
of factors and the range of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, he's like, it just keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just like, wow, can totally change.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, and that's what
people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, we've, we've got our,
our phenotypes that everybody understands.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got the genotypes that are hidden
inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've got the chemo type
expressions that, that we're looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: these chemical expressions that get
changed, you know, they can be changed by
[SPEAKER_05]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can get changed by the nutrition,
just like the phenotype can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that's what like,
um, you know, when phylos come online and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, the beginning and
everything, we started working with them
[SPEAKER_04]: and gave them all the OGs that we had,
you know, kosher kush, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: ghost OG, fire OG, uh, sour best shit
ever, skywalker OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that, that headband,
that was the OG one, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're like, this is all the same
cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm like, oh, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause the highs are different and they,
you know, and I've kept, I kept them
[SPEAKER_04]: really healthy and so where they weren't
having like morphology issues of through
[SPEAKER_04]: degradation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're, you know, I'm like,
still to this day, I'm like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're the same cut or if they're S
ones, but they're really close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll tell you the Josh D and the
ghost, they, they had the same cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: They went through different paths.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I got them back and grew them
side by side and they grew very
[SPEAKER_05]: differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but they were definitely related,
like they seem to have been cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same, you know, it's all the
same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had the headband cut that our friend
Noel had brought.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's the one that brought it to NorCal
as headband.
[SPEAKER_05]: He had got it from Josh and Josh was like,
you can't call it OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he called it headband and he told,
he lied to us for years and we all,
[SPEAKER_05]: we all called it headband, but it was just
the Josh DOG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it yielded really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ghost that I had didn't yield
nearly as well, but, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the Skywalker OG I have yields
amazing, you know, it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that G cut one, whatever, chunky,
chunky, crowned out, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the SPSC kind of looks similar,
but doesn't stack as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, but I, you know, for me,
there is high differences and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so I'm like, okay, epigenetic
changes that probably happened along the
[SPEAKER_05]: way because people have put their energy
into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've, along with, you know,
bacteria, there's like systemic bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: that's in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that happen to the life of the
horticultural.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stressors, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have stress, whether it's pests or
whether it's pathogen or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: or environmental, we have these stressors
that are going to manipulate the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, to say it's the same plant
after it goes through these paths in
[SPEAKER_05]: different directions, it's, it's not the
same plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tissue culture, whether it can take it
back, you know, that's, there's the
[SPEAKER_05]: argument of, okay, well we can take off
these epigenetic changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that fully.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, and they're studying
methylation now and some different things
[SPEAKER_05]: and, uh, but, you know, it's all exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're just scratching the
surface of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and in 10 years, we're going to know a
lot more about the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to know a lot more about
ourselves, uh, you know, and we're in this
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful place, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I feel like we're in the infancy of
something that's going to be long
[SPEAKER_05]: standing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to have great impact over the
next hundred, 200, 300 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're alive as, as, you know,
as mankind, as long as we're alive,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to have impact on the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even look at like, um,
you know, that, uh, the Chinese
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacopoeia from, you know, pre 2000 or
pre, you know, over 2000 years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they, you know, the plant
was, they called it what the plant of a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred cures or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had more medicinal uses than any other
plant in the book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then to where we're now 2000 plus
years later, still talking about that book
[SPEAKER_04]: then, and it being representative of what
this plant can offer in you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: pre industrial times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's huge, you know, and you know,
when we're discovering that, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: first agricultural set of cannabis was in
Tibet, you know, they're finding now,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and they just discovered they're
like, well, this predates what we knew
[SPEAKER_04]: before.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were obviously growing this for
some reasons back then already,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that just like,
but the dog and these things, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: certain plants, uh, helped our
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cultural, um, kind of evolution in ways
that other plants didn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it, these medicinal plants,
like even you look at ayahuasca,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how, who, who, who knew to
combine ministerial apps, his copy and
[SPEAKER_04]: chacruna are these two plants together to
make this potion, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who, who told them that?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that discovery, you know,
you know, so like, even like when,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I was like six years old,
I'm in Nebraska, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lincoln, these plants were in this
dude's backyard, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: me and my friend, my neighbor friend,
we just see him, you know, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they were fucking calling me, you know,
and I'm like, I jumped the fence,
[SPEAKER_04]: ripped them all out the ground,
took them back to my house, had one of
[SPEAKER_04]: those blue little plastic swimming pools,
Phil, put them in there filled with water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm me and my friend were just like,
with our feet barefoot, tromping on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my dad comes out and was like,
what the fuck, you know, like military
[SPEAKER_04]: guy, you know, like, you know,
and so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, you know, he didn't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't, you know, he smoked cigarettes,
but didn't like, you know, there was no
[SPEAKER_04]: reference of drug culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nature, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's this thing that's saying like,
you're attracted to me, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, as societies and tribes
and cultures over millennia, how much of,
[SPEAKER_04]: how much has that plant guided our
evolution?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and here we are into this phase
of the most technical time of humanity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in current day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's this plant fully embedded and
entangled all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's so strange that the
prohibition happened when it happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like right when technology is kicking
off, there's this cannabis prohibition,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's like, and it's right around
the same time that technology kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: boomed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then now, you know, the 50 years
later, we're 40 years later, we're coming
[SPEAKER_05]: back to it and understanding that it's not
such a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually makes the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that needs to be
studied.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even like, you know, you can see
what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even myself, you know, I was super
aggressive when I was younger and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and it just, made it rounded the
edges, you know, and it really helped me
[SPEAKER_04]: see myself in a way that I didn't need to
be aggressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't need to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can be softer, more patient,
you know, more understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can be less arrogant and, you know,
less of an egomaniac.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant really shows you that,
you know, really, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, if you say something that was
maybe self-centered or rude or something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you smoke some weed and everyone's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be thinking about that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and you'll be thinking that that
wasn't the right thing to do and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause this plant, you know, it's trying,
it's doing its best to make it better,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and on a deeper level, I think that
we are who we are because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: experiences we've had and the trauma that
we've had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we all have this unique lens that
we see the world through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you're able to smoke
cannabis, some of those traumas can kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of get moved over here and then we can see
the world, how it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think psychedelics will even do
that further.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll take more of those filters off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're like, Whoa, cause ego
really makes us not, not necessarily who
[SPEAKER_05]: we are, but ego can totally screw us up,
you know, and make us see the world from a
[SPEAKER_05]: completely different perspective,
have negative impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more we can kind of strip away
that ego, the more we can become good
[SPEAKER_05]: people and make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it, it lies to us consistently.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to get what it needs,
which it wants to be permanent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wants to be stagnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wants to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, the freedom doesn't happen
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, if we can, you know,
utilize this plant, step back,
[SPEAKER_04]: see the ego, see its entanglement of a
version of attachment and what it's kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of doing to our, to our brain,
you know, and through a fear response or
[SPEAKER_04]: basically, or a, you know, desire response
or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if we can see that by just,
you know, stepping aside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, ego so desperately wants you to feel
special.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you want to feel special ego
tells you that you need to be special.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You deserve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you deserve to be special or that you
deserve to be different than everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, I think our job is to just
come, come here, do what we're best at to
[SPEAKER_05]: the best of our ability and try to leave
something good for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I think, you know,
we have this term called Bodhichitta,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, which is the altruistic mind
that wishes to achieve enlightenment for
[SPEAKER_04]: the sake of all other beings, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's a being called a
Bodhisattva, which has taken that mind as
[SPEAKER_04]: its core essence of, you know,
experience here and really altruistically
[SPEAKER_04]: tries to help others in a way that's
ultimate, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this plant really,
you know, can help that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is where the true happiness will
come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we're, when we're not based
in our arrogant, egoic, entanglement,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we can step back and see things
altruistically and really help others,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this, you know, saying,
you know, for as long as space remains,
[SPEAKER_04]: for as long as sentient beings remain
until then may I too remain to dispel the
[SPEAKER_04]: miseries of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and that's kind of the
essence of the Bodhisattva mind,
[SPEAKER_04]: which really this plant in my,
you know, eyes fully entangles that
[SPEAKER_04]: essence and everyone that it doesn't
matter what you believe, what you think,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you, you know, eat, what you drink,
usually people that consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: when they do it, they feel better.
[SPEAKER_04]: They feel happier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they, whether they know it or not,
they're on the path to spiritual
[SPEAKER_05]: enlightenment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole Bodhisattva, the principles
behind it, I think it's amazing because
[SPEAKER_05]: spiritual enlightenment is something that
whether you know you're on that path or
[SPEAKER_05]: not, if you're smoking cannabis or you
take plant medicine, you're on that path.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, that evolution process is
something that you know, most of us are
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to escape in our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's really, I think the
human nature and I think it's all beings
[SPEAKER_04]: nature actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cause you can set, see that even if
you put a flame towards a bug,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to go away from the flame,
not into the flame.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even on a ant level, it doesn't want to
suffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that most, the reason most
people are doing the things they're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: is cause they don't want to suffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they think that they're going to do
the things that are going to eliminate
[SPEAKER_04]: that suffering or they're not going to
suffer, you know, but most of us are doing
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that make us suffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we are not informed, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think if people really focus on
love, you know, compassion and really,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, you know, selflessness, you know,
which happens from mindfulness,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you don't have to be in your
thought pattern of your ego of what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to convince your brain to believe
through being special or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can just be in a breath and be
aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we can shut that off.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times, most people don't even
know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took me a long time of even trying
to do that before I learned how to shut it
[SPEAKER_05]: off.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like to where I'm living in the
moment I'm living in that breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally that, that flow state mind really
like, you know, if you're an athlete or
[SPEAKER_04]: high level athlete or musician,
you can really relate with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, but you know, it's kind
of, it's similar, you know, jujitsu
[SPEAKER_05]: changed my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changed my life for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially that flow state and combining
it with cannabis is another one where all
[SPEAKER_04]: the good students love cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason everybody that does jujitsu
or martial arts, I mean, I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: guys, because you can get in that state
where you're not thinking you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: reacting and you're moving and flowing
without having to think about what am I
[SPEAKER_05]: doing next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause the second you start thinking about
what you're doing next, you're going a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: slower than you would if you're just
reacting and flowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, and I'm not even that
good at jujitsu.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not good at all at jujitsu,
but I love jujitsu and I love what it does
[SPEAKER_05]: for my body and for my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that I need to do a lot
more of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, no, it's a really amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrestled with, you know, all through
school and stuff and did some jits and my
[SPEAKER_04]: kid did some jits and, uh, you know,
like it's that anything that you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be doing an intense active sport that
you have to, like you said, you have to be
[SPEAKER_04]: mindful and, you know, um, present and not
be thinking, or you're not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: perform well, whether it be surfing,
snowboarding, you know, like deep powder
[SPEAKER_04]: and trees and, or climbing, you know,
it's all these things take a focus that if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're thinking, I mean, don't get me
wrong, climbing is analytical,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like it's less flow state.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've seen my friend that climbs,
you know, free solo, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 500,000 foot stuff, free solo,
that dude's in the flow state and he ain't
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking, you know, he's like,
what's the same thing cooking on the line
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're working in a kitchen or when
you're cooking or whether you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: jujitsu, it's all about preparation,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're prepared, even growing to a
degree, like if you're prepared ahead of
[SPEAKER_05]: time, you're going to have a lot better
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you might get lucky,
you might get lucky in jujitsu,
[SPEAKER_05]: you might get lucky in the kitchen,
but, uh, if you're not prepared,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not going to have as good a
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, is like, cause you don't
have to really think about what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can flow, even in the kitchen,
you have all your ingredients laid out in
[SPEAKER_05]: front of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have a lot better results
than if you're scrambling around the
[SPEAKER_05]: kitchen, finding stuff, you know,
at the last minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and it translates to so many things
like it, you know, buying stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: you go to the grocery shop and they're out
of the thing that you needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That day, you know, and that happens all
the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of people, and it's like,
if you're prepared in advance,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to have a lot more success.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, creating that foundation and
anything that you're going to basically
[SPEAKER_04]: have success in is clutch, you know,
and, and re really, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding the causal nature of things
and then breaking down that formula and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and getting prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a huge part of anything,
especially spiritual practice,
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation, music, martial arts,
any high level sport, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, even with surfing, if you can
surf and you can be good, but if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: not in shape, you can fucking drown,
you know, like with a quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it's like, you think, you know,
oh, last time I surfed, I could surf this,
[SPEAKER_04]: this size, you know, but you get out there
and can't paddle and you'd be like in the
[SPEAKER_04]: impact zone, just like, you know,
the re rethinking life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got caught on the wrong side of a set
and you have another wave crashing on you
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, it's all bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's re really good as, um,
nothing's, you know, I've, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've climbed a lot of stuff in Yosemite
and stuff and, um, but nothing's,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, put a, uh, reality check on me more
than almost drowning and big set or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cause it's like, you get to a
point where you can't even breathe,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though you're above surface,
you know, you're so exhausted and winded
[SPEAKER_04]: from holding your breath and like taking
beatings that you come up and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: like hyperventilated almost that you can't
even breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though you're above the surface,
it's like, I've gotten a lot of water in
[SPEAKER_05]: my lungs before and it's not fun,
you know, and thought I was going to die.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I experienced that at a very young
age.
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of, it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things that you experience at a
young age can be really beneficial,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially near death experiences.
[SPEAKER_05]: You learn how fragile life is to a degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was in my thirties before I
really understood, but I understood life a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot more from almost dying as a kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, I almost OD'd as a kid as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think those kinds of things,
like put the, you know, the experience of
[SPEAKER_05]: life and the fragility of life into
perspective a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think a lot of us,
we just, we were invincible during our
[SPEAKER_05]: twenties, you know, it wasn't,
it wasn't until the thirties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you start, and I think you start
losing friends, you know, from,
[SPEAKER_05]: from everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you get in your forties,
now I'm getting in my forties and then I
[SPEAKER_05]: was talking to some of my friends in their
fifties and they're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: just wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifties is where you really start losing
your friends, your health starts to go,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, your forties, you might lose
your vision a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you lose your hairline,
you know, but, but yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aging is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny, the knowledge that you get
over time, it's like the years move
[SPEAKER_05]: faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year seems a little bit faster than
the year before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of my uncles put it into
perspective that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're five years old, a year is 20%
of your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're 50, you know, it's,
it's a one 25th of your life or a hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's a 1% of your life,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really put it, I mean, that's a really bad
analogy right there, but like,
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as like every year, it's basically
that one year is shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems like they just go from one
season to the next a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt, even if you're good at
mindfulness practice and breath focus,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cause I've, you know,
I've, I try to stay pretty present and try
[SPEAKER_04]: not to think about even, you know,
my first teacher told me, he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: bro, your brain's already like clogged up
with memories and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you got to eliminate a lot of
that stuff so you could memorize things
[SPEAKER_04]: and get, makes the space, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but what I realized over the time is
if I'm not looking back on the past and
[SPEAKER_04]: being present and aware and what's
happening, time's non-existent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when I look back at the things
and the moments and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the, the, the range and how,
you know, it seems really quick,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if I start to go from this moment back
throughout this day, then yes,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like it's quite long and all the
experiences are quite rich, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I'm looking from here to there,
wow, man, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't like to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Thanksgiving to Christmas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even watching my son grow up and
everything and become a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: start to become a young man and like,
man, it was like, he was so sweet,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like now it's like, you're like,
bro, you're like, you don't even want me
[SPEAKER_04]: to hug you in public barely bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's amazing how fast time passes in
some ways and how slow it is in others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all just perception and
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the thing is it's you know,
they say from a Buddhist perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't, you know, they believe time's
an illusion, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And really cause it impermanence is a
truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a continual flux in all things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's impermanent.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the, all these planetary
structures and their movement and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything, they're always in a flow and
always in a continual flux.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is no fixed moment actually,
you know, it's like what's happened,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's happening and what's yet to happen,
you know, is how it would be broke down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But time, you know, that's the stagnation
that we're trying to fixate our you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: our ego wants to make it real,
you know, make it stable and make it,
[SPEAKER_04]: make it solid and still, you know,
we want it to last forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even our point of view, you know,
that's the ego wants it to be solid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, this is real.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what truth, you know, the reality is
it's not like you think with most things,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, even if we're accurate,
you know, even like with impermanence,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's a permanent thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's like whatever 16,
some types of permanence is, but like
[SPEAKER_04]: impermanence being one of them,
but even all the conceptual aspects of it
[SPEAKER_04]: and everything, they're still,
they're still representations of our
[SPEAKER_04]: awareness and how we're perceiving things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in its true essence, all those fade
away, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is how it is and what's happening
is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once we start to make it relative to
our experience and whatever, we're still
[SPEAKER_04]: taking away of the depth and the
subtleties of it actually on a true level,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least, you know, in my opinion,
you know, it's like really what's crazy is
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so subtle, so vast, so simple and so
deep, you know, all in the same aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, time is a good one to kind
of get lost in or the fact that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: exist actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fourth dimension.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I had a psychedelic
experience from nitrous oxide when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was, it's funny cause like we
talk about nitrous and people think of it
[SPEAKER_05]: hippie crack or whatever, you know,
it's a strong, it can be a strong one,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and I had a full melt,
the first full melt DMT trip I ever had
[SPEAKER_05]: was on nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they do the combo?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the experience from the nitrous
oxide and I was at a rave and I was in the
[SPEAKER_05]: VIP area and there was a bean bag and
someone just handed me a big punching ball
[SPEAKER_05]: balloon and I had hit this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Oh, there's a, there's a bean
bag right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I had a full melt experience and I
basically went to this place and I
[SPEAKER_05]: understood everything, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff that you can't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't put it into words.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of friends coming back here,
but I really, I woke up and I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: how long I was out for, but it felt like a
very long time and my friend's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, where were you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, dude, you guys got,
I tried to get all my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was no balloon when I woke up,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And literally I had to get all my friends
to tell them everything that I understood
[SPEAKER_05]: because I understood everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understood existence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understood everything and got my friends
together and I couldn't put it into words.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the most frustrating thing ever
because I had totally understood it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this dimension, in this plane,
I could not put it into words because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: more than we can comprehend in this
existence.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one thing I took away from this
whole experience, and this was,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was 17 years old, is that we're all
going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm 47 now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like literally 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what in the end, we're all okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I, I remember one time smoking a
grandma DMT one night and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it got pretty high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously with that, hitting it out the
bong, you know, back when we didn't really
[SPEAKER_04]: know how to smoke it as well, you know,
like 20 some years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember seeing the plant on the
table, you know, and the soil and the
[SPEAKER_04]: container and myself, and I remember
seeing the plant and me exact same energy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, but the table was different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil was a little different and the
pot was different, but me and the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: were the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, ah, you know, really
having that realization that all living
[SPEAKER_04]: things are sharing you know, the similar
type of energy, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then they even proved with DMT that
they say that all, you know, carbon based
[SPEAKER_04]: life has DMT in it, you know, and it's
like, you're like, wow, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: big lessons come from these psychedelic
experiences a lot of times, and we can't
[SPEAKER_04]: really explain the depth of them in a lot
of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that this common,
you know, thing is that everything's
[SPEAKER_04]: interconnected.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all of the same source,
you know, energy source, light,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, you know, and then, and they're
just similarity that's much larger than a
[SPEAKER_04]: difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's like, you know,
it can come in all kinds of different ways
[SPEAKER_04]: and perspectives and, you know,
perceptions, but DMT is so wild because
[SPEAKER_05]: you can have so many different types of
trips.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the same experience every
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Salvia is a wicked one, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like, when it comes to plant
medicine, Salvia is basically not a good
[SPEAKER_05]: starting point for most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the end point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you only do it a couple of times
or once.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't start there because you may
never want to do anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think that's what psychedelics are
about, then you probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the, I have the most respect
for Salvia actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't, you're going to be in big
trouble, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like one of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, well, you know,
it's like the opposite of DMT experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but like similar message.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like similar message,
different, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Different path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, psychedelics are pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, mushrooms,
it's funny now mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: People take micro doses now and I
appreciate micro doses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like micro doses for public speaking and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as we never did micro doses back in
the day, it was like a half an eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you only could eat a gram, you were
like disappointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to share that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half an eighth is the starting point for
the real ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we had more mild mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care, but we always had trips.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we weren't, we weren't taking mushrooms
just to feel okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were taking mushrooms to experience
something that lasted a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it changed our state of
mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't just like, oh, we're not going
to drink tonight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to eat a little bit of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the whole forest to breathe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ground should be breathing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything should be coming alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're micro dosing LSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're micro dosing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing micro doses of everything,
including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is like heavily micro dose now
compared to what we were doing when we
[SPEAKER_05]: were younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, even the LSD thing,
you know, like I've been micro dosing for
[SPEAKER_04]: decades because, you know, when you,
when you have the vial, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get yourself into the trouble,
you know, if you're at a show or something
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, and then this, when I
realized it, it's like, oh, every time I
[SPEAKER_04]: remember I was at a widespread panic show
at the Cuthbert, you know, and it was my
[SPEAKER_04]: friend and, you know, we're dumb dosing
everyone, you know, and little micros,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the, you know, clear eyes
bottle, but you don't realize that a drop
[SPEAKER_04]: out of a clear ice bottles, like three
hits really, you know, maybe it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so you're just like, you're actually
giving real hits, you know, every time
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take another, I'll take another next
thing, you know, you don't hear anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just, you know, seeing all the sound
come out and light and can't even talk or
[SPEAKER_04]: think anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, Oh, you know, so,
you know, even back then I started micro
[SPEAKER_04]: dosing, you know, meaning diluting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's more safe, you know, you don't
have to like, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, Oh, you have to take 10 drops
actually to get one drop, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: one hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's way safer actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a, that's a great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 10 to one is a great approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got to get yourself in
trouble on purpose with that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, it's not like you're
like even, you know, doing events or doing
[SPEAKER_04]: talks or podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, you know,
it's like, are you going to really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't need that many, you just take
one and then, you know, you have energy to
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, but you know, you do not get
going on stage, you know, you don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: to be like, you know, so it was different,
you know, like with the cactus for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, I took cactus every day for
like three years and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that was kind of microdose it too,
or I guess you could say that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, you know, I would take a,
you know, I mean, I would take the same
[SPEAKER_04]: amount now that I'd take if I mean,
me and the lady are going out for a night
[SPEAKER_04]: and having a good time, whatever I'm,
you know, five, 10, 15 mils of this gel
[SPEAKER_04]: that my, you know, family makes very
special recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and so I took that every day for
three years of my preliminary stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, an upper division U of O stuff
and, you know, really, uh, utilize it as
[SPEAKER_04]: like, kind of like the limitless pill,
you know, from that movie, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, you know, just like microdose
and LSD is similar thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, you memorize really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot of energy, stamina,
awareness, you know, and it can creativity
[SPEAKER_05]: outside the box thinking all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, you'd see a lot of these
upper, you know, hedge funds, CEOs or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those dudes are all microdosing,
you know, they're all, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the people, not all, but most people I
know at upper echelon thinking and
[SPEAKER_04]: creativity and action, they're on
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_05]: In one form or another for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, well, now there's so many options
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like back in the day,
there was like one or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's like, there's a wide spectrum of
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's MDMA pens, you know, I know
there's DMT pens and mushroom pens,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like all these things you're
like, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now just keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how it's old school myself,
but yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's funny because we've,
we've started to go in this direction of
[SPEAKER_05]: convenience and I do love the pre-roll
hand roll model for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a huge hash hole guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may do a hash hole in metrics.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as I do like the convenience
for the hand roll, but everything's gone
[SPEAKER_05]: into pencil, like rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think rosin carts are good, but you got
to use them right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't taste for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like rosin carts aren't good after a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if, you know, the first 10 hits of a
rosin cart are all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, then they go, it goes downhill
really fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you see these two gram carts now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, why would you have a two gram
cart?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I would prefer a half gram cart,
especially a rosin cart, a half gram rosin
[SPEAKER_05]: cart over two grams of anything because
after the first gram, it's all garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I don't, I don't want it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would much rather have a color
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go from this nice light color to this
dark color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, but we do live in this world of
convenience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with everything people are like,
Oh, how can I, how can I get it easily?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how is it easily accessible?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand the pre-roll because I
want people to experience the same kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: joint I get to smoke and I take the time
and effort to roll these perfect joints.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would love to share that with the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm like, Hey, that excites me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it gets to a level where they want
over convenience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing is just a patch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I just want the cannabis patch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, maybe that's for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not, yeah, some people they'll,
they'll get that and they'll enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for me, it's like, there's gotta be
the, I like the smoking side of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that whole experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ritual aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I like roll, you know how it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I mean, that's kind of how,
even when I started back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, you know, I loved herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you get into high school,
out of high school, you got, you get the
[SPEAKER_04]: ounce, you sell the three quarters and you
keep the quarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're like, well, I need more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you sell the four ounces,
you need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sell the three quarters of a
pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: You keep the quarter pound, all the home,
you know, it's like, just kind of builds,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like that aspect is just something
that's really sweet and special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to really be the one that's having the
herb and then rolling the joint and doing
[SPEAKER_04]: the thing and being that kind of provider
all the way to now, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a ritual aspect in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, I mean, now I like to basically
roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to put it in the grinder and I put
rosin or hash in the grinder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grind it up together and I roll it cone
that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I smoke and you know, and people like,
we'll be, you know, like even at MJ,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, dude, this, this thing went
around this six person circle six,
[SPEAKER_04]: eight times, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a fucking quarter, third gram of
rosin in there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, ah, yeah, no, that's how it
makes it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise it just gets, or it runs like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes people want to hit them too
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they're like, you know, they're
like, Oh, joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second, the first hit, they might take
a small one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second hit, they're like trying to,
yeah, they're, they're trying to take it
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing's like, you know, so like,
you know, rolling them with the rosin or
[SPEAKER_04]: the hash that keeps them up or even like
the old school hash that like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what I'd like to do is do like
70 to, you know, 120 or 70 to 160 and just
[SPEAKER_04]: granulated and air dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just put that, you know,
grind that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love good bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was raised on good bubble hash
from the early nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we had bubble bags, my,
my buddy, Micah showed me how to make them
[SPEAKER_05]: on silk screens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had like this ritual with a five
gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to stir it one direction,
had to stir it in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to let it settle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with a solo cup, you're scooping
it over, you know, you're literally
[SPEAKER_05]: scooping it over the silkscreen and we let
it dry on the silkscreen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know any better, no any
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but the hash was, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was like, we discovered gold,
you know, at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, back then it was gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I remember doing the like,
you know, whatever early 2000,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, with the bags and,
but then the, like the 20, 25,
[SPEAKER_04]: 28 and 40 were like the cream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like we're doing dry trim catching
like, you know, these hay strains or
[SPEAKER_04]: golden pineapple, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, those bars, each one of those,
you know, I'd make a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 28, 25 bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd make a 40 bar, make a 70 bar and
really, you know, putting it in the three
[SPEAKER_04]: whole, three whole bowls of the Illidelf
back then, you know, and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the 20, the 20 something and the 40
something were the best of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, I think it's catching the
smallest trichomes, but after they've
[SPEAKER_04]: shriveled up, so it's actually like
probably a 70, it's catching, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so like, but it's just different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember making these bricks and like
pressing all like, you know, like
[SPEAKER_04]: silkscreen on silkscreen, paper towel
underneath and just pressing all the water
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them would look like shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the outside, but you break it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be so gold, like a little gold bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That 45, we get some amazing tones,
like different, different hues of red
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes or orange, some really cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those were amazing days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I remember, I remember making some
out and like, you know, I was out at
[SPEAKER_04]: Crestwell out in my, you know,
I remember snowing and I was doing this
[SPEAKER_04]: golden pineapple, you know, wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I wasn't micro dosing, but like
when the trichomes started to release
[SPEAKER_04]: heavy, it looked like almost like an
iridescence in the foam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, fucking something's
happening, you know, cause it was so cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so snowy and it was just like,
everything was perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it was just releasing in the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dumping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just like, fuck, you know,
this is big old spoonful at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were the best, you know,
cause there was sometimes we'd wash stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: and we didn't know the genetics or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wash it and there'd be nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then other times you'd be like,
wow, we got, cause we did a lot of frozen
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would have frozen sugar trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we figured that out, it was a game
changer, but not everything watched the
[SPEAKER_05]: same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you'd be trying something for the
first time excited and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, there's not even a spoonful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it'd be kind of junky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're like, oh, this isn't,
you know, and that's what I noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the ones that like with the
dry trim method with a big trichome,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like the amount you're catching in
the, like, you know, in the one 20,
[SPEAKER_04]: the one 60, you're like, what do this look
crazy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you know, and then, or versus,
you know, some of the stuff that say we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: give you, that'll ghost you on a,
a fresh frozen wash, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like golden or Trinity, the little
straight ghost you, you know, but then you
[SPEAKER_04]: dry it and it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like full melt, you know,
like, it's like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the strains that on a fresh frozen
will give you a ghost, but then on a dry
[SPEAKER_04]: trim will give you something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the shit will look like fresh
rose.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll, you know, crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah, it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hash is so wild and, and you know,
they're just really dialing in the
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really amazing the directions
they're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love rosin, but I still just love good
bubble hash, you know, for, for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, dabble will bubble hash is
pretty great too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why I mean, this 90,
you full melt and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, it's like better than
rosin anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like not to try to be a,
I'm not trying to say this or be a hater
[SPEAKER_04]: to rosin or anything, but I don't know,
you know, like pressure, heat,
[SPEAKER_04]: parchment, you know, that combo with all
this micro plastic and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I can't really, you know,
I don't know if there's stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do know for sure in like some 90,
you full melt that just caught with the
[SPEAKER_04]: bag, there's less chances of micro plastic
and stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there is some pressurized squashed
plastic thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm excited about all these static
machines coming out now too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Static's awesome because we talk about,
you know, solvent list and they say bubble
[SPEAKER_05]: hash solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, water in my chemistry book in high
school, it says water is the master
[SPEAKER_05]: solver, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, it'll go through granite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally in big bold letters going
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then solvent list comes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Nicky T and I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: He coined a term.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very unique and still accepted today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we change language and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, true solvent lists is static
bubble.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean not bubble hash, but the second we
put it through water, any sort of sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I loved sift back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Keith.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, remember when Cuban grow came on,
dude, doing that kind of static.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, with a microscope,
pulling particles out, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah, you know, and it's funny cause
like the cameras that we had back then,
[SPEAKER_05]: weren't like the cameras we have now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, he, there was still
incredible photos on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was over 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, even like, you know,
like Eric, Nick shots is a good friend of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine and everything, you know,
and like seeing the transition from,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what's happening with,
you know, like him, Nick with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you know, land, uh, zoom
gardens, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also like Marvin surface area,
these, you know, it's insane bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be able to see that on such a high
scientific level, that even, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: only people that are really doing that
level of stacking are like bug,
[SPEAKER_04]: bug shooters and you know, like people
like shooting stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dynasty genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like his stuff, his photography is just
like, some of these guys are just so
[SPEAKER_05]: skilled, uh, quality of photos and their
photography, their artists artists because
[SPEAKER_05]: there's, and there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people just see the picture and
they get excited about this picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know what it's just like with
genetics and other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know really what went into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They see the end result.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, oh, that's amazing,
but they don't understand how much clarity
[SPEAKER_03]: there is on that flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvesting that plant and preparing that
plant and getting it at the right moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then stacking those photos properly
and having the light perfect and all these
[SPEAKER_05]: things that have to happen for you to get
that photo, you know, it's, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get excited because I mean,
I've seen the process and I understand it
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you started understanding it's
like, wow, it's really, especially if you
[SPEAKER_05]: have a photographer that's like trying to
learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, well, it doesn't look
like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because of this, this,
this, and this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even the cultivation, like if you use
stuff where you have burnt tips on your
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves, if you're using stuff,
salts that burn, burn your tips,
[SPEAKER_05]: your leaves a little bit, it's not going
to look as good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the photo is not going to look
nearly as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even if the flowers pushed hard,
it's, you can tell, you know, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: people that can tell when you can tell,
you can tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Swollen backs where they're like over
swollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like someone doing steroids
or someone like being like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: heavy organic, you know, fed grass grass,
you know, Fred beef, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a glow to it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they both have a glow to it in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without a doubt that, you know,
and that's, I think that's the cool thing
[SPEAKER_04]: is, you know, whatever floats your boat
with this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this plant has countless expressions
and there's something for everybody and
[SPEAKER_04]: humans have countless expressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, I think that combination is,
is, is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever you want to do,
just grow more weed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: plant more seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like do more, you know, that's if you
love it, double down on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think not doing it for
money, doing it because you love it and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're devoted to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one of those things that you feel
aligned with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never consult anyone or give them
information if they're doing it for money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to love the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to love the, you know,
because, you know, the money can be a side
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're devoted and you're
giving it your all for sure, whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: field you're in doesn't have to be weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But money is going to come.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that, that devotion and that heart and
that care, that's rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I love about Capulet and
the Mac one, say what you want about Mac
[SPEAKER_05]: one as a genetic or you like the smoke,
don't like the smoke, but the way he gave
[SPEAKER_05]: out the cuts, that's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it, it's not seen across the
board typically these days where,
[SPEAKER_05]: or if it is, people don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mac one was something that was never
supposed to be sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be given and shared
with good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I, I love that about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like that's just one of those
good examples that we can all learn from.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that kind of intention and that
kind of like, you know, stewardship.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: That means something, you know,
and that's something special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those kinds of vibes should be,
you know, something that we're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, seeing and emulating and
whatever way we can, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we got to, we got to give our heart
however we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a good, that's a good,
that's a good example of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that was a special plan at that time
and what it was, you know, the look,
[SPEAKER_04]: the turf, the structure, what it was doing
and what it did for the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally too, within that cross,
like for you to get those turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of the other crosses that
I've seen within the progeny, some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a, the Mac 69, which was very hazy,
very Colombian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you got this Mac one that's very
soft and it looks amazing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've seen it in some amazing,
gross outdoors and greenhouse where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you look across from 50 feet away
and you're like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It has this pink glow and it's super
frosty and it's like, they're not tall
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like these amazing delicate,
you know, extremely special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of a plant that was going
around Eugene.
[SPEAKER_04]: We called it the Dawn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, or, you know, they call it the kid
next door, neighbor kid, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a, you know, train wreck by
purple Laffy and it was similar,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like see it across a room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pink blah, you know, like whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you know, the, those ones
are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really what they kind of give that glow,
no matter how big the field is or how big
[SPEAKER_04]: the room is, you see those, you know,
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two 2018 Leo from a fish and I got some of
the seeds from Th Caesar, one of my
[SPEAKER_05]: buddies, and he gave me these seeds and
they were super expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: $2,500 on the aftermarket is what they
were going for, you know, for a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a pop them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see, I don't care about this
aftermarket thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see how good these seeds are
because I didn't really know Leo as a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're friends now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it was earlier than that,
but when I popped them, we had popped 800
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were popping them in my buddy's
backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was this little patch that you
could see from 30 feet away and everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: would be like, what are those?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't just the way they looked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, there's a lot of stuff,
Oreos and some of the stuff that looks
[SPEAKER_05]: really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a really amazing look that would
attract you to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff, it was like the look,
the smell, the structure, everything about
[SPEAKER_05]: every one of the plants was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you could see it in all these
different expressions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause there's so many different seeds out
there, but it was like this little patch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a super special one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leo's got some, some of those still
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's supposed to drop some off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for those.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that changed my mind about like the
value of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know he was selling his 200 bucks a
pack even back then and the value of seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and it's all subjective to the
individual, you know, he sold it for 200,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's like these SB dunks that go for
$5,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: These pairs of Nikes, you know,
it's like Nike doesn't sell for that much,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the secondary market, it is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sell value of a seed is so
subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they can do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've always had like high respect
for Fishnado and Leo and like packaging,
[SPEAKER_04]: what he did branding wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can't, if you, if you argue
with it, you're just a hater.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's given me his drops over the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: When he has new drops, he's given me packs
and like, I think his Zotti had the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: gold plant tags and I'm going to like,
dude, that is just, he's always an outside
[SPEAKER_05]: the box thinker.
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants it to be elegant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the, the wax stamps on the
stuff and just the way he takes it to a
[SPEAKER_05]: different level and makes it his own.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I mean, it's, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was the first like that period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been a lot of knockoffs since
then, but like, you know, like even I
[SPEAKER_04]: waxed my, you know, corks for a while
because I, you know, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he's doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wax the fucking cork.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it has this craft feel to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's really, I mean,
it's Louis Vuitton and craft combo.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, really what it reminds me of is
that like crossover of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: fine, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's like, it's like when
you take the finest foods and you'd,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, have a dinner in Humboldt or
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'd be one thing if his genetics
didn't back it, but his genetics are good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he's a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great person, first of all,
because he's a great breeder and his seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: that he put in those expensive packages
where he did spend some money and there
[SPEAKER_05]: was a lot of thought that went into it,
but they're all good genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've, I've always been super happy with
everything that I popped of his.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, that 78 AFI isn't a lot of
the work, you know, I put the 78 AFI to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Sauer OG made the tensens and like,
you know, I mean, I, I've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: work with that and I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every single Fino that popped out of
that 78 AFI by the Sauer OG was epic,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I, I kept the two and the
four, the tensencush two and four,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's only because there just wasn't
that many of them and that's what was left
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were winners.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the three was a winner too,
but these two were better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just like, eh, you know,
just like ended up doing quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: work with it just cause for that fact,
it was, it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, what would that one piece of
[SPEAKER_05]: advice be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go bigger, go harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think sometimes going bigger,
you know, not going big keeps you out of
[SPEAKER_04]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: To really just focus more on helping
instead of focusing on myself and really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I went with that pretty hard,
but if I would have did it more,
[SPEAKER_04]: more pure minded, more wholesomely,
you know, I did it the best I could,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I could have did it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would have, would have created more
happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think even I'm quite a happy guy now,
but you know, I don't want to go through
[SPEAKER_04]: my phases, but I think if I did things
more with an altruistic intention from the
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning, it would have just created
better results in the end, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the results are good,
but you know, you know how we are when
[SPEAKER_04]: our, when we're in our early twenties,
you know, and late teens, early twenties,
[SPEAKER_04]: we do a lot of arrogant, stupid shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think the world's a lot different than
it really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we gain experience and
knowledge over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, it's like, for me,
the beauty of this podcast, I saw Joe
[SPEAKER_05]: Rogan doing his podcast and I felt like
watching him over the years, he got
[SPEAKER_05]: smarter, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, dude, this guy's,
he's more, he talks more intelligently for
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing, but he gets all these
perspectives from all these different
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: High level people too.
[SPEAKER_05]: High level people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like I get high level cannabis
people and people that have experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get a piece of each one of those
people when I do this podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So having you on today has been a great,
great, great podcast and a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like it's one of those ones
where, I've got somebody in the industry
[SPEAKER_05]: who's experienced a lot, who knows a lot
about cannabis, who loves the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: who's a true steward of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if people are looking to find out more
about you, where can they go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Greenbodey.org, gbgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my two, you know, web-based
realities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram's Green Bodey and the real Green
Bodey, obviously LinkedIn, John Bay's
[SPEAKER_04]: Green Bodey, whatever, you know,
Twitter X, whatever, Green Bodey.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, kind of those are the,
those are the, those are the, those are
[SPEAKER_04]: the way you're going to find me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I, I suggest the website
really, you know, because- You're selling
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds on your website?
[SPEAKER_04]: Selling seeds on gbgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're doing some consulting for like
home growers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could reach me through greenbodey
.org, just kind of trying to help people
[SPEAKER_04]: keep it simple and just give this
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, at a scaled level,
people aren't really interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: organics, you know, they want,
they've got to go convention because of
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP and these different aspects,
but on a boutique level, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: organics is kind of our forte.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really want to offer that simplicity
and that information to as many people as
[SPEAKER_04]: I can because, you know, fuck man,
we need more people growing weed in their
[SPEAKER_04]: closet and in their garage and their
bedroom and their, every room in their
[SPEAKER_04]: house and live in their living room,
you know, whatever it takes, like old
[SPEAKER_04]: days, you know, that's- Sleeping next to
their plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have allergies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I used to cure it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, you know, like I'd,
I'd cure and dry everything in my bedroom
[SPEAKER_04]: and just, you know, that any as a,
as you know, when those first few days,
[SPEAKER_04]: the band of Terps are powerful,
you know, you're just like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: am I not even sleeping?
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy, Joe, I'm sure if I went to his
house during trimming, he still has black
[SPEAKER_05]: clone trays where he trims in and he falls
asleep next to him even still.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I, we used to do that all the
time, but he's still living and he's up in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's popular up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we're, we're committed committed
to this plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the prices these days you have to
be, I mean, you know, it's not all about
[SPEAKER_05]: money anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're becoming farmers now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that rock star lifestyle,
I mean, there's still some people,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, but like, it's not about that
rock star life, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, it's about something more for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we live that one too, but yeah,
now it's a lot different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, if you're still getting
good, good money for your, that's good,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and you deserve it if you are,
because it's not easy feed these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, really it's for the heart
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these days and sharing the
