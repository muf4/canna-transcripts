[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're doing a remote from my house
and my special guest for today is Brandon
[SPEAKER_01]: Rust from Bakashi Earthworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Brandon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you have a long history with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a long history with podcasting
from future cannabis projects to several
[SPEAKER_01]: other podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have you as a guest today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really enjoy plant science and I
have a large library of knowledge that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten to take deep dives into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a lot of science white papers too
and I find out and I've kind of figured
[SPEAKER_00]: out what the practical application for a
lot of the sciences for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different processes that are happening in
nature and how we can apply them into
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And replicate that and show it on data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our guests that don't know who you
are, give us a little background on how
[SPEAKER_01]: you got started in cannabis and then what
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cultivating since about 2001,
2002 right around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got into it because some of my
dad younger homies which were my older
[SPEAKER_00]: homies kind of brought me under their wing
and they had already been grown for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years and I was just doing a
bunch of bullshit working with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were having me like mow their yard
and wash their dog and I was just a kid
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was a teenager and you know
washing hydrocorn rock and shit so they
[SPEAKER_00]: could reuse it and their hydro system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing stuff like that and I knew what they
were doing but they kind of tested me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it for a while before I ever got to
see the inside of a garden so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like their little bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little Miyagi approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some karate kid Mr. Miyagi approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of tested me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to see if I was willing to put
in the work and they were also being
[SPEAKER_00]: cautious because they wanted to fucking
protect their own asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an interesting story because I
actually grew up in foster care but I met
[SPEAKER_00]: my father who was who got sent to prison
in 96 and he's still in prison but I got
[SPEAKER_00]: in touch with him through my my mom after
I became an adult when I turned 18 and he
[SPEAKER_00]: basically was like, hey go meet some of my
friends, you know, and so I did and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of how those relationships built.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they knew who I was but they you know,
they couldn't vouch for me back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was just I was just some
fucking punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kid, you know and and so I you know,
I did all the things and I worked worked
[SPEAKER_00]: my way in and I got to know the guys and
they finally brought me in and first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did when they brought me in was
I cut open a galvanized steel conduit to
[SPEAKER_00]: steal power because one of them was an
actual electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knew how to do all the electric work
but he needed wires to clamp on to so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how that's the first thing that I
that like really got me in there because I
[SPEAKER_00]: after I did that, they were like,
I mean they paid me like two grand of
[SPEAKER_00]: super fucking stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, this is such come up,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was you know, cuz I that was like at the
time probably you know, one of the times
[SPEAKER_00]: where I just got a big ass chunk of
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got fucking paid two G's right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like 10 grand in today's terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so yeah, but I started working with
those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with those those guys Dirty Harry
and Triple D down in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually the ones who created the
Afghani bull rider not to be confused with
[SPEAKER_00]: the original bull rider, but this was the
original bull rider crossed to an Afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: and we ran that from probably about 2001
to real hard until about 2009,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I worked with them for about two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had my own partners that I worked
with and had you know, different grows
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there and you know gone to a
bubble went to prison a couple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I ended up you know, every time I
was locked up was like I got to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell out of California place and as soon
as I did everything kind of changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out here to Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working in the legal market out
here, you know, I was able to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: business that had started in San Diego and
incorporated out here and I've been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to really focus in on the cannabis
agronomy and microbiology side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know taking a look at the cultivation
system holistically for everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, biosecurity integrated pest
management to soil fertility health and
[SPEAKER_00]: management data collection environmental,
you know management, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that we do in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canvass cultivation nice and so then tell
us about a Bukashi Earthworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it initially started with I went on to
this Facebook group in like 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the Probiotic Farmers
Alliance and they were talking about you
[SPEAKER_00]: know soil microbiology and about you know
Bukashi, which is usually a like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented organic waste that you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use as basically a bio fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole group that was
dedicated and that that group still
[SPEAKER_00]: exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knowledge it sparked my interest and I
was at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was around 2014 when the price of
cannabis started really dropped because
[SPEAKER_00]: when we started we're selling pounds for
$4,800 a pound or $300 an ounce all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up no matter how much you got like it
didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the price and people were willing
to pay it and then we would you know go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California to the people that
would be running diesel generators and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd have like 200 or 200 lights which
we couldn't really bust that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had multiple houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have like 12 lights here maybe like
four lights over here another four lights
[SPEAKER_00]: over here but we'd go get pick up like
larger packs up in Northern California and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the prices started to decrease over
time and I remember specifically it was
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 I was in San Diego and all the the
way that they did like the permitting you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't like you could get like a
dispensary license but it wouldn't be like
[SPEAKER_00]: zoned so you would just get fine and so
people were just like okay cool we'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: take fine so all these shops started
popping up and then everybody started
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating and it was like and the
landscape started to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the like the period for me
when I really started noticing it because
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds were at like 25 or 2400 dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like damn dude I was like I wonder
if it's gonna you know like it left me in
[SPEAKER_00]: a place thinking like okay I'm gonna have
to rethink like the way that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this because I need to decrease my
overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what actually drove me into
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because I wanted to figure out how
to reduce my my overhead and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: just went for it because I was like let's
let's try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I delved into some of the the the bro
science I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at a lot of the old recipes like
sub cool recipe and coots recipe and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know different recipes that I could find
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a great success and I was
running you know I ran the two gallon ebb
[SPEAKER_00]: and flow buckets you know with the
hydrocon rocks and the little you know
[SPEAKER_00]: little four lighter pattern checkered and
you know I remember the first the first
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that we ever did it was a four
bedroom house and the whole place was
[SPEAKER_00]: converted had three four thousand watt
flowering rooms a thousand watt bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd be pulling out 36 plants in
forever every room every like two weeks or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that you know and we had a
little checkerboard metal halite hps doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the ebb and flow and I did that same exact
system for like 11 years and I ran I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran general three-part general with some
like maybe some additives here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three part by itself was good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I think a lot of us grew up using
three part for the time that was what a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of us had to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we were doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our our hanna meter that was like
the size of a brick you know and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're indestructible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be still measuring our ppm's and
measuring our our ph and topping off our
[SPEAKER_00]: resi's and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's I ended up like losing a
whole room because like the ac failed or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a pump failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what it was but it was
like something mechanical in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like fuck the whole room went
down lost it and I was like like this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking sucks dude that's like thousands
of dollars thousands of fucking dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: that were fucking lost you know and so I
ended up kind of just switching over to
[SPEAKER_00]: like a potting mix but I was still running
I was still running newts you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for like a year before I
switched out completely over to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to relearn everything because
once I started trying to build soils and
[SPEAKER_00]: like figure it out I did I was like I
don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that's basically what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing a certain thing that
worked really really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I like changed up the protocol
and like veered from something else it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like I had to relearn and like understand
the science and what I was like why do I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to add this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I need to add this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's you know and finding out all the
nuances of what elements are there for
[SPEAKER_00]: what and what the levels of where those
should be in accordance to you know total
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble nutrition of that nutrient in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you went to school for agronomy or did
you was that later or you're all self
[SPEAKER_01]: taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: No I'm all self taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I ended up doing was I started to
before I ever got into the commercial side
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivation I was doing soil testing
because I wanted to understand the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the soil levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to try to figure that out so I
could like you know create a program that
[SPEAKER_00]: was that was basically organic that was
all organic that I could implement into a
[SPEAKER_00]: program a complete program and not have to
guess at you know because here's the issue
[SPEAKER_00]: like I've always been able to grow great
wheat but if I have an issue that like
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say appears during week for a flower
and I am addressing it as that deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: symptom appears or that or whatever that
symptom of whatever it might be appears by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that symptom appears we're
already probably about 50 percent into
[SPEAKER_00]: like a deficiency for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm like running my plants and all
of a sudden dude everything's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: getting yellow at the bottoms and I'm
running out of nitrogen it's like oh shit
[SPEAKER_00]: that I shouldn't be doing I shouldn't be
running out of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how much I should have had
in that system at the beginning so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not running out through the system
so that we can do you know basic you know
[SPEAKER_00]: soil builds that contain the proper amount
of nutrition that will allow us to do very
[SPEAKER_00]: very minimal maintenance and get great
results not just quality but that can
[SPEAKER_00]: compete on the the quantity side as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right and consistency so every time you do
it you get the same results or similar
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and so here's the thing so like when
whenever we're running a program or like
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody people that I work with so in the
in the in the instance that they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: my soil my soil comes built it already
meets the target nutritional levels that
[SPEAKER_00]: are built for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've I already know what they are as
far as the total amount of nutrition that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be in soil how it falls into
solution and when we're looking at how we
[SPEAKER_00]: do that we're looking at standard soil
tests and then a saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a standard test will show you
collectively what's in the soil and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated paste test allows you to see
every single element in the parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million that's falling into solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you water that soil as the the
mineral ions that the plant observes the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral nutrition whether it's the
phosphate anion or the divalent form of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium magnesium potassium any of those
things they all they fall into the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution right and they're uptaken in or
diffuse across the membranes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and we can actually look at all of
the mineral ions that are in the water
[SPEAKER_00]: with a saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just looking at the EC and
the PPM I can look at those two factors
[SPEAKER_00]: plus I can look at every single individual
individual element I can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and calcium and potassium and I
can also look at all my secondary all my
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients I can look at things that
are antagonistic like bicarbonate and
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium and chloride and things that I know
if they're going to be high and soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause antagonisms and that system
can be out of balance if those those
[SPEAKER_00]: things are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to look at different types of
data on soil and be able to determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to add into that soil if I don't
meet a target on that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if my target PPM is between eight and a
thousand PPM and then let's say calcium is
[SPEAKER_00]: between 150 and 200 PPM and magnesium is
between 32 and 40 PPM and potassium is
[SPEAKER_00]: between 125 and 150 PPM right and we're
looking at all of these different elements
[SPEAKER_00]: in the actual amount of availability I
know all those targets right so if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a soil and it's not meeting
that target I know what I need to add of
[SPEAKER_00]: what certain element to bring that target
up to a sufficient level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone had a soil and they came to
me and they're like hey can you do a test
[SPEAKER_00]: for me and I can look at their soil I
could look at their pH I could pH balance
[SPEAKER_00]: it I could and let's say it's only at 400
parts per million total soluble salts and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is just kind of low I can look
at that soil and say this is what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need to add in in the exact
quantity to be able to balance the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: out and so what I've done is I've provided
you know those types of services to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that I work with and then I also
provide them with all of those individual
[SPEAKER_00]: base elements so most people will buy a
branded product right like I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: branded products because I take all the
stuff that we're buying in bulk and I
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute this for like home growers and
stuff but like when I'm working with
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial producers I'm selling them 50
pound bags you know and they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective because if you buy a bag of
magnesium sulfate and that's pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: your sole source for magnesium it's going
to be very very efficient to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that into that system it's very
soluble you can also use it in the foiler
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and it's only about maybe 25 bucks
for a 50 pound bag you know and that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to last you know a commercial
producer a long time just that small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount you know and so the larger you
scale if you're buying in bulk these
[SPEAKER_00]: things get even cheaper and so it becomes
you're basically operating the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: that conventional agriculture but you're
using organic amendments you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using natural like organic amendments and
natural minerals you know things like
[SPEAKER_00]: epsom salt or gypsum gypsum is you know
calcium sulfate now that is considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: salt but it's natural it just they it just
in their abundance you can pull it out
[SPEAKER_00]: with a front loader and then they just
micronize it to make it soluble you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they crush it up so it's not treated in
any way it's just kind of pulled out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground and crushed and then like here
you go here's this mineral so we have you
[SPEAKER_00]: know complete lists of what we can use as
far as mineral inputs for different
[SPEAKER_00]: elements and so I try to stick with single
use elements to address single elements
[SPEAKER_01]: that need to be addressed so as far as
testing and all this started if we go a
[SPEAKER_01]: step back you started this as something it
was you were doing it for yourself and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it evolved into a business where
you're helping others yeah well I was
[SPEAKER_00]: always producing cannabis to support
myself that was what I that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I did for forever you know and
I still grow weed at home and shit you
[SPEAKER_00]: know to me right but so it's always been a
business but it was always just you know
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking you know slinging weed to the
fucking homeboys and people that have run
[SPEAKER_00]: that are running delivery services and you
know you know how it goes dude we just
[SPEAKER_01]: face we're trapping yeah but this is
evolved into a real business you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: have because when I got into the
commercial side and people were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: me to like hey like we need to like make
sure I like I need to make sure I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect data somehow I need to be able to
replicate the system over and over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again right and so that's what drove
me even harder on the agronomy because
[SPEAKER_00]: before I got into the commercial space or
the legal space out here in Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm originally from San Diego but
before I got into the legal space I was
[SPEAKER_00]: already testing and I was already like
looking into it and playing around with it
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was like I really hit hard started
learning started getting books started you
[SPEAKER_00]: know taking agronomy courses and things
that so I could really really educate
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and really understand the not just
that soil science but actually like the
[SPEAKER_00]: what I need to add and which quantities
because that's what agronomy really is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's being able to unlock the key to the
castle if you only have you know 75 ppm of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium how much gypsum do you need to add
into that system to bring it up to 150
[SPEAKER_00]: right I know what the all those are and I
built like calculators that can all do it
[SPEAKER_00]: automate it for me now but it it's
figuring all that out and then and then
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it to practice practical use
because if you have a target level for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis right that starts with testing
that was done out of the 70s and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: book called plant analysis handbook which
is where the information comes from like
[SPEAKER_00]: it started off with the leaf tissue
analysis and like what the percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium should be what the percentage of
nitrogen be all those elements you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: a baseline because we can do not just the
soil testing but we can do the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and if we know we're hitting the
specific targets on our saturated paste
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's equating to the right percentage
that we're looking for in tissue then we
[SPEAKER_00]: know those are the right levels but we can
also look at like the overall health like
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you're not guessing and you know
like how to grow good weed to begin with
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can map something out you can see
what it's like to be able to push those
[SPEAKER_00]: targets and see what the standard target
is that's been that's been published in
[SPEAKER_00]: literature versus like what your
healthiest crop looks like you know oh hey
[SPEAKER_00]: I have you know six percent calcium versus
the three three and a half that they
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest you know because their cow I think
the calcium was like two point two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three three point one percent calcium if
you're looking at that book if my memory
[SPEAKER_00]: serves me but it's like ideally I see that
like four and a half to five and a half is
[SPEAKER_00]: is better but I've seen all the way up to
like eight percent in and seen plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: were massive and they were just crushing
right so you know that you can you can
[SPEAKER_00]: learn stuff from the data to like
understanding that it's that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: almost not get too much calcium it's just
that the calcium does have antagonisms
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with phosphorus and other
cations and so delivering too much might
[SPEAKER_00]: upset upset the nutrient balance but if
you can keep giving it to it you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to have a negative consequence
like I don't think anybody's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: complained about calcium toxicity you know
right for sure so uh data points you
[SPEAKER_01]: collect a lot of data points sounds like
you collect a bunch I know it's it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the topics that I keep going back to on
my shows with different people is like
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting data points whether you're
developing your palate or you're you know
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at what potential problems are or
how to improve your soil I think data
[SPEAKER_01]: points are everything you know in life in
life in general you want to improve data
[SPEAKER_00]: points are the way to do it well and think
about it from a business perspective too
[SPEAKER_00]: if you cannot sit down and say hey these
are the targets that we're reaching for
[SPEAKER_00]: this is you know the soil that I'm about
to give you this is what we you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to show them and say here's the
data here's how this thing functions and
[SPEAKER_00]: works as a whole and you can map it out
and you can replicate it over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again that's what people want to see so
they can have that assurance and
[SPEAKER_00]: competence that they're going to be able
to run a program that's data driven that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be replicable over and over
and over so they can not so much have to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on trying to address deficiencies or
try to figure stuff in the back end of
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow when they can be focusing more
on their brand and their marketing and
[SPEAKER_00]: their distribution and their taxes and
their you know metric if they have metric
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they're reporting all the stuff
that's included in these vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated business models so the you know
ideally that the the thing is to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead by using these types of systems
and a good example of this is if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: to take something like let's take a farm
I'm not going to mention the name out in
[SPEAKER_00]: New Mexico that I visited they had one
greenhouse that was 80,000 square feet
[SPEAKER_00]: okay and they were all running cocoa and
two gallon pots now at the end of their
[SPEAKER_00]: they were doing terrible by the way but at
the end of their run what they do is they
[SPEAKER_00]: cut all their plant matter they remove
that they remove all of the fertigation
[SPEAKER_00]: lines from their pots they take all those
pots they dump all of their cocoa in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pile someone would they pay to have that
cocoa removed from the facility and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd go wash all those buckets they go
refill them with cocoa they'd go reset
[SPEAKER_00]: them on the table hook up all the
fertigation lines right so that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amount of labor in a soil system
you would be cutting down the material
[SPEAKER_00]: removing it for drying and curing then you
would be going in there you would top dry
[SPEAKER_00]: you you would test your soil be
pre-harvest to get it to the lab because
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes five days for the lab analytics
to come back and then you can get a recipe
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically says what needs to be added
to that soil to bring it back up to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional sufficiency so basically what
you do is you harvest you top dress you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant back into that media and then you
run your program again and so you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: it's less labor intensive it's more cost
effective because you're not also using a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of uh fertigation salts like
synthetics that have really low nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: use efficiency only about 10 percent of
what you're putting in there actually is a
[SPEAKER_00]: is observed by the plant and that's why
you have to constantly feed over and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why there's so much waste now in
these types of systems you have better
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient use efficiency especially if
you're using something like the smart
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon humate fertilizers and you're and
you're using top dress nutrients because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're addressing carbon that holds on to
plant mineral ions and deliver them into
[SPEAKER_00]: solution and you can see how they're
delivering them into solution through the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and we're not just looking at ph and
ec and temperature but we can look at
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant mineral ion and adjust
it based off of what we add into that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of that top dress but it's just
less labor intensive it's more cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and so it's about you know
bringing down the production cost for
[SPEAKER_00]: people because look here's the thing dude
when we're talking about cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_00]: become an agricultural commodity
regardless of whether it's craft you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using it for medicinal or adult use it
doesn't really matter anymore because now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's become so commercialized and the only
way that the small guy is going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to take advantage of this is we're going
to be able to by decreasing their overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: just like us you know small sustainable
farms do how do we do that in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: well we need to start by reducing our
overhead reducing our inputs reducing our
[SPEAKER_00]: water usage our nutrient inputs reducing
our labor costs those are all things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all possible to do and scale with
these types of systems and it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: people to focus on the business side
because it's so difficult to to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: small business because there's so much
competition you have to have good
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and you have to have good sales
and distribution and then you also have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about all the back-end business
stuff i know as a business person you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that your accounting and your bookkeeping
and your taxes and your reporting and dude
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so important man right it's just
about making it easy dude simplifying it
[SPEAKER_01]: and making it easy yeah for sure yeah it's
not easy to run a business i mean i think
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabis isn't easy but your
business on top of that is like a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: nother thing because i feel like and it's
not typically you're not just you have one
[SPEAKER_01]: person they're not doing it all you got
you got several people you know we all in
[SPEAKER_01]: like my business we we all wear many hats
but there's still several people and we
[SPEAKER_01]: all work synergistically together and it's
it's not easy these days and the price of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has been low i think there's been
a lot of people struggling and so yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering the cost of your inputs being as
efficient as possible is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee you success for years to come if
you do it right yep and so that's you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been my main focus i work with a
lot of independent owner operators i work
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of people all over the country
but i work with a really great great group
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that i'm like close to because
they're local to me here in oklahoma and i
[SPEAKER_00]: even put together like this craft farmers
alliance where i'm just trying to help get
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the same room all together so
that way we can help with cross-bredding
[SPEAKER_00]: and marketing making sure people aren't
growing all the same stuff trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: compete for shelf space uh help with you
know education when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation and helping push back against
shitty legislation that they're always
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to push in cannabis which like
higher taxes more reporting uh you know
[SPEAKER_00]: more you know increased i could go on and
on for sure you know dude the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that basically kill businesses kill small
businesses you know and it's like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to and and you know and so the
thing the thing is and what i've learned
[SPEAKER_00]: because i'm right down the street from the
capital and i've worked out here with
[SPEAKER_00]: another guy jett green and he runs uh
oklahoma responsible cannabis action and
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been up to the capital several times
and the only people that are up there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are representing business
interests right and so there's no balance
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not anybody representing
independent independent business you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a bunch of independent people
that are in business up there because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all independently running their
own businesses right you know and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like they can't go in they can't go run a
business and be at the capital to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: lobby so that they can stay in business
and it's like this vicious fucking crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle that like it doesn't make sense that
the average american person would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially hire lobbyists just so small
independent operators can function in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country but that's exactly what's fucking
happening is the only fucking people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are up there talking to these legislators
are business interests lobbyists sure yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean there's minimal representation for
the small guy that's what we try to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to be able to collectively
represent and find people that'll that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: represent uh us as a group and not just
because look when you are a good operator
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're transparent with what you do
and you grow good product and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your skews lined up and you work with
people people will will come to you you
[SPEAKER_00]: can build a brand if you have if you're
consistent and people know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing to the table you can build a
brand sure and i see all the time but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard dude with all the regulations yeah i
mean i believe the one percent rule so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you know you're in that one percent
you're usually going to be doing good you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to strive for that you know that a
plus but you want to strive for that but
[SPEAKER_01]: you know any more you want to strive for
that point one percent to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: successful yeah so let's dive into a
conversation about cultivars and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking a little earlier before the
podcast started about uh you have ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: dialing in specific cultivars cultivar
specific nutrition so as you and i'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: all your listeners have experienced there
are a lot of different nuances with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional needs between cultivars a good
example of this is you know maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have some afghan dominant variety
that doesn't need as much nitrogen it
[SPEAKER_00]: requires drier climates doesn't require as
much humidity and you know so you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of seeing that it has some weird
things with calcium that's going on that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a good example of seeing things that i've
seen versus maybe something that's a more
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorial varietal it grows lengthier
longer intral nodal spacing narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant characteristics that kind of is
spindly and requires uh you know maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: shitload more calcium to nitrogen ratio to
keep them a little more stout because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that they you know kind of tend to
tend to grow so there's different nuances
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever those nuances may be cultivar
dependent they're usually environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: but also nutritional dependent these kind
of variances and so you know we mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that the different types of tests we have
what's called a standard soil test and
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives us just an overall view of
what's in the soil as a total percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're looking at on that we're looking
at our our four major soil cations which
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be calcium magnesium potassium
and sodium we want to see calcium around
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 percent magnesium 12 to 15 percent and
then for cannabis uh potassium we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see uh five to eight percent and then
sodium as low as possible it's
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonistic to all of those and the right
reason why we want to have those in those
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios is because if you have 60 percent
of the soil solution calcium uh 15 or 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 15 mag and five to eight of potassium
when you look at the ppm on how they fall
[SPEAKER_00]: into solution the parts per million of
that solution will be balanced and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see kind of what we're we're
looking for and so that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking on that we're also looking at the
amount of total micronutrients that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: that system overall and we're looking at
nitrogen levels and then when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the saturated paste we can see
how that soil falls into solution now if
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say everything meets you know where
it's supposed to be and we're meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: those targets we can also take a look at
um the the leaf tissue and the leaf tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: also has a target so nitrogen has a
percentage of the leaf that it should be
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium magnesium all the micronutrients
secondary nutrients all that and so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge that and if we have a target for a
cold of art and let's say it is uh between
[SPEAKER_00]: four and a half and five and a half
percent in the leaf tissue calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're meeting our target which is let's
say it's uh uh 200 ppm of calcium that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the the target of the parts per million
that we want to see on a saturated paste
[SPEAKER_00]: test because that's basically our nutrient
solution that the plant is going to see in
[SPEAKER_00]: this soil if we're seeing it that and it's
at 200 ppm but we're only seeing maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of calcium in the leaf we there's
a couple of things that we can that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: um analyze with that so one is calcium is
dependent on vpd so it's dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and transport of water through
the plant the reason is is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cannot translocate calcium from its
lower parts to newer growth to supplement
[SPEAKER_00]: for what it needs for new growth it needs
to be available in solution that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: such a high percentage of it percentage of
calcium needs to be in solution it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can have an abundance of calcium
in that in that leaf so that way we can
[SPEAKER_00]: have all the signaling molecules it's the
backbone of a lot of the lignin and
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose and all the other cellular
components when we're looking at that and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two ways that we can approach it
if we're not getting the the adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of calcium in the tissue but it's
meeting that range where it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be at 200 ppm then we have to look at the
environment because maybe our soil is too
[SPEAKER_00]: dry or our vpd is off and so we're not
getting adequate transpiration and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's responsible for calcium because
calcium moves in water right it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on water movement so if we don't
have transpiration taking place and water
[SPEAKER_00]: movement going through the plant the
calcium then calcium isn't going to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it needs to be we can look at we my
immediate would be oh we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at vpd because calcium is highly
dependent on vpd so if we're looking and
[SPEAKER_00]: all our vpd is in range it's right where
it should be then we know for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular nutrient we need to increase it
so we need to increase the the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration and the percentage of
calcium on the standard soil so we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase in the ppm maybe we go up to
225 ppm or 250 ppm these are really high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels by the way i don't recommend this
150 to 200 is usually max for calcium but
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say it is a variety that needs more
of it we could push it by doing that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we could take another tissue sample
and if we see okay we're now at that four
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half percent range by increasing the
available of the availability of calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: then we know that we've reached our target
goal okay so for this specific cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having 200 ppm of calcium we
need 250 ppm of calcium and so to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that i already know how much of what
element like it might be calcium silica it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be gypsum it might be oyster shell
it might be bone meal it just depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrition of the soil what i'll add to
bring it up to that target level for that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific variety and then there's another
part of it too so i can do that for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different elements if nitrogen is low
as a percentage and i 'm looking at it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be three percent it's only one percent
then i need then i know that i need to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the nitrogen levels for that for
that plant so it works really easy it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just numbers and it's like i already have
it all plugged in like it's it for me it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a lot of sense i don't know if i'm
explaining it well enough but um i can
[SPEAKER_00]: just adjust those levels and then what
we're doing is we're taking an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: test to to see what happens when we've
adjusted those levels and then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing what we can do is called sap
analysis and sap analysis is two different
[SPEAKER_00]: tests where you're testing fully developed
photosynthetic top leaves and fully
[SPEAKER_00]: developed uh photosynthetic sheer bottom
leaves and it gives a difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and it allows you to see how
mobile nutrients like magnesium potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen phosphorus how they move or if
they're being translocated before they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: ever show as a deficiency symptom so if
you see that like nitrogen is lower on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom than it is on the top then you know
that it's pulling from the lower to it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting enough in solution to satisfy
both the bottom portion and the top
[SPEAKER_00]: portion so the plant is actually pulling
nutrition it's catabolizing itself it's uh
[SPEAKER_00]: any stored amino acids or anything like
that will break those down release
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and phosphorus and it'll send
that up into the plant to where the new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth needs it right and so you can see
that with a sap analysis because it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: show which nutrients are being catabolized
at the bottom of the plant and being taken
[SPEAKER_00]: to the top and so if you're seeing that
nitrogen is lower at the bottom you can
[SPEAKER_00]: also increase your target on your uh on
your saturated pace test to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have an adequate amount of that target
nutrient so that way they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: level you want to see on on the both the
bottom and the top on a graph you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see and be level that means that it's not
pulling from the bottom if the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: graph is lower it means it's pulling from
the bottom part of the plant and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing you can look at one of those
tests before it will ever show a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency symptom and preemptively act
and so that's one of the benefits because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're addressing a nitrogen deficiency
or potassium or phosphorus deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: you're usually addressing it after it's
about 50 already into that deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom yeah before it's even observable
you can test get get a sap test and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to to see it yeah have you done
any sap testing no but i'm super
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in it sounds awesome okay so
new age labs it's kind of a complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: process i did it for the i did it for two
cultivars and i this is how i built out
[SPEAKER_00]: the the program because i i knew i could
do it and i wanted to test it out and so
[SPEAKER_00]: um the the process is really complicated
but you're basically taking three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: standard soil saturated paste leaf tissue
and sap tests during the span of one
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation cycle so from the beginning of
veg to the end of flower and so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting you're basically taking a data
set for a cultivar and you're mapping it
[SPEAKER_00]: out with all of this with all of the the
the um the data that you're collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: from each individual one of those tests
but new age labs what you'll do is you
[SPEAKER_00]: take like you go and take let's say you
have your greenhouse right and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: test this row that has all you know you've
sourced or diesel in it right sap you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take bottom from all the plant and you'll
categorize that as the bottom you'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: all the leaves from the top and you'll
take like i don't know 80 grams of each
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you bag them up i usually put
like paper towel so so that way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: seal the bag and not have a mold but you
ship them next day in a little ice chest
[SPEAKER_00]: container and then they'll then they'll
test them like within a day and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll give you an analysis so it's uh
it's not real time but it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty efficient one day is pretty good
yeah yeah it's really cool it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool the way they do it that's awesome and
and then logan labs is the lab that i use
[SPEAKER_00]: for all my testing that's uh there's you
know some really good books too there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: book called uh the art of balancing soil
nutrition he's by uh bill mckibben he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: corn and soil agronomist and he uses logan
labs and they have such great comp
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive data sets and being able to
start for anybody who's interested in this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff those that's what really great place
to start because you can look at different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of soil you can look at different
types of media and like when you would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have frequent low dose fertigation
events for different types of soil like in
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor soils or like nutrient or soils
that hold a lot of nutrition that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to fertilize a lot you know so
you can figure out all the different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of nuances in soil as well and you know
how those things will react with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other the other elements and like how
biology will work in those systems as well
[SPEAKER_00]: to help keep things in a form that's going
to be available for the plant really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: well let's talk about genetics a little
bit what you like what's uh what's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon i guess oklahoma is probably
different than california right now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like the the purple craze drives me nuts a
little bit but uh yeah that's the that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene in california and i feel like
there'll always be a place for gas which
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are which ones are real popular right
now where you're at well you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like i mean we're still on like the rs 11
you know we get the there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: but i think in yeah the those type of
things you get the zoaps the rs 11s the do
[SPEAKER_01]: farm stuff is definitely popular right now
and i mean there's lit farms is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses with them as well with the
permanent marker from jbz so like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: those permanent marker crosses are now
starting to hit the streets but same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the rs 11 crosses and the soap
crosses those are definitely hitting the
[SPEAKER_01]: streets from other people but i still feel
like we're gonna go back towards gas uh
[SPEAKER_01]: you know purple candy gas is what they
want now but i feel like the green gas
[SPEAKER_01]: will make its comeback the ogs the classic
ogs will always have their place on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market so there's a demand for sour diesel
but it's just not available nobody's and
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing is it's a long flowering
cultivar so it's a real sour diesel is is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the difficult one because of plant
maintenance and flowering time and along
[SPEAKER_00]: with that additional flowering time again
it's it comes with additional nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements too so it's it's just one of
those you know the sour diesel that was
[SPEAKER_00]: real prevalent around san diego was you
know about 84 days yeah if you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: uh if you wanted to do it right and i but
you know i feel like that profile like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one like that's sour because i was
smoking um i was smoking some sour dub out
[SPEAKER_00]: in la when i was out there last and it was
like oh this is this i was immediately had
[SPEAKER_00]: nostalgia because it was the like the what
we called the sour og down in san diego
[SPEAKER_00]: right headband sour og yeah for sure the
same it was the same it was the same
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar like it i knew it immediately
because it was so nostalgic and i had
[SPEAKER_00]: grown it for such a long time it was my
favorite for a really long time and so
[SPEAKER_00]: sours like that you know those i love
those i love the pk man that was a big one
[SPEAKER_00]: but i'm i'm not uh i'm not super picky
when it comes to like my cannabis like i
[SPEAKER_00]: love all different flavors i don't have
anything that i don't specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically like there's some things that
i'd like to see that i haven't seen in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time like um i haven't smoked
anything mentholated like i remember
[SPEAKER_00]: growing this variety called jaw rule i
think or jaw love or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: it smelled like sage like if you walk into
a room where it had been burnt somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: was smoking it it smelled like white sage
like distinctly it smelled like white sage
[SPEAKER_00]: and i remember that was one of the
characteristics of that specific variety
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you smoked it it was it was like
a heavy mentholated pine you know was it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't like smoky flavored it wasn't uh
didn't have like the sherb or you know it
[SPEAKER_00]: was it was really distinct it was a really
distinct flavor i haven't seen anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that really long time yeah not
incency but but a lot of stuff like we get
[SPEAKER_01]: menthol stuff occasionally but we call
most of the menthol like any of the i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know we go through so many different
things and we find some interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and like menthol it it depends on what
level of menthol like i can see it as
[SPEAKER_01]: negative but i know what you're talking
about as as something that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes amazing and kind of adds to
especially if you get some pine in there
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that i've been smoking right
right now is this fucking shit this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what everybody's wanting this is what i
mean don't get me wrong it's great fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: weed somebody just drop by that grows
organic soil too and they game is to me
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like that purple you know like or
jealousy it all has that it all has that
[SPEAKER_01]: chopped cookies uh cookies turps where
it's like very orange a little bit you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a little like a tangy in there but not
heavy yeah it's it's that uh that like
[SPEAKER_00]: that artificial kind of grapey that has a
little bit of like citrus in it i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: hate it i like smoking it but it seems
like a lot of stuff have that in it around
[SPEAKER_00]: here at least where we're at and so um i'd
rather just see i like you know i like
[SPEAKER_00]: garlics i like oh geez i like gas i love
jack i love jack i uh i got an ounce uh
[SPEAKER_00]: from my boy the other day not the other
day i actually smoked through it it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a month ago but my boy erin he
grows some just amazing old school jack
[SPEAKER_01]: dude and it's the really old school jack
was way better yeah i mean the stuff we
[SPEAKER_01]: see as jack in california is typically
very well i like j1 j1 and then j1 had a
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble gum i made the j1 bubble gum cross
a long time ago but uh j j1 i i think is
[SPEAKER_01]: great uh this the jack flash is great the
classic jack that was more of like musky
[SPEAKER_01]: and very complex compared to like the very
lemony terpenine limonene jack that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: very linear i don't like that but i like
the old jacks yeah because the old jack
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got this peppery incense along with
this kind of really earthy musk even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it does have that that lemon and
pine in there it's it's mixed really well
[SPEAKER_00]: with that type of peppery incense and that
that that overall musk and so i don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is but the stuff gets me high and
this stuff this stuff doesn't doesn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: just doesn't do it and it's purple it's
all purple weed you know it's all purple i
[SPEAKER_00]: like purple weed nothing against purple
weed um it's just i think that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: sells man i think that's what people have
always loved purple weed and it is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is i think that you just kind of have to
grow what your market demand is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and that's going to change over time
i mean it's stuff is like popular for two
[SPEAKER_01]: months and then it's on to something new
and it seems like it's it's popular but
[SPEAKER_01]: that eventually is going to stabilize
because i mean even with all these purple
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars in these different profiles
they're not all that different so
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually the market is going to
stabilize a lot more people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go with stuff they like i mean yeah we
like trying new stuff but like i i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see it as being this way in five years i
think it's going to you know people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have their one flavor that
they're known for their five flavors that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're known for and that's that's what i
preach because i tell i tell people all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time like i don't advocate for like
hat like i don't want deli style taken
[SPEAKER_00]: away i don't want legislation taken away i
want people to be able to still have that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of experience but i tell people that
the consumer is visually driven and so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a skew and a package and things
you know a label and everything else and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's consistent in the product inside it's
going to build brand recognition and and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you know i've always told
people when i'm talking about you know
[SPEAKER_00]: building out a brand is you know the the
large percent of the consumer market isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really highly educated on the products
that they're consuming so if you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that's highly related to them
like having something like blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody understands blueberry or they
understand root beer or they understand
[SPEAKER_00]: watermelon blast you know it doesn't like
if you can if you can kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that matches the description of
what you're giving them and make it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of general i think that's why so many of
the the candy brands and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: have worked so well is because they're
relatable to the general public and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily need to have a lot of
hype i think it just needs to be relatable
[SPEAKER_00]: to to people who who are interested
because i've been smoking for a long ass
[SPEAKER_00]: time but i forget there's there's new
consumers daily another thing too is i see
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of success working with like the
craft farmers alliance when we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: working together we're not all growing the
same thing not everybody's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent marker right now not everybody's
growing rainbow shirt not everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing you know mac one every you know
like red dirt will be growing his meat and
[SPEAKER_00]: jam and his papaya and then banana seed
bananicals is going to be doing her lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry gelato and her form cookie cut
crosses and then 4h farms is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: running you know something different you
know completely different and so it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like keeping a community network
together that can help facilitate skews
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like okay these are their skews
for these for these people so we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: all fucking growing the same thing
