Music
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Ladd podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guest is Pat King.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the soil king.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a gonjie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's building multiple brands,
including Rosentech and a bunch of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of respect for this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad to have you on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, you know, I mean,
I'm on the number one podcast of the year
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where would I not want to be
watching James Loud and where I come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is where I started
growing weed out of the young kid right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the Rosentech thing, I'm just a
partner with Sam and a partner that Sam's
[SPEAKER_01]: grinding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm building these other businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my homie right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us about Soil King, because I hear
Soil King, Soil King, Soil King from all
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this confusion of King's mix
and Soil King.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wait, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a laughable story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Royal Gold are all their friends
of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I love the whole crew, you know,
the owner, my friend, all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used to go up to spare time
supply and do a horseshoe tournament
[SPEAKER_01]: contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Soil King team was just wiping the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year we finally we lost finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was an inside joke was the Soil
King.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was like, screw you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to come out with the King's
mix, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing you know, here it showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if it was anybody else,
you know, I'd be, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of room in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it felt good having, you know,
it was a good move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was definitely a good move.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and they're definitely a company that
I ride shoulder to shoulder with,
[SPEAKER_01]: no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love those guys, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a good group of community,
especially Humboldt, Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the Emerald Triangle and the
ones that are left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just, you know, we all smile at
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting not to get off subject,
but I'm driving through coming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I, you know, this is where
the 13 year old boy within right here was
[SPEAKER_01]: coined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was growing weed in Niles
Canyon, Wybel Winery, Mill Creek Road by
[SPEAKER_01]: Ohlone College at nine, 10, 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was arrested in Fremont for the first
time and handcuffs were growing weed in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pine tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been my stomping grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was homeless as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm built by my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I'm not ashamed of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I'm totally built by by
all that in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so coming back here and just kind of
reminiscing and seeing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I started from was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this little whole strip downtown right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like we're a step away from
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit safer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Oakland's a little crazy right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into your history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you fall in love with the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living in Fremont, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't have a lot of
discipline in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had really no discipline in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hung out with the older crew,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a stoner crew back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love me as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were my people that,
you know, took me under their wing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my my first memory is hands in the
soil growing strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my I've been cultivating everything
since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why my biggest thing is there's no
segregation in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say it for the back of the room back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no segregation in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a botanical just like anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, botanical save lives this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, they segregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This and make it a higher commodity and
more taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bunch of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting back to my hands in the soil
as a kid, it was about nine years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, nine years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started smoking weed because it was
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out with the older crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember one day I was probably
nine, nine years old and they'd have a
[SPEAKER_01]: zigzags were around back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 56 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the 80s, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 70s actually going into the 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: 99 something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're the Columbia weed was also
everything was seeded back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody complained about seeded weed back
then because there was no such thing as
[SPEAKER_01]: non seeded weed back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, you know, we'd break it up and
break weed or whatever it is on an album
[SPEAKER_01]: cover like a Led Zeppelin album cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and this and then you you tilt
the album cover and you let the you take
[SPEAKER_01]: the zigzag card and you hit it and all the
seeds would drop on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, you know, I was a little
entrepreneur back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking these fools are paying
money for lids, four finger lid back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I'm like, I can grow fucking
anything already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where it all coined it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing you know, I was growing weed
and I was selling it to everybody and had
[SPEAKER_01]: my own four finger lids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's where it coined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was 11 years old growing weed in a
pine tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the neighbor saw me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured if anybody's going to see weed
out, you know, in a field, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see me walking out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a kid back then, there was no like
Nintendo and video games.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did forts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We climbed trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we did every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I figured if I'm up on a platform,
people would just think it's a fort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of built it all set up like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighbor, I was watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take, you know, milk jugs and stuff and
pull them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was watering and the water was going
through, hitting the ground and making
[SPEAKER_01]: noise and a neighbor a little ways away.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking at me and fuck, it was four
or 45 minutes later, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cops were there throwing handcuffs on
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was one of my first stint
doing time for this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next time was one year later,
same tree, same mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I learned the outlaw shit
from that point on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't you got to diversify.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switch it up a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insanity is repeating the same thing over
and over, expecting different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where it started for me,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think there's something to be
said for the seeds that came out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed back then, like the Mexican,
the Colombian, wherever else we were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it from, you know, Acapulco,
you know, all these different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the genetics were actually good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just weren't grown to the best of
their ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grew them with very little inputs
and they, they mashed them all up and they
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed them and made them look ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the genetics were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could pop the seeds like you were
doing and actually get really good
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, back then it was Afghanistan
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Columbia gold, obviously,
Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I still have seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's a project we can work on
together because I can't bring them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, my brother Bill, Bill Rogers,
not blood brother, but he, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we raised each other together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an Iowa now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ma, his mother passed away about 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, as I went to the funeral,
I came out and he comes down from upstairs
[SPEAKER_01]: and he says, I've been keeping this for
you this whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I remember Jack Daniels used
to have a tin where he opened it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Jack Daniel bottle was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that tin was like the most special
thing ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's our stash boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and he comes down and he goes,
you can have this, but I'm keeping the
[SPEAKER_01]: tin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I opened it up and there's all of
my seeds from a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, and there's all these notes
and I'll show, I'll, I'll bring all these
[SPEAKER_01]: out, send you pictures of them,
all these notes, super skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even have notes of like extra seed
because I didn't, when I was cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: back then, I didn't know nobody,
there's nothing to read about male and
[SPEAKER_01]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really a female plant was always
pollinated with some seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I remember growing up Mill Creek
road on the side of a mountain,
[SPEAKER_01]: just crushing it and berries and oak
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing you know, I see these
plants and they're male plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never seen a male plant before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this thing is no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the evolution of,
of understanding the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point, it's pretty interesting
being a young kid trying to figure that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And discovering all these new things,
you know, and it's, when you have somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you about how to do stuff,
it's so much different than learning stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as accessibility to knowledge,
it's amazing what's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now we have the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of people we're,
we're able to talk about it freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you couldn't talk about it,
it was like, if you did, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get arrested for talking about
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no access to knowledge other
than me saying, you know, I'm a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I had a hard upbringing and I
didn't really have much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was homeless as a, as a kid as well
too, living on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had to hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a born fucking hustler when it comes
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I saw the opportunity,
I seized the moment and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I made money my whole life off cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I really didn't is when I
got out of San Quentin and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody told me that cannabis was a
gateway drug back into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a recovered addict and, and that would
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I raised my kids and I, you know,
for a decade, I didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit because I was afraid of,
of really fucking up my life or fucking up
[SPEAKER_01]: the kid's life that I brought into this
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I come to find out I'm green and
sober today, super proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant is my medicinal side of
recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, not pharmacy, not the
pharmaceuticals they throw down your
[SPEAKER_01]: throat for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm green and sober and proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I cut out alcohol the last
month and I feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got some guys that we follow
along on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I followed their podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been cleaning us over for years
and it's, it's, it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a social thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not easy to break that trend,
but when you're not going out and hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out with everybody all the time,
it's also a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally easier, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, you go into a barbershop,
you get a fucking haircut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go hang out with the boys in the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting drunk, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You hate, you, you know, you want to have
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you weren't the type of individual you
were building stuff like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you hang around those type of people
that can lift you up in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is there the saying that if you hang
out with five smart people, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the sixth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hang out with five stupid
people, you're probably the sixth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's a, you're the average
of, there's the other one that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the average of your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In business for me, you know, I have my
mentor, Dr. Greg Reed, who's a million,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's called the millionaire mentor and
lives in San Diego and has a secret knock
[SPEAKER_01]: and do a bunch of cool stuff with a lot of
cool people, but it's an entrepreneurial,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, business mindset group of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've all hit the wall, seen hell,
you know, rebuild back up, bankrupt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and here they are sitting at top
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the message I got, and I really hone
into it and building up the businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: again, after my collapse is, is everybody
I put at the table has to be smarter than
[SPEAKER_01]: me in a category, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can't, I can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't even lie to myself and say,
I can, like, I'm good at my shit and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're speaking my words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm good at what I'm good at,
but I work with the people that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: best at what they're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together we have the best team.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you build businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you build things that last.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you build things that are
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sam and I, we, you know,
we experienced a lot of, a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first met Sam, my partner from
Rosenthal, he's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that I'd be impressed when I came
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't lay me down on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just talking about the structure
and the hardcore business, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, Sam's hated me at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've hated Sam at times and I love Sam and
he loves me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the relationship at the
end of the day, this industry destroys
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody had the right assets or,
or, you know, roadmap for success because
[SPEAKER_01]: it never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no successful roadmap.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be had.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, you put it all in,
you live for passion and you, you cross
[SPEAKER_01]: your fingers and we just happen to be a
couple of dudes that are still standing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to understand how to pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the other thing that like,
when something's not working there,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's ways to pivot, uh, and also double
down on what you're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're good at something,
keep doubling down on that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, and Sam's,
Sam's good at business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the dabba doo together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the event with, for Mila and,
uh, yeah, I mean, Sam, we ran it really
[SPEAKER_00]: well, uh, you know, for such short notice,
Sam came and saved me for the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking forward to doing another
one this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I just, it's great working
with people like Sam who were very
[SPEAKER_00]: organized, but also as a team player in
the sense that he knows how to manage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he has guys, his right-hand man is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like these guys crush Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we learned that those are,
those are, those are hogger hard knock,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, things, situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you learn, again, we started this
conversation at bettering the table with
[SPEAKER_01]: better individuals, you know, in areas
that you fall short on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam and me, you know, we went through
complete hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, we looked at
each other and said, well, we can do this
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, everybody's at our throats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's trying to sue us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can fight this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, let's fucking go,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and him shoulder and shoulder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that point on, we realized no
matter what we're a solid team in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of things coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I turn around and I'm scared or
not feeling it, or don't know how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: through something, I can call Sam,
Sam, same with me and say, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, this is, this is some, you know,
untouched waters right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is what I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sam's like, man, you got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what we've been through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look where we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing with me and him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I call him, I'm like,
bro, you know, I'm proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm straight proud of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you made it through that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last jungle with the, with a lawsuit
on the puffco situation, man, I'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: balls deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother, Sam, he, he saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He never gave up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would say he out, he outplayed
the table too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he totally outplayed it and he
deserved it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting with business and there
not being any sort of playbook and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: making it up as you go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, it's, it's one of
those things that like, you, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in yourself so much, even when
other people don't believe in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you believe in it, that's what
really counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in an amazing time in the
industry because we have had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends fail and we have had a lot of
friends suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, before it was people were
going to prison for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government was now they're being,
you know, taken out of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't afford to be in the
industry because there's no profit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, especially on the cultivation
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best cultivators out there are
struggling because I would love to see
[SPEAKER_00]: them be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm not a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love growing and I think it's amazing,
but I also see that I can work with
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can work with the best cultivators out
there and I can really focus on genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil and producing the best and
solventless and the picks and shovel side
[SPEAKER_01]: of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still own the cannabis side of it
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm really diversified in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like you said, man, I think,
I think in Mendocino County back before
[SPEAKER_01]: prop 64, there's over 11,000 farmers and
application to become licensed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got duped.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, we got totally taken advantage of,
you know, what are we at now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we lost and that's just licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not unlicensed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole Emerald triangle was built off
unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look at the generational farmers
and the family of people that I grabbed
[SPEAKER_01]: the belt loop that taught me, you know,
everything are no longer around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about very devotional
farmers that believed in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that believed in what they did and also
grew really good flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's the sad part is when
they grow everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for everything, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember going up North and you know,
like, like area one to one, or we have
[SPEAKER_01]: these, everything was a barter trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, there's people sell a trade in leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that got raw milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's eggs, there's veggies,
there's cannabis, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pottery, there's edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just an everybody's in everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all barter trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got this next thing, you know,
we're walking out of there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys should be, and that's how it
should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these farmers in the mountains,
they, they did everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they didn't just grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they cultured their entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have to leave the mountain
because there was, you know, their
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability was the key for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they built a quality community around
what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, uh, it was inclusive
and exclusive at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you had to watch your back for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had to be the gatekeeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said of a great quote that I stole
and I didn't hear it directly from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard it from a guy named OG Steve,
who's one of my good friends, but when he
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to your, uh, farm to pick up
some soil years ago, he said, Pat,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get a big discount on this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said, Steve, I really like you,
but I like me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is maybe one of the best quotes
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually used that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's, it's funny, but you
know, it's like, it's a great quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is because we have to survive,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when my numbers of soil, I,
my inputs are so expensive because I
[SPEAKER_01]: source everything at the highest level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to that, I don't have a
whole lot of margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see me living fucking,
you know, I'm like, I'm trying to take
[SPEAKER_01]: care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a farmer taking care of farmers at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and you pride yourself in quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally with quality, quality and
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistency is super important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just as important as quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause what does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you have one good batch and one
bad batch, same thing with flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing with everything in the
industry, whether it's seeds, soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of inputs, it's all about
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, if I get a, if I get truckload
of castings in, if I get whatever it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming in, I, I test everything
before I make a design, mix design.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you understand testing are
costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend just in labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs a lot of money, you know,
in more and more every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dollars worth less, all this stuff
costs us more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, who suffers is, you know,
the, the industry as a whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ain't got passion, you know,
you ain't got purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not a seat at this table left
anymore for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you're here for money,
you know, you brand, I teach branding and
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest thing I teach is you brand
yourself and you build yourself now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's worried about getting paid
to build the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to make money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil King was built a decade before I made
any money.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money didn't start rolling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put million dollars into the brand in
order to be where I'm at today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just, that's just facts,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the other part of marketing and
branding, I really like to hammer home and
[SPEAKER_01]: educate is brand yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem out here is we have all these
like corporate companies and different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, you know, and they have all
these influencers that work for them and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just marketing the brand they work
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they realize they don't have a
job and the brand never gave a fuck about
[SPEAKER_01]: them in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you're going to brand your
corporate, get a brand for yourself and
[SPEAKER_01]: collab, man, build yourself on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that one falls off, you're still
elevated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branding is so huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people see people
that they look up to in the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: all they see is the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see the struggles that you went
through going to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you know, then they see the
Soil King as somebody they see James Loud
[SPEAKER_00]: as this guy who's doing this podcast and
all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've been doing this since 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking weed since 91 growing
since the mid nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here because of all the steps that
got me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so many things and working on the
shoulders of giants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rest in peace Sam Skunkman passed away
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, guys like Sam, who really had
impact on on all the breeders out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you know it or not, Sam had big
influence and big impact on the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like we're all working
on the shoulders of so many giants that
[SPEAKER_00]: came before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that went to prison, you know,
it's it's legal to a degree right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not federally legal yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis has been going in the
direction of legality because there were
[SPEAKER_00]: outlaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying criminals were saying
outlaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're outlaws to pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's where I coined that,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just love it because I'm a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're you're talking about being
in the industry since beginning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pioneered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pioneered this to where it's at today,
even though you grab the belt loop of
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else that brought you in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how this thing works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The baton has been passed to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been passed to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're coming up to this new
generation where we used to go to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can go to 10 years in
federal prison for a couple of seeds like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends that went to jail for
seeds, went to for clones and went to
[SPEAKER_00]: prison for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like in Texas going to
prison for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're federally legal,
considered hemp by the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ship seeds to any state anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can they can be used for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used for whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in I was at Organic Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking, speaking engagement outside of
Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was sitting at a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to say names, but it was in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was one guy who's,
you know, I don't really rub the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, you know, I'm not knocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's complaining about how he's saying
how these fucking cannabis people can
[SPEAKER_01]: charge $10 a seed is out of my fucking
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, you know, bags and buckets of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's talking about, you know,
tomato seeds, watermelon seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's bitching and complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, motherfucker, you don't go to
prison for a watermelon seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 10 bucks can give you 10 fucking
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't think that that seed is worth
10 bucks where these breeders have really
[SPEAKER_01]: come from, you're crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave everything for this culture and
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten bucks, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on, that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's elevated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are seeds everywhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's you know, that's that's our
culture and where it comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to remind people that,
yeah, man, 10 bucks ain't shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do 10 years over 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, clones, $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what can it make you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that if you're spending $10 on a seed,
it has the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With seeds, it's a lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But $10 a seed is not even that much
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think of what happens if you get
lucky and you find that next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've since found other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their blood orange and Crockett
DNA have their blood orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that purple tangy was something
special back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tells you the one off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we always talk about F1s are
going all the way down to stabilize,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stabilizing the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I always say, you know,
I get a lot of flack on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it's super important that
breeders it's it's like, I don't walk onto
[SPEAKER_01]: a construction site never wearing a tool
bag or be an electrician and call myself a
[SPEAKER_01]: journeyman electrician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this this entitlement of a lot of our
industry now is, you know, you started
[SPEAKER_01]: messing with some pollen thrown on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually taking that name away from
people who gave their life, went to
[SPEAKER_01]: prison, who put who built this whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the term seed producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, OK, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you breeding to stabilize stuff or you
just making seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with nothing
wrong at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I think breeder is used very
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, who am I to judge on on
some level?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I feel like a good
term if you want to call yourself somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who's making seeds, unless you're actually
doing the work because the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: actually isn't making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is actually doing selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picking those selections is how I look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of guys are like big and call
themselves breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they do is take this plus this and
they make this and they're the next big
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I try not to judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to get over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting older right now, so I don't
get upset over shit that doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not knocking that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the purple tangy was a one off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we need we need the people
that are, you know, placing pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll call it, you know, and doing
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cool to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a there's a separation of guys
that, you know, I don't call myself a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I and I have M80, M1000, mama's
cheese, about 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one mama's mama's boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've once and I don't call myself and
I used to pop eleven hundred seeds of one
[SPEAKER_01]: variety at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I end up with, you know, four,
maybe six females and two good structures
[SPEAKER_01]: of a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd start trying to learn how to
stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't call myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think in the Emerald Triangle,
especially, you know, in other places,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, but in the Emerald Triangle,
in the 70s, 80s, early 90s, maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the 2000s, a lot of people got
their next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the seeds they made that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were really breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't call themselves breeders a
lot, but they did make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what got us to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that work we've piggybacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we have all these new
modern day cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the work was done previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're just seeing the expressions
today of all this stuff and very minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: work has gone in to get it to the point
where it's at now compared to 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis was really good back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people don't understand when
you tell them it was good, even the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early 90s, like we saw amazing
stuff and amazing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was more amazing outdoor then
than there is now on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many more people are going indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like a good outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a really good outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like good indoor, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that really sticky where you
take a bud and you stick it to the side of
[SPEAKER_00]: a glass, a piece of glass, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side of the bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's something to be said,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my I like my oranges kissed by the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my cannabis kissed by the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even my depths were retractable,
clear and black.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I wanted that during the day,
kissed by the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plastic, clear plastic is a UV
blocker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that ultraviolet rays doesn't ever
touch it with a UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why they add that,
otherwise that plastic would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: shred up in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last five or six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it changes the spectrum for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just like cocoa versus soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get different if you get a different
effect, different flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's funny because they're
doing all these studies on flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorants and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was just reading how
flavonoids actually change the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not related to the flavor in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, the color of the plant has
more to do with the flavonoids than
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Casey Canifest on 420, 418 and 19 in
Kansas City, Missouri.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hosting an emcee in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Soil King Legends, a legacy panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking Swami and Nicky out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Swami is one of his panels of
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's really educated me on some
things in the last, I'd say, year,
[SPEAKER_01]: year and a half on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so awesome to watch our culture
be educated and understand and taking next
[SPEAKER_01]: leaps, you know, in levels, because it
just keeps as soon as we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were talking turbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about terpenes,
terpenes, terpenes, and then abstract tech
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out with these white papers that are
like, well, hey, let's look at flavorants
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of the sulfur based compounds
that have to do with smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now we're in a different conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about thiols before a
little bit, but they're really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of a sudden, we're able to
measure these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right when we think we have it all figured
out, like with HPS lights, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights come out and they suck in the
beginning, but then they're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we live in an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're just still scratching the
surface of so many things that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be stabilized in the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the living soil and the soil and
manipulating minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do I do a this is really
fascinating shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a micro green mix and I work with a
couple micro greener greener producers
[SPEAKER_01]: that produce organic to grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But out in Texas, I work with one out
there zero point organics and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulating with minerals on flavors to
five star restaurants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't realize that you can
take, you know, something that's only
[SPEAKER_00]: alive for so long and you can change the
flavor of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for you guys that don't
understand, like with micro greens,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing micro greens or sprouts,
basically what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them in a flat like the ones you
guys root your clones in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're basically taking whatever
substrate you use and you're putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven to 10 to 14 days later, you're
cutting sometimes a little bit longer for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things, but sometimes a little
shorter for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can manipulate the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like to a lot, a big degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have five star chefs coming in and
they're saying, hey, can you turn this up
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you know, can you can you get this
radish a little hotter at the end and not
[SPEAKER_01]: so hot in the front?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are things you don't really are
just like next level stuff to me in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last couple of years that are super
exciting that play a part in all
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It plays a part in all cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end, can you manipulate the
flavor of, of a terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just getting to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have special broccoli for
people that have cancer, the broccoli
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a special seed that
they've, they've discovered that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: has higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the chemical compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show it on the screen, but yeah,
it's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody that grows cannabis
should be growing sprouts too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think any sort of sprouts,
their sprouts, microgreens, they're super
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them on pretty much
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them in my truck right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got yellow or a yellow pea sprouts,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I eat those all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other part was fascinating
learning is the nutrients, the density of
[SPEAKER_01]: the density of nutrients in a micro green,
let's say a broccoli versus you eating a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed sprout versus a head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting the same benefits from that
seed sprout as you are the entire head of
[SPEAKER_01]: the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing I just learned is it
isn't the nutrients that grows in the
[SPEAKER_01]: broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the store nutrients that's in the
seed to get it to life and to get it out
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole, you know, so,
and that's why it's so concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's so concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you got to take care of
your seeds, all seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're growing them, you're popping
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so important to grow
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the growing organic with
organic inputs, for seed production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there's, there's arguments
to be said for all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people think seed
production should be done outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer doing it inside so I can control
all the variables, prevent cross
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination from other pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're at that level right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just walking through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's crazy with production with
seeds with me, it was, I wanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: I cracked everything outside into
greenhouses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 32 foot wide by 120 foot
greenhouse with high ceilings and I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: everything out and phenohunted,
jacked them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I phenohunted and got
everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just clipping them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, I had, you know,
200 teenagers that I've sourced all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way down to adding in their full,
their full growing and plants getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to start flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were just taking the best dusting a
little pollen on the ones that you thought
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then out of that, then I would
take those, I'd find the structure of the
[SPEAKER_01]: males that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd take the females that I
really liked and the expression outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: is totally different than indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a plant early morning versus midday
versus evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those play a part in, in,
in sourcing and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the best cultivars that you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd go into the breeding project
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I had the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I had the females and then I'd start
doing my flavors and that's kind of all
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, M 80 and my M 1000s or
trying to pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember pulling tie out of AK 47 and
that was a cool project, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really getting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that was even before,
you know, I wish I still had that because
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet that would be really good ice water
hash producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Simon from serious seeds for
doing the work on the AK 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of Simon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done amazing work and really went
back to how breathing should be done with
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating stuff, creating F ones and
hybridizing those and creating all his
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like that, that guy bred
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when a guy calls himself a
breeder, even me, because I've done it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still a, I would say, what do you call
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Journeyman plumber?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a on my way up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, whatever novice or Amber
or whatever it is, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you look at him and those guys deserve
that title.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever that is, that plaque goes with
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes with dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon made five different things in five
years originally, you know, it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali mist, the AK 47, I'm missing the
other good ones, but there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: his, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he basically five strains, five years,
really impressive, took and put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: effort and took the time to do it
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think made huge impacts
on, on the world we live in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys like me, I mean, I make a lot of
out-crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do 300 plus out-crosses a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so, and then besides that
with the auto flower varieties and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing inbreeding with those and there's so
much work that goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so beyond me these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the skills are so, it can go as
deep as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start involving testing,
you know, and then it just starts getting
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts cutting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AK was a, so my M 80 is a GDP times
AK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and when that, when I popped out,
it was the most beautiful purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow and orange haired, you know,
and then I started, and then I started
[SPEAKER_01]: working on stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I didn't have anybody teach me this
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just hearing things back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mendo perp was AK times AK was my
M 1000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was these black hand grenade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were just hand grenade,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Black with yellow and, and orange hairs
popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo was wild back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going to pick up some Mendo
purse with my buddy Steve and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: driving and we had to go to a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is before cell phones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we had pagers back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically we had to go to this parking
lot and the guy would shine a light and we
[SPEAKER_00]: had to get out of the car, walk towards
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd come behind us and then we'd do the
exchange or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like, you know, or 94,
93, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendo perps, I don't know what was
Mendo perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a fucking clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still ask that question today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, there has been a,
I think almost, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's answers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, I just don't know what I
do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not gotten a good answer from
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you that answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's the funny thing is it's not
GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not any of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was the purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was also several, probably
different iterations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of people called Mendo
perp, Mendo perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of varietals of Mendo
perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even know originally,
you know, where my Mendo perp came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that it had great bag appeal
and was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the nineties, it was still top,
top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when outdoor was more expensive
than indoor at certain times of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we were just reminiscing not long ago
about the price points and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: USVI sending a few pounds at a time,
7,500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was, that was hitting up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember it was in the, in the
almost mid 2000s, early 2000s getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I remember when it would drop to
like 3,800 bucks a pound for indoor and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I was like, I'll never fucking do
this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, we realized how much, how wealthy I
was, you know, cause I was back then I was
[SPEAKER_01]: young dumb burning through so much cash,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shoe boxes of Benjamin's was like come
and go constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like, we never went
without.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think when you're at a young
age and you get money so quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't understand the value of a
dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of in the same boat and you
don't appreciate what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it only takes, one time losing it to
start appreciating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that then, you know,
you lose it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost my money several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I've made money, made good money and
then lost it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all good learning experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the value of a dollar now,
but I'm also 47, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would have been much nicer had I
been, you know, 20 and put a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, these things, it's like,
it's, it's life and that's what life's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's been a beautiful journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit comes and goes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long, strange trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about a soil king and where
that started, how you evolved from growing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything into starting a soil business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in, it was 08 housing turn,
you know, when, when that crashed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was builder developer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've been, I've been a millionaire
multiple times in my life and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 08 downturn, it was, it was grow
food, grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as that started
happening, I was like, I think my John
[SPEAKER_01]: Jennings, a good friend of mine,
he says he coined me the soil king.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what I was 20,
2007, I think is something like that is
[SPEAKER_01]: when it was soil king 2006, seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really passionate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started a mix line called Marley mix at
Marley moonshine, Marley Shroom Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, you know, it was a good,
it was a good mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was sourcing everything through
municipality green waste of dump sites.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, and that was before I really had
an understanding of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: glyphosates, pesticides, herbicides,
you know, all this avid, all this shit
[SPEAKER_01]: that was just so toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started unraveling that onion,
I immediately just like said, my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is, this is my calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was back then I, I got rid of those
lines and I'm like, I can't, I can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta, I gotta scrap all this and start
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started designing big root soil
being, you know, super tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tested back then for GMO, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The testing I did pre prop 64 and period
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the point where I got hated by a
lot of people in the Emerald triangle,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, because I owned a garden center.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a pet peeve in the
industry through the two 15 movement where
[SPEAKER_01]: we all got rich on, you know, we can grow
90 up to 99 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had seven patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 99, that was like the limit with
everybody scripts all over, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm living in the mountains and I'm,
and I'm doing all this, but I wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing fully organic and I
conscious cultivating and I wasn't using
[SPEAKER_01]: avid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, everybody was using all
this stuff and I had a garden center where
[SPEAKER_01]: people coming in mad because they can't
buy this shit from me avid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the two 15 movement,
it's a medical movement, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing medicinal plants and people
are putting things that are carcinogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: that are killing you in the name of
medicine on the plant to take down the bug
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was insane how much people were
putting of this shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you got to put a whole suit on and
you're spraying your plants and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, logic and common sense says you're
a fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the two 15 movement was about
making money in the name of Edison and
[SPEAKER_01]: killing people in the name of medicine
instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of, for me, I was,
I was coming through that era and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: preaching this, you know, you guys are
fucking stupid for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I was getting hated because it
was just plain ignorance, but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: how smoking was so accepted in the forties
and fifties and sixties, smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes, smoking on airplanes,
smoking indoors, all that shit and how bad
[SPEAKER_00]: it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very comparable to all the avid Eagle
20, all that shit that they used to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the trifectas that they used to combine to
spray on their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were basically poisoning people,
not knowing it with most, most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people actually had good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't understand that they were
poisoning their customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when they found a guy like me,
they realized it real quick as I was
[SPEAKER_01]: calling them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of the downfall was,
uh, you know, I was testing this when
[SPEAKER_01]: testing was coming online, SC labs,
I was trying to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had, what was the names out of steep
hill labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, then, then, yeah, there was the
steep hill and there was what's her name
[SPEAKER_01]: in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her and her husband had her lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I'm, I'm testing for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm producing, I'm at the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm producing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're squishing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're squishing flour back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of where we started, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to, went from, went from SIF to ice
water hash and trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: squishing flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrating pesticides, you know,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's concentrating pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was in Northern, I was at the
Emerald cup and I was showing testing of
[SPEAKER_01]: no pesticide levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to get into this and really
no lab was really accurate, but we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a lot of people that were angry
because they said I was trying to one up
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry by saying this, my shit's
better because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of knowledge that just
kind of rejected that look because we were
[SPEAKER_01]: making fucking money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, we were getting paid money
per unit and we're growing fucking units,
[SPEAKER_01]: like crashing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to get to the finish line,
it's easy to suit up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and throw some pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so many people don't ship it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so early on my mentor and someone who
I really believed in was my aunt and she's
[SPEAKER_00]: been preaching organics since 91,
since I first started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she always talks about organics,
you know, from, I'm sure from back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies, even talking about organics and
growing your own and doing it right and
[SPEAKER_00]: staying away from all the dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of people like that,
that were out there that did, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle was full of generational
family farms that are no longer in
[SPEAKER_01]: existence, but it was like the organic,
you know, they didn't go to the grocery,
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't go to the hydro store,
the garden centers for stuff, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they needed something, they made it
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it came off the farm, you know,
and it was a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organics was always there and I could
tap into the Swammies and Nickies of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get into that, but there was just
so much money being made, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that, so I don't know, not to keep
going down that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we transitioned into the Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the first, you know, see the soul up
in Cloverdale, California was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: micro license, if not the very first,
which I'm pretty sure it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the top one or two that was
given in the state of California when
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I prepared my city for Prop 64 to be
accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were the first city in the state of
California when Prop 64 was approved to
[SPEAKER_01]: allow licensing to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that process to me was huge because I
had to, I had to, you know, years prior,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to educate my community and educate
the council.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had, there was a four out of
five no vote forever, didn't want anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept showing up at the podium.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few people in Cloverdale would come in,
you know, Dorian would, would support it
[SPEAKER_01]: and going back from before to get the
city, you know, ready to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody said, no, the city council said,
well, this isn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city or the city manager came to
me and said, look, here's, here's the
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you can get your constituents
in the city to approve props, approve
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization of cannabis, we can have your
back, but we don't believe that's where it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, good, I'll put proposition P
on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put proposition P on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got over half of our city that approved
cannabis and wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in and said, well, we're moving
forward on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're putting money where you're
mouth is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did, we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with a city was completely in and
prepared and, and just take one step
[SPEAKER_01]: before that was building bridges with law
enforcement, chief of police of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of Cloverdale, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He died from cancer, eight rounds of
cancer from the walkie talkie on his neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came to me, I got arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got arrested for cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I had the garden center open and
I'm a, I'm on the boys and I'm on the boys
[SPEAKER_01]: and girls club on the board of directors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a long time lions club member.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a coach and literally, you know,
softball and doing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm building houses in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I am, uh, this cannabis guy
getting arrested for cannabis as a garden
[SPEAKER_01]: center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nothing really made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he came to me and said, came to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember he came to me and said,
look, man, why are you so passionate about
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, because this is going to save
lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, this is my passion and my purpose
and I'll never give up on the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just cannabis, but all across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will put everything at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, you know, my, my kids were coming
home crying, saying that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, my dad's going to,
you know, be in prison the rest of his
[SPEAKER_01]: life, you know, all, and he's hearing this
from teachers and things at school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the dare program telling Mike,
my daughter raised her hand in the dare
[SPEAKER_01]: program and said, you know, my mom has,
uh, struggled with opiate addiction and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has helped her with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I witnessed it and he laughed or told
her to sit down and never say anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: She, you know, what she was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had, I actually would go in and
sit into the dare programs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would be educating officers on
what cannabis actually is back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all this stuff happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the chief of police came over,
he goes, why are you willing to give up
[SPEAKER_01]: everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're, you, you got money,
you built a fucking, you've, you built a
[SPEAKER_01]: subdivision here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're, you know, your highest
standards are up, but then you're cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, man, I'll never give up on
this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my one thing in life that I will
follow through to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he stepped up from the, from the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting across just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stepped up with his hands out and he
says, how can I assist you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that moment, that's bridge building
one-on-one that came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, first off, we need to quit you
by you, you forcing people to grow weed
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors with numbers and forcing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are, you are, you are having kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doors kicked in and kids taken away from
the family over this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more so all the electrical fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then Cloverdale at that time,
it was one in seven houses that were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, not one of these people that
you go in and kick their doors in has,
[SPEAKER_01]: has good electrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're, you guys are forcing
neighborhoods to get burnt down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't call a license, you know,
electrician because he's going to rat you
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you got all these ballasts and all
these wiring and all this shit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's time to, to you guys are the
problem, not us, fuck your plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get growing outdoor in the backyard
and let's talk about pesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wrote him and I wrote the ordinance
and it was the first ordinance written in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world that said in cannabis
cultivation, there's no pesticides or
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicide use within the city limits of
Cloverdale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put that language in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened is now we ended up
allowing six plants to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now people were growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The complaints of the neighbors were,
you know, he, he got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, Oh, well we can deal with
complaints over the neighbors or faulty
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking wiring in a house that's going to
burn it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a no, it was a no brainer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like logic, like throw logic out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, would you, would you help me
try to figure this out?
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing you know, him and I are
friends and his officers are haters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hating me because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fucking hated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden I told, I have the
garden center in Cloverdale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling everybody, call me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting raided, we're going to
figure this shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these officers are kicking in door
still and their chief's not allowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting phone calls and I'm
running over there and I'm calling the
[SPEAKER_01]: chief of police and I'm saying,
man, this is fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would take pictures of ad avid
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd send me pictures, you know,
cause there's no use of it in Cloverdale,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would go over to the house and
I'd educate on the house instead of,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of arresting them for things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a whole educational thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pre prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy times to the point I,
with the same chief of police,
[SPEAKER_01]: he, he, I gave him cannabis and made RSO
on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was treating his, his,
his cancer, but he, nobody could know
[SPEAKER_01]: about it because he would lose his pension
and he knew he was probably going to die
[SPEAKER_01]: and his family would lose all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kept that on the under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I remember through a one time
when we were getting all licenses right
[SPEAKER_01]: before prop 64 was approved, Beasel Dorian
was getting raided and all the cops were
[SPEAKER_01]: up there raiding him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I called up the chief of police and
I said, man, this just ain't going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to call these guys off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually radioed in and saved
Dorian from getting rated at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you look at this outlaw,
you know, for me being a convict to an
[SPEAKER_01]: outlaw, to pioneering and having to build
bridges with people I never trusted who
[SPEAKER_01]: always were against me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's big shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it was a proud moments of my
life to get this industry from where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was to where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played a small part, but I did that
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all small parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is all small parts is all of
us doing our part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these passionate people out
there that are very devotional to the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet, it's all part of the bigger
picture and it's all part of moving the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think we're just stewards
of the plant in regards like, we don't own
[SPEAKER_00]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just moving the plant forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're just trying to advance the
plant to where it should be and where it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be and where it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like a, we, we saw,
you know, two 15 for people that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: there 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first kind of vision where
it's like in California, this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some day Dennis prone, man, hammered that
one down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like crazy times back then it was the AIDS
epidemic in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had the club.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the, the, where the pot shop was,
they got people like Jerry mum from Mendo
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and you know, all of them were
producers of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they produce cannabis for the two 15
and they had a house that Dennis prone to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell weed out of in San Francisco over off
of the tenderloin, not the tenderloin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget, poke street or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that was where the two 15
movement really came into and it saved
[SPEAKER_01]: people's, I mean, cannabis, cannabis,
cannabis, cancer, cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, AIDS, all that plays a super part.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my mother passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We from cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I carried her out of this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's where, I don't know if
you remember mama's boy 20 to one came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't really want to smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came up and I started working with a
few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lawrence Ringo was one of them,
got some of his cuts and started working
[SPEAKER_01]: on really on, with some people on really
good CBD lines back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, I came up with mama's boy
mama's boy was actually a squisher that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't turn to oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually wash it and get
consistency of, of, of rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy back then it was 20 arranged
at 20 to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was my mom smoked that we made
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did all that and she, she didn't take
her chemo or anything, but she lessened
[SPEAKER_01]: herself on the, on pharmaceutical drugs,
you know, and she was able, I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry her out of this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works so well, hand in hand with
these things, you know, you don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: die out on pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis fucking really saves
lives and makes end of death.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to argue that, you know,
there's still people that are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold on to whatever they heard from back
in the sixties and seventies and eighties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, if you look into it and you're
actually look into it, even guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanjay Gupta talking about these kids that
have seizures, like really bad seizures
[SPEAKER_00]: and how this plant can take away those
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you argue?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's, you can't, you can't,
or you're a fucked up person or you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad person that you might just be a bad
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't agree that a parent should be
allowed to give their kid a drug that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes away their seizures, that has very
minimal side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Lawrence Ringo, that's where,
that's where the Stanley brothers came in
[SPEAKER_01]: with Charlotte's web and Charlotte's web
was actually produced by Lawrence Ringo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably know that whole story and
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, Eric was involved with that
mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, we all were
upset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, you know, Lawrence, before he
passed away said, if it saves a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: child, who gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saves one child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think I care about me being
attached to any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can you argue?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't argue it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, it was a life lessons from an
elder to me that I'm able to process and
[SPEAKER_01]: think about as I'm getting older in my
time and apply that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: responsive responsibility of a mindset to
things that come up in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, he's like Charlotte's web,
Lawrence Ringo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a saver?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it help her?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gives a fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a, that's special right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a lesson to be learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got Germany going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a recreational country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the biggest recreational country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see other countries ready to follow
suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously there's Canada,
there's Portugal, there's South Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of those are medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are recreational,
but I mean, you know, Canada, big,
[SPEAKER_00]: big one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still not recreational on a
federal level here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully within the next three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say that every three or four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we have a new president,
it's like, oh, next four years we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would hope that within the next four
years, they have it figured out,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at the very least there's interstate
commerce allowed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be interstate commerce allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be in the commodity of,
you know, the commodity of agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the commodity of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I mean, that system doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at California, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm invested in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost millions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and the only, the only success story
out of here is the state of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like really, that's the only success
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put us all out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it purposely driven?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it where we ripped off for our votes?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we still being manipulated for votes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're, you know, we overtaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason that we shouldn't be
selling weed at farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the silliest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can't, or that you can't go to the
farm and buy directly from the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes zero sense, you know,
except for from a taxation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like, well, we need to tax it
three times before it gets to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what they want to do,
but that's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was paying more in taxes for a
pound of weed than I could sell a pound of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed for a few years ago in my facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the cog just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, we've come to a point in
business in any other business mentality,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 cents, you know, ROI or 10% ROI.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run a business on projections of
10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody in their right mind would say,
Oh, that's a business I want to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, we're seeing that 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we say, Oh, we can make this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to work harder team.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis industry do so well
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the people in them, both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the restaurants is like five to 7%
right now.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But California did pull the cultivation
tax in June, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's things we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stepping in the right direction in a
lot of ways, but there's also things we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fact that they're allowing,
uh, cannabis cafes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need cannabis cafes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not allowing them quick enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the bureaucrats going through the
city approval process and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then getting, you have to wait for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much rotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much, too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why you moved out of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I came here and I had the garden
center through COVID up in Cloverdale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is that when you're a grocery
store, you're a grocery store,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can allow it to be open because you're
providing what it says a word for that
[SPEAKER_01]: type of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was like, it's essential,
essential business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essential business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essential business, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were essential during COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was completely essential because I'm
teaching people how to grow food in their
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard and I'm teaching people how to
grow cannabis and I'm producing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling veggie starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city comes into me and says,
look, you're going to have to shut your
[SPEAKER_01]: store down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not an essential business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Hey, get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just shut the fuck up and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they came back at the cops coming there
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out through fit in the parking lot,
get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refused to put on a mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I'm that guy, but I refused to be
told what I, what I was going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was the essential tool in our area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was growing vegetables, you know,
shit tons of vegetables and giving it away
[SPEAKER_01]: to people like, like that is where the
move needed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, you know, I, that was one of
the factors going through that was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the reasons I figure like I didn't,
I was, I didn't want to do business in
[SPEAKER_01]: California because California didn't have
my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: EPA being a compost producer and things,
you know, it was just so much regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: and taxation on me at every angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I'm trying to be an honest
business where people are dropping $50,000
[SPEAKER_01]: in a paper sack for soil and I'm putting
it in the bank and I'm paying taxes on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, and I'm trying to,
I'm trying to build this business and be
[SPEAKER_01]: that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, California is just in
city, just, they just didn't want to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: good partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I needed to, to exit this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus we had the downturn and we had the
fallout of cannabis and 2021, my
[SPEAKER_01]: projection in 2021, when the, when we
started, you know, the downturn of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis started happening at 22,
I made, I think I made five and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: million, almost $6 million in soil sales
and my projection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to buy inputs and I'm
building up for the next projection of
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022 at 8 million, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I made $80,000 in sales and my projection
was 8 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately, you know, it was turned
into switch off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you remember I had the
houseboats on Lake Sonoma, ski boats,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all the shit I had and buildings
and houses and, you know, lake houses and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not dealing with so many of our
friends, so many people that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: basically scaled up cultivation
facilities, bought new locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: bought buildings outright because COVID
was so good for the industry and we
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was never going to end a lot
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got cut off at the knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that with seed to soil,
you know, all my money I made,
[SPEAKER_01]: I built out, you know, I built out a
cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I had my nursery set up in there
where we are the first facility pumping
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin into the legal market in the state
of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can remediate, I started in there and I
was putting all my money and building up
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was diversified when the collapse
happened and it hit me at, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at every angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really did, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just crushed me at every angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so Arizona wasn't so,
you know, it was getting out of California
[SPEAKER_01]: is needed for mental, my mental health for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, you know, I went through 22,
I went through a suicide attempt and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I was, I lost, I lost everything
and, and had to go, I had bankrupt my
[SPEAKER_01]: business up in Northern California on that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it just was, it was really hard
to, there was no roadmaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no anything on how to get through
this type of industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can search YouTube for how do you get
through, what do you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to attorneys, every attorney
wants $5,000 and they all have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: objective of how I'm going to get through
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all full of shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, that's kind of where,
you know, Arizona went out there and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I started the, the podcast,
my podcast bill for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was named out, it was named a soil
King legends of legacy, where I was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: panels of discussion panels all over the
country of, you know, legend legends of
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy panels of soil King, where I'd have
influencers out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was going to start the podcast
called soil King legends of legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my, my mentor, Dr. Greg Reed,
he said, man, he he's like, this was a,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was a year and a half year ago or so
a little over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, what's the one thing that you
wanted to do that you haven't gotten off
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, man, I'm just trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, give me one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, it's a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a Thursday night and he's my
mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got till Tuesday to have your first
podcast recorded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hustled and I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, as the time I was figuring it
out, I was like, do I want it to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil King legends, legacy podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, our artwork was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, or do I really want to talk
about the pain and grit of what we went
[SPEAKER_01]: through as an industry and business owners
and collapse?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a bill for this fucking shit,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's a coin bill for this
podcast came up and I started hammering on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's what the subject
line is about is really how did we get in
[SPEAKER_01]: any business for that matter, cannabis or
not, you know, there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the biggest people in the world
have failed number of times, but nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to talk about how they got through
those lowest points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, like I said,
I I'm a suicide survivor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I pulled fucking triggers
because I had to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seen a mental shot of my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went through some some deep,
dark shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened is I was able to to get
the fuck out, find myself and build myself
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, you know, I'm I'm building
companies back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming back from nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, spiritually, fucking
mentally, physically, I am the best person
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever been in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you recently lost a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost weight this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you recently lost a bunch of weight,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your boxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot down there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's harder to keep the weight on
down in Arizona, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's partially it's a mental thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody asked me, it's it's mental.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it is mental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to get over these mental
hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to restart my entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting beat up from every angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam, my partner as well, was getting beat
up from every angle during this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had each other in business back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had Amy in my life who was really
inspiring me to show up at the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a personal trainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a personal trainer and a coach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and when I was younger,
I used to box and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: watching my son is, you know, soil King
Jr. He's six, seven, and he was wrestling
[SPEAKER_01]: through high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started jumping on the match with
them and wrestling during, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: practice with all these kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really found something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I ended up buying a gym myself,
all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Amy and I started, you know,
working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went into the gym and all of a
sudden I started feeling good about who I
[SPEAKER_01]: was becoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could start my day off with I do my
I do a gratitude list.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I start my day off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a gratitude list.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second set is is, you know,
my once like ask God for what you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this is what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manifesting this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every day I write down what my
wants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third part is my give.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what am I going to give?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to be a good person today
and I'm going to tell some older person
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bring him into the front of
the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do good deeds throughout the
day and I'm going to memorize that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go into the gym and working on
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I started working this all
this building business is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could never be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head was telling me you'll never
fucking be the soil king.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never make it out of this hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never figure this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, I started believing in
who I was and I was accomplishing myself
[SPEAKER_01]: before I started work every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, that just was like infectious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was jumping on a treadmill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing bikes, trying to warm up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking this is the dumbest shit
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never like to go to a gym and jump on
a treadmill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a struggle, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then one day I decided I'm sitting and
there's this empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of bags in this big gym
in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's ever hitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked over to it and I started
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, my God, this is what I
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, four or five days a
week, you know, I'm doing, I'm doing six
[SPEAKER_01]: to eight, two minute rounds with 20
minutes in between just as warming up
[SPEAKER_01]: before I go, you know, hit the pile and
start doing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a whole different person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love myself today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the money, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have the properties I used to,
you know, I am, but I am a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: the best person at 56 I've ever been in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love myself more than I ever have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all that wreckage and that empire
that, you know, I retired at 52 and the
[SPEAKER_01]: empire imploded and I never worked so hard
in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trade it all right now for sitting here
telling you this story about how I love
[SPEAKER_01]: myself today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's power in that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then having a partner that drives you
to go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to, you know, I get up in the
morning and we smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't smoke weed before the gym,
I'm thinking, I'm hitting the bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: bam, bam, going at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm calibrating my day and what I
got to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the beauty of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, it's more extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll hit, I'll take dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a small dab before I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I do the, if I do flower,
I feel like I'm more winded a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dab opens my lungs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do, I'll do a nice, I do rosin
pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do rosin pens in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the invention of rosin pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, regular pens, whatever,
uh, you know, and I'm not hating on any
[SPEAKER_00]: other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hating on any other type of
extract, but rosin pens do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love rosin tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's something special about
rosin carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like the half grammars myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was up to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd all be half grammars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the best flavors in that first
half a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's too much hardware for a half
a gram in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make a half a gram, you're selling
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you make a gram, they're asking
you, why aren't you going back to the half
[SPEAKER_01]: a gram?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the two grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for me, it's like those two grams
don't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm like, I want the first half of
the gram and the other gram and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want someone else can have the
pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes zero sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think for flavor, I think the first,
the first half of the gram hits better and
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, it's like, when I get in
that mode, I can focus on skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can focus on footwork and I can look at
the bag and I can get everything I
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can at it without worrying about
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's with, with smoking the rosin
pen before I get into the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't smoke weed throughout the
day until after four o'clock, five o
[SPEAKER_01]: 'clock, you know, I'm smoking,
then I smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I train over at UFC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CJ comes over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We train sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Juan from Backpack Boys comes in,
reeking of joints, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lights the whole place up with smell,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got, he's got turps on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was with you guys out here,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm more of a, I'm more of an
extract guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like it makes, it's more
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gives me that flow and I'm not as
winded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OCPD or whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all settling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do, I don't, you know,
I don't, I don't really do dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only where I did dabs is when we were
doing like we were in the facility and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're mixing flavors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to come up and I take
little hits, but I've never been a big
[SPEAKER_01]: dabber, but at the rosin pen, I got one in
my pots where I smoke all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not all day long, but you know,
that's what I, that's my go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cool dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big hot dab guy, but I like my
nice cool dabs that have great flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just coats your teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that flavor for the next half
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You taste that tang on the back of your
throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I, that's where I judge good
weed in a doobie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you ever see me smoking the second
half of a joint, you know, I found
[SPEAKER_01]: something I like, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't smoke weed that doesn't taste
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could find that white thorn rose
or you can find those out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny has and all of a sudden I'm some,
I'm down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's down to the roach,
I'm going back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a ZDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I have any flour here today,
but I'll have to get you some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Skittles GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, I got some other stuff in it too,
but it's really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you like white thorn rose,
it's candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is all the other phenols
that we've popped, they didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't, they had shitty structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't taste quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like the perfect balance
where it's GDP dominant with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure's not great, but it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like for extract and other things,
I feel like if you like white thorn rose,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's right up your alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I'm gifting it to Johnny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going up there next week to give him
cuts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the only one that's getting it
besides my cultivation partner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the only one that's getting in the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, it's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Terps, but I also like chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tired of hazes once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get original haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm, I'm hazed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming back though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came down from the Hills in December
and man, it was coming back and people
[SPEAKER_00]: from Europe are like, what the fuck is
going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ariane from, from greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd never seen anything like that
either, just to be honest, that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: so many hazes in one place that were very
turpinoline dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was wild, but I feel like we
need to get away from the gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, they're good producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go away from the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's so many other things
to explore and yeah, it yields and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield is great, but let's go for stuff
that doesn't necessarily yield or find
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that yields that produces the
quality that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got Brett from California seed bank,
just crushing it on the, on the burgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did in Rosentech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love Donnie burger though,
even though it's a GMO cross, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's built for bag appeal and it
has ended when he, when he, when he,
[SPEAKER_01]: when he, you know, built that genetic
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Eddie was here and it was me,
him, you know, Eddie, I, we had Brett's
[SPEAKER_01]: and I were the adopted, had paperwork
before Eddie passed away, signed up,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of keep his heritage and legacy
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Brett and I remember they were
coming up with a, the burger name and I
[SPEAKER_01]: laughed at the burger name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the dumbest name ever
that you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you look at it and it's burger
this burger that, but we were at,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were at the facility looking at returns
on, you know, in Rosentech and it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that hit the highest was 7.24% and
that was a Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Brett has, he has his new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hitting over nine and over 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just imagine, just imagine that washing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Rosin return.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, that's not hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Rosin returns, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those, uh, genetics were built,
they were built for girth, yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: bag appeal and handling, you know,
outside weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Donnie burger myself, I do not like the
flour, but I love it when it converted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I saw it, I've tried the
organic, but flora and flame had some
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they gifted me and I was like,
eh, I don't know about this Donnie burger,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then he gave me the Rosin and I'm
like, I went to Riga in the river this
[SPEAKER_00]: year with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sharing it with everybody and uh,
it it's, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a good flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we put you in the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just lays me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one of those ones, you know,
I hit once in a while, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that isn't a, that isn't my daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way going back to the white
thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I brought, I brought Johnny up
to the gonjie campus for the first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With bags of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a, it was like our third class
coming through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we put it all out there and we did
our, you know, our approach on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blew everybody away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was, yeah, it was awesome to
see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then that's where it was like,
I, I touched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I touched in with Johnny before that a few
years on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, super impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just crazy how we, we evolve and
being part of the, you know, the original
[SPEAKER_01]: member of the gonjie was the way we built
that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that was pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, the, there was
Oakster Dam and then you guys have your
[SPEAKER_00]: own thing with tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonjie is about flavor pairings and
understanding profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: About really understanding the layers,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Layers are super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, when you, when we're working
about, when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachians all around the world and wine
and food and different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can actually taste it when
you study it and you taste it and you
[SPEAKER_01]: really have to identify this from the
smell to the dry hit, to the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: to how, how it tingles on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can tell when weeds grown in,
you know, if it's grown in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, just because of the soil
mushroom layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes with it versus if it's grown
somewhere else, he can kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, these identifiers are, are super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can tell if they're seagull shit
or bat shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're from North,
it's like, you can tell the guys that use
[SPEAKER_00]: the seagull versus the bat guana.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seagull actually worked better in
cultivating actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually when seagull came out and was
like, Oh, this stuff's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for a company called American
culinary chefs, best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work with like Yoplait and other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked on tasting panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 20 years ago almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would get Doritos chips or Fritos
or whatever, and then compare them to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things that are similar to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to break down the flavors and
they would try to trick us with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did, we did these panels and
basically they would certify products as
[SPEAKER_00]: American culinary chefs best with stars
that they could put like a little emblem
[SPEAKER_00]: that they got to put on like Yoplait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big one that you always saw
in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I learned a lot about taste
being a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's so many different
layers and it's also subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have memories from childhood that
can spawn some Rebar pie for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember Rebar from when I was a little
kid and I love Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to come up with Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody has a Rebar, but I
smelled it and it wasn't very Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, okay, somebody was just trying
to, and maybe that's the thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it could be an expression that was laid
on by either the nutrition or the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like phenotypical variation can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody grows it, cause it's
called Rebar, but maybe the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: they grew it, it was very Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next guy gets it and it's more
raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a Rebar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some Rebar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need some Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green tea, Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet tea, green tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, green tea or sweet tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's the beauty of this
plant is there's so many directions we can
[SPEAKER_00]: go and you will find Rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find green tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find sweet tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to start looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start with the right genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the original council members
for the Gange and just the history and
[SPEAKER_01]: being part of that whole process of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had an Oakster Dam and then we were
coming out with our program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have Frenchy Canole,
Swamy, Nick was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally it was 12 and it went up to I
think to 18, but we'd go to an Airbnb in
[SPEAKER_01]: Marin, big house and we'd stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the most craziest time because
we'd all come together and we'd argue
[SPEAKER_01]: between, I remember Frenchy and Nickatee
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody can call it hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash is ancient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy was throwing a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to quit the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you call it ice water hash,
we own hash, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm teaching the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm teaching the history of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call it sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can call it whatever the fuck you
want, but you're not calling it hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember these arguments we would have
and what we ended up having to do is we
[SPEAKER_01]: have, because we all had our individual
personas of ourselves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a public figure status.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're all head tight and not
really, we've been running and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: creating our own way, bulldozing our way
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this whole thing, we really had to
come down and really listen to one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I stepped back and started really
listening, I was being educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all did that and we all came
together and then we built this program
[SPEAKER_01]: called the Ganje Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all that whole entire time we were
building it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was white boards and PowerPoint
presentations and video cameras and
[SPEAKER_01]: producers and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filmed the whole thing at one off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really an exciting time in my
life to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really was, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you guys have a special
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But education is so important these days
on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of miseducation that's
available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to know what's right,
what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think we learned from
elders growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always elders, like somebody that
taught us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not available to everybody that's
passionate about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having programs like Oakster Dam
and Clover Leaf and all these things for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are interested, especially to
break into learning more about if they can
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there is information,
there's podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about stuff, but it's like you can
really dive deep when you go into these
[SPEAKER_00]: classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got and I've been working on another
project called Canitender.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a whole AI protocol and some cool
stuff that I'm releasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple different AI tool protocols
that are out there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's called the Probiotic Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is Soil King.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a whole Q&A and it goes down
to, you know, the probiotic farmer was
[SPEAKER_01]: really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took Alan Ackerson and Tim McCormick
from Culture Biologics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back then he's now, you know,
probiotic farmer is our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we took with Alan, we took all of
the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you remember the Facebook PFA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the PFA was like 13 years worth of
dialogue, research books, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: teaming with microbes, all the,
all the literature from 30,000 members
[SPEAKER_01]: across the world that put into this thing,
all the research, we were able to take all
[SPEAKER_01]: that research and upload it into our AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our AI directed it into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we taught the AI not to do
fallacies, to check for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for false identifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and now the probiotic farmer is
really like, we're getting ready to just
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, getting ready to launch that
it's going to be app on your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it talks everything, you know,
Korean natural farming, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it, all of it that goes into it and
the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's super cool because, you know,
you can, you can ask it anything and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: give you like how to make your own
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll give you all the research on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I do, I dive into minerals,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I dive into minerals on it and how
minerals can convert flavors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ask it these questions and it comes up
with all these different types of minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: that can take the job to where you need it
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a tool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this stuff that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should do a James loud seed one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk to you and my guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a course with Oaks today and
we're going to have a course that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a certificate course for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be a lot of fun,
but yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk, I'll talk with our guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's working at NASA building stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For AI right now, but he can take all your
book right now and he can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll put everything in your book and
all the curriculum that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to what AI will find on its
own and do its own research, the key with
[SPEAKER_01]: AI, you have to direct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to wander in areas like
for me on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to go towards synthetic
farming, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I, you know, put blockers in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not identifying that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's staying on this side of the path that
I believe in the organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: younger let's go like 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love myself today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk about, you know, part of my
story is the 13 year boy within at 13
[SPEAKER_01]: years old, I went home and I looked in the
door, looked in the windows, the house was
[SPEAKER_01]: moved out and my mom decided to move out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And leave me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was homeless and because of Niles
Canyon and because of growing weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to support myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived and I was homeless trying to get
myself to a mission high mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Hopkins junior high washing my
hair in a creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized your school wasn't for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talk about this 13 year old boy
within I embrace them and it's the best
[SPEAKER_01]: part of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm built by the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up, I ended up buying my first
house at 19 and started my first plumbing
[SPEAKER_01]: company at 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because I didn't go to high
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because I went straight to work and I
grew weed on the side as a side hustle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made side hustle money going to the
only reason I went to the high school was
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell doobies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did really good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the advice for myself would say would
be stay solid to who you are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with with who I am today, you know,
I found I found a power grader myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose to call God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that that would be just to
tap into, into faith over fear and
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go back into that and just keep
driving that shit happens and your life's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're worrying about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing constant has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like when times are good,
they're good and they're going to be bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're also going to be good again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad times build the great times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the bad times,
like literally, if you've never had bad
[SPEAKER_00]: times, you're, you don't know how good it
is when it's good, you know, and the best
[SPEAKER_01]: form of myself, right here, right now,
because of the bad times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad times make you who you are and
they do, you know, how you deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: things in those bad times defines you as a
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, if people are looking to find
out more about Pat King, where can they
[SPEAKER_01]: go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just Google the soil King.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much stuff that I'm doing,
you know, I'm building out licenses in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I teach, uh, you know, regenerative
agriculture on, on, uh, on agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, food scale, as well as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're, I have some of the
best farmers, I consult, uh, for the,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the best cannabis farms all across
the country here on living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor greenhouse and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just crushing it at every level
of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm known as the sourcing guy
that I check.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been the one that's sourced
clean products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I test for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, when I build them, build soils or
inputs or fertilizers, biologics,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything I do, I pre source before I
build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm part of a successful tool in the
licensed market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a lot of failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardest thing in this industry is
watching a lot of money go into converting
[SPEAKER_01]: into living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then at the end of the year,
they fail for heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fail for something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is just because they trust the
wrong partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get to there with my cultivators
and my farmers, they aren't experiencing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're going three years in license
without any fails, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: super important to be part of that team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hardest thing is to watch that
same farm that goes to living and fails,
[SPEAKER_01]: convert back to synthetics because it's
easier and there's dollars to be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have to be like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to be like that consulting,
you know, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic King consulting is still here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the soil, Patrick at the
soilking.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit me up on any, any platform at
the soil king YouTube, anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been amazing having you on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to doing this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to do this sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great moment for me on here
because this is James loud's podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, this isn't somebody that
came out a year ago with a podcast and his
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy is an OG in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at his genetics and what he's
done with the expressions and just coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into this facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're a pioneer in your field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a leader, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me to sit on the other side of
this with you, brother, it's respect,
[SPEAKER_01]: total respect.
