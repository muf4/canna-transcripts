Alright, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: and today our special guest is Eric from
flow gardens in Tennessee How are you
[SPEAKER_01]: doing Eric doing great James?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show This is the
first time we get to meet in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked a lot, you know, you're an
ambassador For the brand you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: our genetics in Tennessee You're doing the
hemp license thing and doing some really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm doing the best we can in a state
where it's still illegal to grow You know
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it looks like you're growing some
time doesn't even look like I've seen your
[SPEAKER_02]: flower You've sent me flower THC flowers
phenomenal that you sent me some chem
[SPEAKER_02]: cross that was just yeah super amazing and
I love seeing gassy stuff cuz like a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people don't Grow gas these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I fell in love with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually brought some more for you today
Yeah, it's a chem 91 cross with sour
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We named it chem trails And yeah that when
it was like day 20 of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was already sticking up the tent,
you know, so It's definitely one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that foul It does the one you
just have to keep on smelling even though
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so bad Not everybody likes it and
it's like those ones to her like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like it, that's okay because I like
it, you know Once it's something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: super nostalgic for me that that I grew up
on that smell and I like it Just reminds
[SPEAKER_02]: me of the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah new year 2001 chem dog when it was
first hitting the market and it's like not
[SPEAKER_02]: og It's got that chemi gas where it's like
a little bit foul But really loud where
[SPEAKER_02]: like a jar of it you open it up and it
really burns your nostrils Exactly,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can't pinpoint the exact flavor
But I like to describe like it smells like
[SPEAKER_01]: the 90s like like the way I used to get
back in the 90s Yeah, yeah, I love that
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you've grown some of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done some really cool work with
ours with the Mystic Mountain blueberry,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I haven't got to try yet,
but the pictures Yeah, the pictures sell
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm growing that actually in the
backyard in my little shop I got a six
[SPEAKER_01]: lighter back there and that particular
Fino just checked all the boxes and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be harvesting I think in about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that's ready to go, I'll
definitely send some your way Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just had humble seeds on the show and
so I'm glad you got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I you know I'm excited to show them the
flower because I feel like The blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: muffin is extremely special I think that
if you get something that's not blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: muffin that has some of the blueberry
muffin in it But it's different that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: great thing because like blueberry muffin
is its own thing and it's basically It
[SPEAKER_02]: sets some really cool trends up in humble,
you know, especially with it Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we had DJ shorts blueberry originally,
right and I think that got widespread
[SPEAKER_02]: There was other blueberries too,
but then the blueberry muffin is very
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry muffin Oh, yeah, like you smell
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like straight blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, almost like a rotten blueberry or
something Yeah, it's it's amazing and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's super sweet the structure of
it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got nice color It checks a lot of the
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one has a lot of the blueberry
but it also has like a creamy I guess it's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from the double lemon cherry maybe
Overdose and the bread a little bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's special for sure I'll tell you
what though the permanent midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are probably one of my
favorites right now every Fino's Just
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal in its own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I brought some today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait It's really been my smoke
that I've been smoking over a couple weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: now Yeah, we've been getting a lot of
praise for the permanent midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just when you put two good
things together Usually you get good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have so many expressions that
are good that it stands on its own There's
[SPEAKER_02]: so many different things that you can look
for in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's something for everybody,
you know and some people the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have color I find Feel like are
pretty loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you want the purple ones to be the
best ones But sometimes that's usually
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not the case, you know,
it's not and it's okay You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I think color is like this
qualifier right now that I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna be there forever I want the
loudest the one that tastes exactly also
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that has the best effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly Color is kind of secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although right now it's very prioritized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm So yeah, I think like the flavor if
it can resonate in the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last checkbox for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah That's a tough one to get it's like
when you refire that joint and it tastes
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about that Yeah, 100% So yeah,
especially if it's the Roach like if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: down to the Roach and you're like I don't
know if it's gonna taste good or if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna taste bad and you fire it up You're
like, wow, so yeah, we did some sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really amazing I'm beginning the
sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't had that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're around in the next couple
days, I think I'll have some Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge fan of sour D and fresh batch
is coming down nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I just I Like all all different
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like stuff that's floral It just depends
on what kind of mood I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, so yeah, but even especially
the floral stuff the the old-school GDP's
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm stuff that nobody wants to grow
because it takes forever to veg Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't yield that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although GDP has its place for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no doubt Yeah, I'm actually growing
one of those right now cross with northern
[SPEAKER_01]: lights number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice So still early in flowers,
so we'll see but yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that in Bubba Kush I haven't seen a
lot of good Bubba Kush coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Bud Gilaro Dave Perkins from Bud
Gilaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a really good cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very Bubba Kush and very soapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that soapy character Yeah,
and really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's nice And speaking of like I'm
trying to bring back the old school in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way like we do a lot of blue dream right
now That's like one of our biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: sellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah blue dream There have been poisons
another big one super silver haze and it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like our customer base is just going
back to that nostalgic Feel of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and people know those names and I think
there's expectations when you buy blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream You should expect to get something
that's loud too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, but it's not What checks the boxes
in California maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but overall, you know, it's not the
purple candy gas at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, right and it's something that's
more uplifting Sativa whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: call it there, but they're longer
Flowering varieties too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and there's something special about
longer flowering varieties to especially
[SPEAKER_02]: effect wise where it's like super
functional You can do anything on blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream exactly like literally you can do
anything go pass your driver's test on
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream because you drive better Yeah,
and that's kind of how that chem 91 cross
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's just very clear-headed very
euphoric in a way Yeah, it doesn't get me
[SPEAKER_02]: tight behind the eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm But it's also it can be strong if
you keep smoking it Oh, yeah, definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have a ceiling like some of these
things It has a creeper effect like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fine and then all of a sudden I have
Trouble talking and like oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely there Yeah, I like the
creeper effect sometimes but other times
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're not gauging it and you're
just in conversation You're smoking a
[SPEAKER_02]: joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, keep hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then 15 minutes later.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah certain things will get you there and
then auto flowers have come so far I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: sure if you've tapped into the auto flower
market at all, but I haven't really you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I mean our facility is a little like
yours where it's a research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development slash production in a way So I
haven't really don't have a room dedicated
[SPEAKER_01]: to auto flowers I've done a little bit in
the past, but I really haven't messed with
[SPEAKER_01]: them too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, are they getting more stable?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are getting I mean there so there's a
handful of people that produce amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flowers and then there's everybody
else and I think it's like that with most
[SPEAKER_02]: things Yeah, but yeah with auto flowers
There are people that produce stable auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers that express pretty even across
the board and there's other people Every
[SPEAKER_02]: single plant grows a different Size that
different shape you're getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypical variation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the guys that are growing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty straight across the board
that they're all very similar or almost
[SPEAKER_02]: identical got you and so Over time you're
gonna get better and better and better
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions more even expressions,
especially But a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on our flowers now, too So I'm
excited for auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love auto flowers outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a handful of guys that are
crushing it indoors Rue that you I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we've met on phone calls before yeah He's
crushing autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a lot of our testing for autos and
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and he's doing a deep water culture
You know, he's doing some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's a good dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess with me the auto flowers I
had a trouble I didn't even know you had
[SPEAKER_01]: to flower them under 18 hours of light for
a minute and so that was one of my issues
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I finally figured that out but
Yeah, I guess I just struggle with the
[SPEAKER_01]: stability of it in production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's one of those things
like for you you're Your market is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit different to going with autos
is kind of a tougher market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm, but uh, it's one of those things I
feel like we've overlooked them for so
[SPEAKER_02]: long and now they're starting to get good
and they're they're not for everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they definitely have their place
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they get a lot of hate Yeah,
but people don't don't always understand
[SPEAKER_02]: things and you know, there's a lot of hate
on all kinds of stuff Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: no doubt So yeah, and you're doing
breeding now, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I just started dabbling about six
years ago crossing and then Reading your
[SPEAKER_01]: book has helped me quite a bit You know as
far as reversing them now and then I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been self in some of my better Vino's
making seed with those And then mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: like I focus on type two flowers,
which is like CBD and THC And so I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: finding like my best like chem 91 I just
crossed with some of my best CBD plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah to make some type two seeds So that's
that's my big focus is type twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really medical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it really is and for me I'm a little
older and sometimes the type ones are too
[SPEAKER_01]: much for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those type twos just hit perfectly
Especially during the day, you know when
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get stuff done Totally and
CBD is just good for you in general feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh, yeah, I eat CBD I don't smoke as
much CBD as I'd like but I definitely have
[SPEAKER_02]: been eating a lot of CBD At night.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it definitely helps me with sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll eat two gummies before I go to bed
Inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I take like an anticancer And
histamine sometimes I take Benadryl,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't want to get addicted to
Benadryl because I think Benadryl can be
[SPEAKER_02]: very addictive Especially for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't like better because the next
day I'm like a zombie, you know Sleep I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: okay with Benadryl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but CBD there's never any like you
don't have any side effects from it It's
[SPEAKER_02]: always like you feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so yeah, and you just got a trip to
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did we went out to Canifest in Prague
and It was amazing Prague was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was magical City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the festival was it was very nice
got to meet a lot of seed breeders them
[SPEAKER_01]: from Italy some from Switzerland and a Lot
of flower people got to meet the people at
[SPEAKER_01]: one span of us for CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah last year really nice guys Nice,
which got from Norway or no, they're from
[SPEAKER_01]: Italy It's called like we need and they
spell it weird like weeds in the middle or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Europe their branding's real
caricature kind of cartoonish Totally
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get away with that in metric,
especially, you know California there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: cartoon anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to do that with the hemp
side as well Yeah, like all these new
[SPEAKER_01]: they're regulating it with the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No cartoons, you know all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no animals No animals stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No unicorns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, I mean it's it's still you
know, they're behind us in some ways in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe and it's interesting because I feel
like they're not jaded by The the rec that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've you know, the rec market All the
stuff that's gone on with the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still it's still like ten years
ten years ago And there's people they're
[SPEAKER_02]: still super excited about more excited
than they are in the States Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so and I just went to the Caribbean and
they're even more excited down there like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're you know Their flower isn't as
good as what we typically see in the US,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they love we they love cannabis They
love cannabis on a medical level on a
[SPEAKER_02]: spiritual level all these things and but
they're excited about it Like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They the smiles on their faces and how
excited they are in st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vincent and the Grenadines is pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that's good stuff and I have
noticed that like in Europe when I go over
[SPEAKER_01]: there I feel like yeah, like you said like
ten years behind in a way as far as maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics But in their laws like the laws
We've been shipping flour over now to UK
[SPEAKER_01]: and Switzerland different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like Switzerland I think is 1% tse
Germany just switched to 1% to oh really I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know that Czech Republic 1% yeah,
but then you have UK that's like 0.2,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you can't get anything but like a
CBG plant in there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of compare that to the hemp
industry back in maybe 2018 Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's kind of you look at it almost like
a fortune-teller like I see where that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going I feel like hopefully it'll take
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'll dial it in I think
everybody's kind of dialing their stuff in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that Germany went recreational as
big huge Yeah, it's just such a big step
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody, you know It's like it's its
impact is so big on countries like the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States that are holding out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like well Germany's doing it Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we really need to reevaluate what
we're doing over here on a federal level
[SPEAKER_02]: especially doing I mean the funny thing is
is like you can't even go state to state
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're medical, you know or state if
they're recreational so interstate
[SPEAKER_02]: commerce is off the table right now and it
needs to be a big conversation because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have so many medical and so many
recreational states that could be working
[SPEAKER_02]: with other states And there's you know,
there's a lot of money there for these
[SPEAKER_02]: states and you know I think it would add a
lot of value to the states that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: able to produce as much exactly and
especially places like California and
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon where they produce so much more
than they can consume exactly and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be where the hemp industry kind
of came in and you know now they're
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping it out as THCA right and then but
yeah, that does suck that that You can't
[SPEAKER_01]: do interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just happy I'm focused on
genetics and not flowers exactly I keep
[SPEAKER_02]: that focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's rough being a cultivator in
a licensed state right now even You know
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these new ones that are coming
online I mean that some of them they have
[SPEAKER_02]: only a handful of licenses and that makes
it more competitive to a degree But I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that if we're looking at states,
you know and the future of where it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: it has to go interstate commerce Yeah And
you know, I like the fact that hemp is
[SPEAKER_02]: legal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean look at Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their big loophole for Having legal
flower exactly and a lot of the East Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: states are that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Tennessee, right is one Yeah,
Kentucky just now went medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at getting a license up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the regulations weren't solid So
we kind of backed off that one but like
[SPEAKER_01]: states like Virginia, North Carolina Or
just you can still grow as long as it's
[SPEAKER_01]: under point three Delta nine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we all know doesn't really grow in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You can get away with a lot more a lot
a lot more in the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a lot less oversight for
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just working with people in
other states and everything else is
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly the books.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're safe I know yeah, which is really
it's really unique, you know being from
[SPEAKER_01]: Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Always wanted to do this for a living,
you know, and I knew one day I would I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew it never thought it'd be in this
fashion You know where we would still be
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal in Tennessee and I had to Move and
pivot over to the hemp industry so I could
[SPEAKER_01]: grow because I've always been an indoor
grower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I figured out I could grow,
you know CBD plants the genetically We're
[SPEAKER_02]: far enough along so you like that
Tennessee whiskey, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah Yeah, that's super close to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Kentucky bourbon is probably a
little little better for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like Japanese whiskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean, I like it all I don't drink
that much alcohol, but I do like Good
[SPEAKER_02]: whiskey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mostly drink mezcal and I drink tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me, too I switched to tequila right
five years ago getting older, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drink everything wine coolers Yeah,
occasionally occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah craft beers and now it's like all of
that gives me headaches Yeah, I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: drink any beer and I love beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love the way it tastes Yeah,
I mean I was drinking Sierra Nevada and
[SPEAKER_02]: Laganitas when I was like 18 years old I
used to love Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I worked for the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for Laganitas Yeah, I did all
kinds of stuff with Laganitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a chef and did their beer circus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and so we traveled all around the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when they were starting to become
a bigger company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that when they moved to Chicago and
opened up a spot there?
[SPEAKER_02]: They moved to Chicago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did some beer circuses out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did them in New York, Los Angeles,
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had to be a good gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know flying around with these guys and
these performers and it was like I did the
[SPEAKER_02]: backstage food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just you know, it was like disco
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it was gone, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was fun while it lasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was and in the beginning it was I've
volunteered for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the beginning it was a volunteer
gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got my chef friends together and we
basically went up there and put out food
[SPEAKER_02]: for the volunteers and put out food for
the performers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a blast and it was like it
turned into something where they were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, we got to take care of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we're with Heineken, it was
especially around when Heineken merged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and Heineken acquired them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They decided that they couldn't just allow
me to do it for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they had to cover my expenses and
all these other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like the company was just
accelerating so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just the energy was so good at
these events.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a lot of cannabis people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up to Petaluma years ago and got to
tour the brewery and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was very neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're the most cannabis centric
beer company in existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to Tony and Jeremy Marshall
and Ron and Jim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those guys just, we go way back,
especially Ron and Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like the 420 parties at their
brewery were always a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like that pavilion out there
where they'd have music and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even before that they had like in one
of the, in basically where they brewed the
[SPEAKER_02]: beer, there was an upstairs area where
they did, they had a bar up there and they
[SPEAKER_02]: had a 420 party the first Tuesday of every
month at 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was, it was always a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to smoke a lot back then too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And good beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just really good beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like they kind of saw beer,
how we see cannabis too, like Jeremy
[SPEAKER_02]: Marshall and Tony McGee, they had that
vision as far as like they, they've,
[SPEAKER_02]: they visualized how we've visualized
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were visualizing beer way back then,
way ahead of their time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now everybody kind of sees beer like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got all these different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, just like cannabis,
we've got thousands of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to beer, it's like,
there's also everybody's got their own,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, micro brew or craft beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever get into like sour beers or
anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like sour beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Belgian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Goza's you've ever had one of those
are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's funny in the Caribbean and we
drink warm Guinness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they, they make a special extra
bitter Guinness for the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you drink it warm and it's,
it's just the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I've been out to the
Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know a dozen times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just part of the adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, that's what everybody
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drink warm beer when I'm out in the
Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it good?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you buzzed pretty quick,
but it's also not actually, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like 7%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because regular Guinness, I think it's
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then I like dude, like traditional
beer in Munich, you can't beat the
[SPEAKER_02]: Bavarian ale and all the different beers
out in Munich.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to Oktoberfest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad was born in Germany, so it's been
on my bucket list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to go there this year
for their, uh, I think it's Mary Jane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to Mary Jane,
Germany as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, spandibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be there spandibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely be there with strain
hunters and a greenhouse seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to enter a couple of the
cups in spandibus this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might do your mystic mountain
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to promote it out there for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has a chance for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the extracts, they've really
stepped up, especially Spain is rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're rosin is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have rosin out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, really top shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love rosin too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, smoke mostly flour, smoke mostly
joints, but also rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while I was like, nah, I'm not
smoking those hash holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's like, I had a surplus of
rosin that people have been giving me
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been mixing it with joints and I
love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Skittles with different kinds of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried a hash hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to try one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet they're phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the day is young.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we can totally get into hash
holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's one of those things you
can go down the rabbit hole with because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like pairing flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I like Skittles because I
feel like it's a base candy flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can take that and you could
put almost anything with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go gas with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go more candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go any direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go with some of these papayas
taste amazing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The super boof cherry, which is one of my
favorite extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a little bit of tangy rind,
but also cherry and all these other
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just really loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some bubble leftover from the
dabadoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very small amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like a half a gram, but those make
some great hash holes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that dabadoo?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a couple of things about it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the dabadoo is this great event.
[SPEAKER_02]: For Mila Jansen, she's the hash queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she started it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was part of the one in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically what it is is a competition,
hash competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had three categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a, we had a bubble like ice water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had a traditional slash temple
ball category.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people enter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before we used to give little
small samples to everybody and Sam jurist
[SPEAKER_02]: from focus V and rosin tech, and he helped
put it on with me and we decided to,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of doing it the way where we,
everyone got like a 0.1, we were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have jars where people could get a sample
out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could, they could grade the visual
appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could get so many more things out of
seeing a big jar of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had five grams jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically got passed around and they
got to try all the different entries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had some awesome winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, we'd filmed a little documentary,
a little mini documentary for YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys should check it out if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and it's a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she does those all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, this was the 10 year anniversary
this year of San Francisco, but which was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was still amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it kind of fell together
last minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes those are the best ones
where it's like, you're not sure if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to do the best you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a really good team.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those guys did Sam's team.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those guys really put on a good show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it was a lot of last minute
stuff, it was like, nobody knew that it
[SPEAKER_02]: was last minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt very put together, put together
very well produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the whole thing was a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate, I miss this year's Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really wanting to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just couldn't make it with the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did in Oakland this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you got to come out for reggae on
the river and California can of fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What time, what part of the year?
[SPEAKER_02]: So reggae on the river is in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in August and can of fest is in
September and can of fest is in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's a music event too,
where they, it makes music and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: reggae on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cannabis stuff there, but it's
very music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think they got Royal gold and
some other people there, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the music lineup is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sound system is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the reggae artists are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're in VIP camping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of cooking there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then can of fest is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's in Humboldt super far away
from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a, it's a trek,
but it's, you know, it's a beautiful time
[SPEAKER_02]: of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't too hot out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going back next year for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to make that trip for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Kevin and John from cutting
edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I almost met you back in a MJ biz
con last year at their booth and I missed
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at their booth last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some good guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Kevin and John, big fan of Sean
and John.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do events together and party together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could listen to John forever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit down with him and he's got,
he's just a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hanging out with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just a lot of fun and same thing with
Sean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean is like, we had a blast with Sean and
reggae on the river and hanging out on the
[SPEAKER_02]: river.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sean's just, he's, he's a lot of
fun and he's smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love, he's like the next generation
coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at John and then we got Sean,
you know, right behind John and he's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's great having people like that in the
industry that care so much and that are
[SPEAKER_02]: not all about the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see the value in the quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality of nutrients, quality of what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stems over to everything else,
the quality of their friends, the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: of the food they like, the events they go
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the kinds of people we need more
of in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make some good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it's they're, they're great
people and they make good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fortunate that there's a ton of
people in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They care slowly, but surely they've gone
away, but that's a whole nother
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, there's, there's a lot of
big business and there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that still care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been tough as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough to compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to focus on quality of
your product, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you do because I smoked your
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I mean, we have to in the
CBD world, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't get your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got to taste good, got to smoke
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we focus on quality above everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the visual appeal of your product
is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the packaging, like you did
some packaging with, you did the Mac one
[SPEAKER_02]: with cap and you got the little hats on
the jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, this is, this is totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that side of the industry where you
can be creative and it's still is
[SPEAKER_02]: functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I'm sure cap loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still got to get him on my show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's incredible, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy is a character.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, once we started selling them,
you know, across the country, he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, this is historic for me, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, and it makes sense being in
the hemp industry, we can sell all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for him, his brand is California based
and to have it go all over the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that was a really good,
a good surprise for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's another one that cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's super passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who says the cap doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know cap because in 2017 at
Emerald cup, he wore his little disguise
[SPEAKER_02]: and he had the longest line.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was probably a 400 foot long line to
meet him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he spent time with every single
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know anybody else who does
that on that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is out there and wants to spend time
with the people that want to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, when, when you get it,
you get to a certain level, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they act like they're better than other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not naming any names or
specifically talking about any one person,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of people, they start getting
this celebrity status or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they start feeling like they're a
celebrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really we're just all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just all people trying to do our
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, none of us are special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we can get over that whole
thing, we're not special.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just here to do what we're here to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can get over that thing,
then you can really do amazing things in
[SPEAKER_02]: this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just cracks me up that he still
hides his character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's not many people in this world
that you can't find the face for the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, he's like Willy Wonka in a
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of his image, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and he's got his Mac one and
he's, you know, I think we wrote a case
[SPEAKER_02]: study in the book for, with the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was extremely valuable
as a partial triploid.
[SPEAKER_02]: A natural partial triploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really breed with it very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a, it's an interesting cultivar
and it is a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really is like I've grown
many plants and that one's like one in a
[SPEAKER_01]: million.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so, and you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a pretty good story about the
Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried reversing it a surprise like six,
eight months ago before I knew that it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't really good as far as good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I took 22 of my best strains
in the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite ones, pollinated it after
pollinating all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after they're done, I found 10
seeds out of those 10 seeds, one sprouted
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm growing that one in my house right
now and hope and cross my fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's a good one and it's
turning out to be decent, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize how hard it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably self pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even the funniest thing ever is
that you go and there's no Mac in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens, you know, and it's just
one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a good learning experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are good learning
experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do for your reversals for your
spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use, uh, is it sodium thighs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, silver, silver nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, we spray them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it three times a day, um,
until they're basically start producing
[SPEAKER_01]: male flowers three times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you use a very mild concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a hundred milliliters to about 500
milliliters, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one to five, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has their own recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good recipe in my book from
Khalifa genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't include a STS recipe that was my
own for liability purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a nano silver myself that really
works well for me and my friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Humiston makes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but everyone has their own recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: One way, and there's several ways to block
ethylene in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get a good reversal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, it's just, it's all about
trying different things and figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that are like one and done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spray it right when you flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have some, you have some male flowers,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have pollen sacks, you know,
so, and I've experimented with some
[SPEAKER_02]: different stuff and I keep going back to
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I like the way it reverses the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's super healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get these crazy reversals where they
do dump a lot different than regular
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, you know, your regular pollen,
you can pull either one little plant will
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate a whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a hundred thousand seeds,
more than a hundred thousand seeds with
[SPEAKER_02]: one male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one female, you probably it's five to
one, but it just depends on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some reverse real easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some reverse a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're harder to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding that out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No plants the same when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and you have to almost have a specific
SOP for each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some of them I found that you have to
start spraying a lot earlier on and other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones you could probably start spraying the
day before flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a reversal just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just spraying one time?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: On certain cultivars, if they're really
hard, I start two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I know the plant and I know that I can
do it in one week because a lot of them
[SPEAKER_02]: all do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can start a week before and then
you go until you see flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of time you start two weeks
before with the nano silver, I get the
[SPEAKER_02]: results I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're introducing them into
other plants, you basically flip your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your donors two weeks before your
receivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not always, I've had a more,
you flip them the same time and they come
[SPEAKER_02]: out perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain cultivars, basically they'll
produce male flowers a lot quicker and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they dump quicker, but I like short
pollen windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to keep them separate,
introduce, intermingle the plants and do
[SPEAKER_02]: that with as short of a window as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seeds are as even as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you introduce them to a female,
say you're dealing with an early finisher,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 50, 56 days, is there a certain day,
I guess you could say, or days like what,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a 70 day plant, would you still
introduce it around day 21?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Day 21 to 28.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on like the bud size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the bud size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how developed it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain things you may have to wait a
little bit longer, you know, longer
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering, but then some of the longer
flowering ones finish faster when you
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but you have to wait until you
have a substantial amount of bracts and
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the pistols that'll pull that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all very unique to each individual
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can, you can generalize and
say, okay, you know, three and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks on day 25, that's when you introduce
your pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I also love having
redundancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is having a jar of pollen
along with those reversals, because those
[SPEAKER_02]: reversals don't always go as planned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having backup pollen is one of the most
important things with breeding as a
[SPEAKER_02]: redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people, you know,
you learn that from fucking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned it from fucking up because I've,
I tried to reverse some stuff that didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse well and then I get good
reversals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think redundancies are one of the
most important things when you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So speaking of this totally off topic,
but speaking of like early finishing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I read somewhere about flowering 11 hours
on and 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finishing earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just some gross science?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that, I mean, there, there might be
some truth to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like equatorial varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently if you flower them 11 on and 13
off, they finish faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely get them to trigger
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like with triggering them faster,
there's all kinds of stuff you can do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but definitely like the longer flowering,
they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they don't want to flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so these 16 week varieties,
if you're doing them indoors, you might
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes it's lowering the light down
to eight or 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're only getting eight or 10
hours of light and the rest is darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also basically changing your
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your daytime temp, there's a bigger
swing between daytime and nighttime temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if nothing else, you can go hit them
with some PK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll get them going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just hit them with some PK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some, and you can foliar them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are like the three things I
would say if you're trying to get them to
[SPEAKER_02]: flip faster, if you're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those are just trial and error.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had friends give me advice
and tried it and it seems to work pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like longer flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my, my buddy Dave from
Budgellaro, he's kind of got me back on
[SPEAKER_02]: the path of longer flowering is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Longer flowering is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also stronger a lot of times,
but stronger can be good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's not always stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's like, uh, these ones,
they, they lift you up and then they,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just stay there, you know,
but you feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like stronger, like heart
palpitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really big into the anxiety weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got friends that tell me,
I'm like, I can't stand that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, that's the one I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heart racers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I got a heart issue as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to be, you know, faking
myself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do like, I like some of the upside,
you know, you sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I do like, you know, I, I do like a
good sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like effect, it's like a
stronger blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about with Kyle Cushman on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a stronger blue dream,
but it has that uplifting effect where you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like borderline panic attack for me,
but it's not, it's like right under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas some of the super silver haze,
if you dab some super silver haze that can
[SPEAKER_02]: get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Tangy might've been the strongest
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if it's sativa,
but as far as panic attacks go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried that back in, um, at his pride,
2016 in Denver.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've never got, I felt like Tangy
wasn't always as strong for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's, that's depending on when you
harvest it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be like, okay, they took it
frigging two weeks past where you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: normally harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll give you panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll totally give you panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Auto flower, auto flower will do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go like 90 days on auto flower to
try to get it to yield more, or you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's going to produce more and you
just watch it and you should have
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested on day 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be way stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think it's cause it converts maybe to.
It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they go up and you're
getting more Delta nine, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, you know, it changes the whole
cannabinoid profile, uh, terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and with the entourage effect,
you, it can be, you know, especially going
[SPEAKER_02]: like a week longer, sometimes they can go
up and then drop.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times I feel like that's
where you can get Delta nine in too,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go longer with exactly,
you know, if you harvest it earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be hemp, but all these temp
varieties, almost all of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you go longer with them, they're going
to turn into Delta nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll all get like, they'll all go past
that 0.3% threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that won't go past it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's so hard for the
government to make rules and regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like, dude, like if you
harvest it, you have this harvest window
[SPEAKER_02]: and you test it a month before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say what could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, and it's just so hard
to actually put it into numbers on a piece
[SPEAKER_02]: of paper where it's like, okay,
these are the rules for this reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: because every situation doesn't fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every plant is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've done thousands of tests,
COAs looked at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what we have to do in our
industry and certain plants you can take
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to term like a Mac one,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just do an early test when it's
not all the way cured out and you'll get a
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Dante's Inferno, I believe is
another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could even take that a little early,
but it's going to fail every time just
[SPEAKER_01]: cause the Delta nine spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donnie burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have Donnie burger around here
because it's like, one of those ones is
[SPEAKER_02]: just test dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll test past that 0.3 threshold from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, so, and there's nothing,
I love Donnie burger extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Florian flame for growing
some of the best Donnie burger and making
[SPEAKER_02]: the best rosin with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenomenal stuff, but that stuff tests hot
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's like, I do hemp
research development.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep it on the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's just easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a question on like drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're drying and get like when,
what day?
[SPEAKER_02]: So 60, 60 is a rule of thumb, but like
sometimes you can go that 60 to 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as for humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think like when you smoke,
like when you pulling it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm an early, like I like smoking
when it's, you know, mid teens,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm hanging, like I don't like
waiting too much farther.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually go 10 days and then we trim it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's just depending on the
situation, but like around 10 days it
[SPEAKER_02]: start, you know, but I feel like 14 days,
it's, we do a 14 day dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 14 days is the normal dry period,
but sometimes we'll trim it at day 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how big the buds are and all
the other things, you know, you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for that crack with the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I'm saying is I just liked
the buzz better when it's early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the terpenes and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean when you harvest early.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not necessarily harvesting or a
bit smoking the flower before it's cured
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say one month cure,
two month cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been a lot, I've been,
so the funniest part, that's great that
[SPEAKER_02]: you brought this up because I've been
going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like, especially with the
skittles that we've been getting that my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have cultivation partners and these
guys over SF candidate are crushing it on
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole nother level.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did some dirt skittles recently and
grown in soil, dirt skittles, dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it dirt skittles, but it's just
soil grown skittles, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But side by side with the cocoa grown in
the same environment with the same
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition, same lighting, everything else,
same flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dirt skittles was fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is they harvest on day
53, but it's a fresh product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you harvest it right, correctly,
you dry it, cure it right when it's done
[SPEAKER_02]: after the two weeks, that's when it was
the best, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week three, it was still good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week four, it was still good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Week five, it was starting to be not as
good, but like literally it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time I smoked skittles
where I'm like, damn, the skittles is
[SPEAKER_02]: strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: That it would cut your teeth like from a
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I have some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, it's like one of those ones
where it's like, and that's when it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the like connoisseur flower that
it's grown at this level where you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: even get it that good every time you grow
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like fresh, fresh is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turplocks are great for preserving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got Lance coming on the show
soon again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I think there's ways to
preserve it where it's good, but the best
[SPEAKER_02]: is that fresh, fresh product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you like turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel like the effects are
cleaner and yeah, not as heavy,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess is the word maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's cultivar specific too.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the stuff lasts great for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but the stuff I really like,
like that Z it's just, when it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: freshest, it's the very best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I've ever tried straight
skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll change your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've grown a lot of your crosses with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never actually tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the funny thing is a lot of those
traits that you're looking for with the
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles are recessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you smoke it, like a lot of times in
the progeny of the seeds that are crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, you're not going to get it right
out the gate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to do work with the breathing and
like some of the back crosses have some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the skittles stuff where it's skittly,
but then the skittles has the shitty
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always the ones that look the
worst where you're like, no, that's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're like, fuck, it smells
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's, it's like, there's so
many times where you're like, you go
[SPEAKER_02]: through the room and you're like,
that's the, that's the one it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: the one, but then you go to smell it and
we go through rounds for pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go through the rounds on the plant or
we're like smelling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times the ones that look the
best aren't the ones that smell the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that trade off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you dry and cure them and
then you have them in the bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when that's the real test,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, well let's line them all
up and let's smoke them and compare them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that so much fun?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Christmas every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that where they, it all lines up
where it's like, fuck, it looks amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: smells amazing, tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It checks all these boxes and it's like,
wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go through 600 plants and you
might find 60 things that are worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you might find five or six of
those that are, that are pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: standoutish that you want to keep running.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's funny with pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you pheno hunt is what's your
typical seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many do you usually do per
variety?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every year we're doing different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing tons of stuff outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing stuff in different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working in the Caribbean now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so next year we're going to be doing
some variety testing and pheno study down
[SPEAKER_02]: there to see what actually performs the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited about that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause now we're looking at, you know,
more of a tropical type climate where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: high humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stuff that has powdery mildew
resistance and botrytis resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to stand out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you're in that human environment,
that's warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's just a recipe for
ruining your OG kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically the opposite of what
y'all have here pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the opposite in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's so hard to dry and cure and
store the flower correctly in those
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally possible, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need a controlled environment to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just do it in a hut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to spend some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to take some time and you have to
do it correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think St. Vincent in the Grenadines
is this amazing place and they have this
[SPEAKER_02]: really amazing opportunity within the
cannabis space to impact the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: life for the people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's being, you know, supervised by
the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very supportive of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like great when you go to the
government and they're like, how can we
[SPEAKER_02]: help our people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of you guys are just annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause over here, we're just more or less
annoying to the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's we're not going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know we're not going away,
but we're more like this thorn in the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know, they, they wish we
could go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Redheaded stepchild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know, down in some of these
places in the Caribbean and not,
[SPEAKER_02]: not to say there's bad people in the
government or there's not people that care
[SPEAKER_02]: cause there is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But down in the Caribbean, the government
and they have the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: authority, the MCA, and they are very,
very supportive of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can we make our people healthier?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we take this plant and use it as
medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I feel like they all
recognize that the island was built on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders of cannabis growers and how can
we support our traditional growers as
[SPEAKER_02]: well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's this different mindset down
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the support by the government and
the people in the government that talks so
[SPEAKER_02]: highly of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see that very many places,
you know, I think a lot of politicians are
[SPEAKER_02]: afraid because they're going to lose
votes, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's got to change slowly,
but surely there's years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's guys that we're not young anymore,
but there's guys that are young coming up
[SPEAKER_02]: that have very positive outlooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like slowly the old guys that
are anti are going away and it's becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: normalized and it's not normalized fully,
but it's definitely becoming more normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 20, 25 almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still, I'm still in a legal state,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then places like Texas, I never
thought it would be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got CBD shops everywhere and
they're selling flour everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something else I noticed in
Prague when I was out there, they had
[SPEAKER_01]: these cannabis shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only 1%, but it's not really
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a wild west out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a free for all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all the same flower too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all basic garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and these are steps to getting it
normalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, even though the Caribbean is
the flower that I saw for the most part
[SPEAKER_02]: was not that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and also controlling the temperature
and humidity in when you're storing it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like people carrying around,
showing people and using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like every time you open that jar,
you get humidity and flour and all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sudden your turps are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're left with something and a lot
of it's sun grown and not grown with
[SPEAKER_02]: proper nutrition typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're not getting a super
resonance product anyway, but some of it
[SPEAKER_02]: was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it has potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the whole country has
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the whole Island has potential
to do great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is such a neat project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's like, all we have to do is
be right one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we're going there to work with
the government to do these breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we can go learn a lot
about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can learn a lot more about the plant
working there than I could doing stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, we can do a lot here
too, but I can do it here and do it there
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the potential for
collaboration with other international
[SPEAKER_02]: brands is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's other people that are in
the same mindset that we can go in and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love working with people that have
that same belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's doesn't have to be about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be just about money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be about making a difference for
the people and building the community from
[SPEAKER_02]: the inside.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going there to sell them seeds
that I make here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go there and I want to help them
breed seeds so they can create seeds on
[SPEAKER_02]: the Island for themselves and infuse that
money into the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's so much benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get so much benefit out of doing that
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, besides feeling good,
besides, you know, feeling and knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's what you're supposed to,
like, I feel like that's what I'm supposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to be doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that that's part of my reason that
I'm on this planet is to do good things
[SPEAKER_02]: and do things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I feel like this plant found me in a
way, you know, growing for almost 30 years
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every, everything from crawl spaces to
attics, the basements, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever I could find a space.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're on the right path,
you know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like start things start to line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if things aren't lining up,
you need to reevaluate your situation and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what you're doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like when you're doing the right
thing, a lot of times things will start
[SPEAKER_02]: lining up for you out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are lining up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some of these long shot things
are like, wow, this is really coming
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on stage with Marlon Asher at the
reggae festival, cannabis in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of people presenting the head of
the medical cannabis authority and
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting it for the minister of
agriculture and other people presenting an
[SPEAKER_02]: economic plan that could hopefully infuse
hundreds of millions of dollars over the
[SPEAKER_02]: next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, but it takes more than just
presenting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I can just present them and
then they're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be, here's some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be, okay, here's a game plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now who do I have that's going to help me
with this game plan down here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are we going to execute this
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people get excited about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like just talking to the people,
they're excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like some of these
companies down there too that are already
[SPEAKER_02]: in existence are excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one beautiful thing about this plan
is it brings people together, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, nobody gets this excited
about tomatoes, but cannabis is just-
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomato farmers do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you don't know any tomato farmers do
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think- Actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made some more jokes around tomato
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomato farmers do get this excited about
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get- So I grow heirloom tomatoes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year I grow heirlooms in my
backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year was no exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we grew some awesome, awesome tomatoes
and I get excited to eat heirloom
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love fresh heirloom tomatoes that have
never been refrigerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't get that quality in the
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it's like, I don't know where
I'd be without tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only do they taste so good,
but you feel like when you're eating them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just so good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're so clean, the flavors are so
clean and they're sweet and they're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: mine aren't very acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heirlooms I get are very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of acid, but it's not
like when you refrigerate them that you
[SPEAKER_02]: get this acid that comes out of,
I can't remember what the chemical is
[SPEAKER_02]: called, but Ryan's going to put it up on
the screen for you guys right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, but they do use ethylene to ripen
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second you refrigerate them,
it creates this chemical compound that
[SPEAKER_02]: changes them chemically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have a different flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of varieties did you grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do some purple varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, we always do a cherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a Comanche, I believe it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, and then we do like a hybrid beef
steak, but typically it's heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever done a Cherokee purple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherokee purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually out from where I'm from
out in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are great and they grow in most
places and they, they yield pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've been around forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're, they're one of the
most flavorful too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do it with a little bit of
burrata, a little bit of fresh basil that
[SPEAKER_02]: you grow on your own property,
the fresh olive oil, it's fresh balsamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could eat that every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, you're in Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are expanding to Europe too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause so the THCA market here that,
uh, we graded kind of like two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, um, since then the CBD market
for flower has kind of gone downhill in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U S so being that's all we can grow in
Tennessee at our two facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had to branch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been focused on finding other
outlets for a flower and fortunate enough
[SPEAKER_01]: we have in the last six months,
I went to London for a, uh, expo out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, met some people and then,
um, slowly, but surely, I don't know if it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the Emerald cup wins or what,
but in the last six months, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: flow gardens has developed quite traction
out in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially, but also in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a family-based business.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom works there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my sister runs the other
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the best trying to keep
everybody fed and going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a lot of people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not all roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we actually were starting up another
facility, uh, I've been Virginia where we
[SPEAKER_01]: can grow the THCA because they're starting
to change the laws in Tennessee now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you don't like roller
coasters, yeah, you don't need to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry because it's all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, if you don't like stress,
I feel like that's just also owning a
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be the master of stress,
but not having a clear runway is the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically just every month
navigating the needle and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, you're compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got to do this new thing to
be compliant again and keep on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I mean, that's just part of
the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a volatile business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love the plant so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way I could ever think about
doing anything else at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's great when you can wake up in
the morning and be excited to work,
[SPEAKER_02]: even when it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never gets old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, every day is like Christmas.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, there's always something new to
learn and ship breaks every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always floods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Floods.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys get floods.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're known as flood gardens half
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, uh, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in the, yeah, it's, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how's power out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it expensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm wanting to throw out a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like 11 cents a kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as cheap as Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some areas in Washington are like,
I think seven or nine cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even still, that's just so cheap
compared to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely, uh, I'd say so like
San Francisco is super expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went out the dinner last night and I
was like, wow, it's like 20 bucks for a
[SPEAKER_01]: salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about that big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the food's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's the thing with food
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's a price point for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go spend a hundred dollars on
a salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a spot for that same small salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be different, probably less
ingredients, more organic and a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars and a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the salad.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bread is probably $20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were a chef, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a chef for years, uh, on and off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I still cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still cook for my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much more fun cooking for your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm not a cannabis chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do the infused dinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never been my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, just because I'm not, I prefer
smoking and eating and I'm not big on
[SPEAKER_02]: putting a whole bunch of THC in my dinner
so that I'm high an hour and a half later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just doesn't, for me, it doesn't
appeal to me putting terpenes in or frying
[SPEAKER_02]: some fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some deep fried fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never tried that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Panko crusted fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, or even just frying them crisp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's all kinds of cool things you
can do with cannabis that I think would be
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as infusing, like infusing
dinners aren't my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a lightweight when it comes to
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love rosin gummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some of those before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're from out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have them gifted to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosin Tech does, they, they did these
white thorn rose ones and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, they added no flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the flavor of the terpenes and it
was that white thorn rose that was just.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell me a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard so much about that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's the flavor on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been dying to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got like a nice floral character,
but it's like, it's not just the flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: that makes it so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's vanilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's purple flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gorgeous looking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beyond special because I call it feel
good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call it whatever you want,
but for me, it's that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smoke in the morning, the
afternoon, the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smoke it when I'm in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could smoke it when I'm in a bad mood
and it still makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like if more people were able
to try it, they would all like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel like some people, they might
get a bad experience cause they got too
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got too high or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily get too high,
but you get, you get the right high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the right effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only a handful of things I've
experienced in my life that have that
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's like you smoke it and you feel
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like euphoric.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost euphoric, but you just feel
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not tight behind the eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not, you know, your, your face
isn't tight in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, it relaxes you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, you feel really relaxed and
you feel happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the world needs more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there's nothing wrong with
the anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, there's somebody who likes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's definitely people who
like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, and the, the further
along we get with these, these breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: projects that people are doing,
I think the more we discover what's out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and there's people that are
prioritizing effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a lot of people that
prioritize the way it tastes or the way it
[SPEAKER_02]: looks, but a lot of people need to go back
to that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've had Venus like that,
that were just, you know, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the effects just weren't there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore I don't put that one in
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it has to have that feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, the feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need another Oreos like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't taste great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I'm, I'm super anti purple
punch, but again, these things are one
[SPEAKER_02]: step away from being great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need to be worked, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think purple punch makes some great
crosses that have great effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as.
[SPEAKER_02]: By itself, like these things where
they're, they're called cardboard turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fire it up and it's like, you almost
taste flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like for Oreos, it's just not a
good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't enjoy the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nothing special, nothing
special, nothing special about the effect
[SPEAKER_02]: or about the, the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a growing some ice block from third
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Oreos and a blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That blockberry is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a special tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super vigorous plants, like huge fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just harvested a couple of plants last
week, but, and yeah, they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real like a punch breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried that one before?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like fruit punch overtones
really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've tried punch breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cadillac rainbows.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one never had Cadillac rainbows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like garlic and onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just fills the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the most pungent flower I've
smelled in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once again, anxiety.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many directions you can go
with effect too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's not either a sedative or
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just, I mean, we can,
people box them in these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, there's all these different
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some give you the munchies like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's specific things I've been
dieting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lost a bunch of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's things I cannot smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's specific cultivars that grown by
my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way they taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way they smoke, but then they
make me want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clear out the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally raid the fridge at two in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the, yeah, I mean,
I think GDP is the one that it's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those ones that always made me hungry all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I prefer the other, but then I got
this boost pen that's THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're growing any THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, not really though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this, this pen that my friends
gave me from house of cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this new THCV pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some other stuff in it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other cannabinoids, tert specific
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me have, not only did it make
me have anxiety, but it definitely didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: make me hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me feel sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking it was something else
that was making me sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought maybe I was getting sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: My stomach was twisting and literally went
in the bathroom and like dry heaved a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Oh man, couldn't figure out
what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I felt better after a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went and took another hit and
I'm like, fuck it's, it's the pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, uh, it's a weight loss pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've, they've, they've got this pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think probably I was hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was trying to feel better with my
stomach because I'm hitting it more
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking that it's going to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually making me feel sicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it has that effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other thing with cannabis
is there's like this effect that because
[SPEAKER_02]: our body chemistries are so different,
like how it affects me and how it affects
[SPEAKER_02]: you could be completely two different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years from now, hopefully they'll have
all that figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I can do some research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's so much to it, but there's
that feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, I think most people with the
white thorn rose, there is the blue 13
[SPEAKER_02]: from Dave Mesford.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get those seeds on my site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time you guys are watching this
podcast, the blue 13 seeds from Dave
[SPEAKER_02]: Mesford will be on the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be available at jameslydegenerates
.com and it gives you, it's that feel
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that feel good effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like sometimes it's like that
for me, but not for my friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get that same effect,
but this stuff, person after person after
[SPEAKER_02]: person gets that same like, wow,
this stuff makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you know, you're onto something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you know what that crosses the B13?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the blue 13 is blueberry haze times
King Louis the 13th from Kevin Jodhury.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dave Mesford passed away on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gifted me as the steward of his seed
collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to slowly be releasing his
seeds on our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: His kids benefit from the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another good, you know, he was a good
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took photos of me back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We became friends over that and he passed
on 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the weed aficionado guy who loved
flour, loved cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He lost a battle to cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you get older, more and more people you
experience losing their lives to cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, one more reason why we do
this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not a big tobacco smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends died of esophageal
cancer and that got me off tobacco for the
[SPEAKER_02]: most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke a good cigar every once in a
while, but I'm not a cigarette smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, even when I'm drinking, I won't
smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I used to, and that's what it was my
crutch when I was drinking, I'd want to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke a cigarette, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally got past that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got off most of the drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I very rarely drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I got a bunch of clean and sober
guys in my circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rue, he's another one from Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, uh, yeah, he's, he's a good influence
on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to have him and Al Kanisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are both sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great having guys that are sober,
uh, you know, cause it's, it's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those things, you know, peer pressure or
whatever, but when you're a circle of
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and everybody drinks and you're
the guy that doesn't drink, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: it's harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's easy if you have a medical
condition or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you don't say, Oh, well what's a
beer going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what's this going to do for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like about health and I'm trying to
like lose more weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've lost a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a bunch to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The older we get, that's, we have to focus
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, dude health, you can't eat
cheeseburgers all day anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Health is wealth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do love a good smash burger.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, then you gotta watch out for gout
when you get older.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gout will kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you can't win for losing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we can try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had one thing that you could
tell your younger self, what would that
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be patient and, and know you're going
to fail and just keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that's all you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it my whole life and I can't
believe I'm sitting here talking to you
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in the hemp space, you know,
it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a beautiful thing that the hemp
space is a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, uh, you know, before 2018,
it wasn't even possible.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and then even 2008 was Rocky for
the first couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's when I started was around
2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember them passing it in 2018 and all
my people were like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but we still at that point
didn't even fathom THCA being a thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we were just glad to sell the
CBD under 0.3 and how it's evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's kind of funny to sit back and
look at it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just Delta eight got wild
garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the Delta eight by itself as
a molecule is just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the problem is, is people
take their shit and they process their
[SPEAKER_02]: shit into Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they can't do anything else with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something they have the shit
distillate Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they put that in gummies and all
these other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, but by itself, Delta eight is a
great molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as far as the effect, it's,
it's a fifth as strong as Delta nine THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think it has value, but I think that
we're not focusing on it in the right
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, I took a gummy once of
Delta eight and it hit extremely hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great giggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the first time you ever were high and
then the hangovers set in and it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it basically the next day, I just felt
like garbage and that was just my
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm big on like the 25 milligram Delta
eights that I know where the Delta eight
[SPEAKER_02]: was sourced through a reliable source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt good from Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's very mild and it helps me
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Delta nine, I cannot sleep on
Delta nine for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I can, but it's after I've been high
for a bunch and then I crashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I like the mild effect of Delta
eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's so many other cannabinoids
that are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So THC is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is CBG is, I like CBG a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a great CBG variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 19%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that for smoking for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not found super terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've yet to find stuff that's really terpy
that holds high levels of CBG,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think that's, that's on the project
list for the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked on it for a minute doing
different CBGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I tried crossing them with THC and
then didn't realize that all the CBG would
[SPEAKER_01]: just convert over because it's the stem
cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I did finally find, um,
this particular phenose CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We named it white cheddar because it had a
terpene profile, not a crazy one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but probably the only one I've ever found.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does smell like kind of like white
cheddar popcorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, great effects though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cup of coffee or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely send you some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about that caffeine weed too,
as long as it doesn't make my heart race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good to mix with other flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like rosin, I can smoke rosin first
thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super clear headed and I go to the gym
and I work out and I feel great and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't feel high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I was to smoke a big joint right
before I go to the gym, I'm not as
[SPEAKER_02]: motivated to work out hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it could be, it could be,
but it's first, it could be the scars in
[SPEAKER_02]: my lungs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but like one good dab and
I'm feel like I'm on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this thing right here,
this is the heiress for focus V with the
[SPEAKER_02]: new atomizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is rosin extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is my rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, instead of a rosin cart,
we now have a mini dab rig that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super portable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a handful of them on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packs, I think packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out with a little small one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, then there's like dipped device
has this flower one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll, we'll show this on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give these guys a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a volcano in a pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're all about that old school
volcano.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a venti from stores in big
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, I mean, this is just like pack and
go super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the size of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the temperature control of this thing
is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like having a dab rig without the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I don't need water for my dabs,
but I love this and I can sit in the car
[SPEAKER_02]: right when I go into the gym, take a nice
fat one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to start the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think good rosin too is like,
it makes me super clear headed,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if I'm doing something in
repetition, like I'm lifting weights,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I can really focus on the muscles
that I'm trying to target or the cardio
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can get into the music and not have
to worry about my feet moving or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as breeding, you're making seeds
now you have some available on your
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have, um, mostly type two seeds,
some type three seeds, uh, and then on a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of type one seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mainly focus on type two seeds,
breeding a CBD genetic and then a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I'm getting a lot of different
profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I feel like the effects are
really clear headed, no anxiety,
[SPEAKER_01]: no paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that are THC sensitive,
this, these type twos are kind of where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get on some of these
distribution websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite there, but we're getting
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

company, the seed distributor.
