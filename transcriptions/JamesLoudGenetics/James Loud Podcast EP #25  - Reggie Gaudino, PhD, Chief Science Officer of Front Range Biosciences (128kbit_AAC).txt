[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today my guest is Reggie Godino.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Reggie?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're able to join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you joining us from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in San Diego, and it's not sunny,
so it's been really cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I met you was probably
around 2012 or 2013 at Steep Hill when you
[SPEAKER_01]: were over there in Emeryville.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out in Oakland, though,
actually right by the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then it was Halent originally
before Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was Steep Hill, and then there
was Halent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Halent was run by Don Land and Cameron
de Cesar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came from UC Davis, and David Lampack
had started along with Addison Demora,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Steve D'Angelo, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They had started Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were like the two big
competing factions, and they combined,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the history was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting times.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the very infancy of genetics,
as far as testing genetics and COAs and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff kind of came out of that
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first sex test on the market was
from Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point, I think it made it a
weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a billboard up on the 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it a weekend before they made us
tear it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sexier genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we followed that up a year later
with the first CBD test, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of that was built on the fact that
we had built that chemical database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not the sex so much as the sex was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some buddies who were willing to
give up some males they didn't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sequenced those when everybody else
was sequencing females, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody wanted the THC genes or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, well, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about things like sex
determination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody care about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think once the price gets a little
lower, I think it's already pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it gets even lower, everybody's
going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about that, and I think the COVID
pandemic helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff that was not mass produced
in such quantities because it didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a day-to-day use in everyday life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole idea of genetic testing and the
RNA testing they use for the COVID is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much a lot of the same kind of work
that we do for HPLVD testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an RNA virus as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now these things are being cranked out
and the prices have gone down,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cost of goods that it used to cost
us to run those tests has gone down
[SPEAKER_00]: because people are now DNA primers for PCR
are a dime a dozen now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the prices have really come
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need the people who know how to
interpret the results, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before COVID, people didn't even know what
PCR was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the average person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now everybody knows what PCR stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a sign of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a sign of why the prices are
coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the day, when we first
started, with our cost of goods,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to charge like 15 to 20 bucks for
the sex test, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People were offering it for seven,
eight bucks now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me how you got started in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mistake, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at the time, my day job was the senior
patent advisor or the senior patent agent
[SPEAKER_00]: for a biotech company called Sequinome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sequinome was the company that had
invented prenatal diagnostic testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could do a complete fetal
karyotype from the blood draw of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a side gig, I did IP evaluation for
other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David Lampack happened to be friends
with my cousin back when they went to high
[SPEAKER_00]: school in New York and suffered in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like one town over in Muncie,
New York, but I never knew David,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So David was talking to my cousin and
said, wow, I wish I had an IP guy I could
[SPEAKER_00]: trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my cousin said, well, my cousin's an
IP guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you talk to my cousin,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I met David Lampack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was back in the time,
I don't know if you guys remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantican, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Quantican was the first near IR,
like, you know, instant non-destructive,
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate measure of, you know,
everybody's doing it these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Steve had the first near IR potency
detector or evaluator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came in, I did the evaluation for
their IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, because they were
already selling Quantican, they could no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer patent it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and what I found was, is they had this
treasure trove of data they had been
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting for already the years they had
been operating, you know, all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: database of chemotypic information from
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once you have a database,
right, that's immediately how you start
[SPEAKER_00]: building markers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll look for the differences in the
populations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's a segregated, that gives
you segregation of genes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said to them, well, you can't patent
this, but have you guys thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing anything with data you're
accumulating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you guys have a huge amount of
data here that could be used for all sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, well, like,
for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, like, we're building breeding
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, oh, and so they were
like, well, but if we had to hire you to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how kind of it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is in, you know,
molecular genetics and biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, you know, Gene Jock, the whole mine
yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I was at the very forefront
of QPCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started QPCR, it was a stopwatch
and three different water baths at
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just lift your thing and, you know,
instead of having the thing cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've cycled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of the stuff that we
do in terms of our market designs like
[SPEAKER_00]: that is stuff that we have a very strong
foundation for because of either my
[SPEAKER_00]: background or the data that we had already
accumulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's kind of how it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of an accident, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went for one thing and then when they
realized that I actually had a vision for
[SPEAKER_00]: what they had already accumulated,
they were like, well, here, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: hire you to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of markers back then were you
guys able to identify?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the first CBD test in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and not only that,
but our CBD test was the first and for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while was the only one that actually
pinpointed the ultra high kind of ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, it was a greater than 20 to
one, like the ACDC class, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our marker was actually specific for
that class, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was significant because,
you know, it allowed you to start going
[SPEAKER_00]: down that farm bill ahead path,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started looking for like varying
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long row to hoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, Phylos did a better job
than us, but we felt it faced all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: turmoil at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we ended up in front range
and a whole bunch of stagnation kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but ironically, we found the BK AR
marker either around the same time or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little before anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just couldn't finish validating it
because literally we were in a spot where
[SPEAKER_00]: we were doing very little work because of
very little money and because we were also
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time kind of transitioning between
hemp and going back to the THC market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, you know, the company that I work
for, while it was a big hemp company is no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer hemp focused, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always that, you got to stop
and then pick up and save it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of that throughout our
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did the transition work from Steep
Hill to front range?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you guys were acquired by front
range at some point.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2019, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, and this kind of this was
forced by, you know, a change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When the BCC, well, the then BCC,
now DCC rules came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the nature of the game
changed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very hard for a testing lab making
slim margins to support a full on R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: program like we were, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time I probably had probably
eight or nine people and just my R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: program, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So front range had made an inquiry because
they were looking for that kind of being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to build markers and, you know,
having a science team to drive a science
[SPEAKER_00]: driven seed development company,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they talked to Steep Hill and there was
a deal made for, you know, some money and
[SPEAKER_00]: some stock and, you know, they got the IP
along with us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the front range and it was,
you know, like we hit the ground running,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, we already had the CBD
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already had a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had already had terping markers and
some other pathway markers that were
[SPEAKER_00]: already, you know, in development and or
either in development already validated,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they were at the time
front range was, you know, going down the
[SPEAKER_00]: same road everybody else was, which was
more CBD is more better, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want that higher CBD to THC ratio
and everything else be down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so, you know, we were able to get in
and start screening of their entire
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the first six months of
being there, we had screened everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and already had our first cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so happened that they were in
the process of getting to do seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seed increases so they could to
sell for the following year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we walked in and they already had
plants ready, pollen plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was a apply the screening
that we had done with our markers and then
[SPEAKER_00]: better designed the crosses that they were
going to do to be able to hit the marks
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the first seed stock that came
out, we already had hemp that was
[SPEAKER_00]: performing way better in terms of a number
of parameters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then that year we took all of that
stuff and we did the largest field trial
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp probably to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody's done it larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 27 locations around the United
States, including five university
[SPEAKER_00]: partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell was one of them and a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also went outside the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had five locations in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Columbia in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we literally went whole hog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had aerial flyovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collect multi-special data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, you know, phantom testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, you know, we had field agronomists
go out to all the sites and collect data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like literally we went whole hog
because if you guys using drone technology
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had fun in two locations and one
of our locations in Virginia and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: our locations in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used hyperspectral imaging to look at
fields.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drone stuff is just kind of mind
blowing for me still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we put together,
you know, I mean, you know, we designed a
[SPEAKER_00]: big ag type of model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to go out there and the only way you're
going to, you know, I mean, how often have
[SPEAKER_00]: you heard, well, yeah, I got shitty hemp
seed from I call this guy up and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he told me how great his
stuff was in his state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm in a different state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people can make
decent hemp seed for their one state,
[SPEAKER_00]: their one microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to have seed that is
successful in multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to put it there and grow it and
observe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to take good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the other thing that you need to
do is to figure out because of the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of hybridization and just mishmash
that, you know, some cannabis represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There there is is, you know, photo period
sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so some stuff when you put it in a
short day is not going to do as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: some other stuff and vice versa for for
short night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a huge undertaking,
cost a lot of money, and I was immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately taken to task by the company
for spending so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the but the next year, right,
when we sold our hemp seed, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody complained.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had any complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's unfortunately, at that point,
that was kind of twenty twenty one when
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry went right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have really better seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, marketing just doesn't work
anymore either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's there's a handful of
people producing really good seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a billion seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a while, people were just giving
the shit away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten cents a seed, five cents a seed,
a penny a seed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I spent the year before,
you know, a couple hundred grand running
[SPEAKER_00]: field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, you know, there's no way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you can justify why
your seeds are more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moving forward, that's what people are
going to have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only that only matters to some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some people are like, oh,
free seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good for like the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, that that's what
happened to a lot of people bought cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and then they realized why they
don't want to buy cheap seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or they failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of failure over the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of business is going under.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and California and Colorado,
you know, the production, the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: production is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the USDA numbers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they predicted that the hemp industry
would rebound by 2023 and you'd see an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had another twofold decrease in
the number of hemp acres from twenty
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty two to twenty twenty one to twenty
twenty two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So went from fifty four thousand acres to
twenty eight thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's that's the actual number of
hemp acres planted in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so I mean, you look around,
there's not a lot of a lot of those hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: companies don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, even some of the biggest
ones that you never thought would fail are
[SPEAKER_01]: gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can I can think of a few and
it's like it's it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think everyone was thinking it was
just going to grow, grow, grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genetic lines become the tragedy
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when people are looking to make
the most money, spend the least amount
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're not sure where they're
going to put their product anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is buying five dollar seed that
that even though if it's five percent CBC
[SPEAKER_00]: or makes, you know, five percent CBDV or
whatever these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually ends up being the secret to
making compliant hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more minor cannabinoids you have,
the less THC you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's been some interesting
cultivars created over the last five to 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think Gen Canna had a zero THC
that they were working on or had.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of companies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was Panakea, which was which was
zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a pure CBD, which was Oregon CBD
with that for one in both those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one was from hemp trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're in Spain or somewhere in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one was from from either
Sweden or Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Varen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys still working on that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's still a hot topic a
little bit, but it started about five
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBDV and THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have we have I mean,
we made cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to integrate it back into,
you know, everyday bud, because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: people got a little carried away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I have an eight to 10 percent
producer as well, but nobody wanted to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we're seeing is that
nobody has really adopted the Varen's in
[SPEAKER_00]: any edible products or things like it just
hasn't grabbed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the old days, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, German poison, right.
Had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were high one to one to two percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV and everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was a place for a good
quality, high THC bud with a couple to
[SPEAKER_00]: three percent THCV that I think is going
to be like a good daytime buzz,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of kicking in the pants
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we've been working on a couple of
varieties right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is purple, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had done some work with some red
Congo a while back and I had which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never tried it, red congos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends grow it in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super it's super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the Durban.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but but we used a red Congo base with
our THCV producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a few lines that are,
you know, between one to three percent
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV putting out, you know, twenty,
twenty two percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to see if I can bring back
Durban poison, dude, because I would love
[SPEAKER_01]: it if the real one came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of people that the
problem is, is a lot of people what they
[SPEAKER_01]: think is Durban poison is actually a
hybrid of Durban poison that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed with super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so everybody thinks is this
hazy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it's this musky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not hazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's extremely like licorice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we we grew up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I actually had a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read with that last year and I found
a cut that had that anise smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: that licorice smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so, yeah, so I'm I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to, you know, to start,
you know, going through that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm right with you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody keeps telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, that's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not it's got the
terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not the real Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's greenhouse that actually
we can blame Ariane and those guys over a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse for that, you know,
with the super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really interesting what most
people think of Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and same thing with red Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of red Congo that's not
the real stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, red beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's there's a handful of people in
northern California that actually sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: real red Congo, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to be careful with how much I
smoke of the red Congo, because it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those cultivars that doesn't really
have a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can keep getting more high and more
high and more high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you smoke, whereas a lot of the
modern, you know, the modern varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're smoking has like skittles has a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke skittles, you can only get so
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these, you know, and some of
these land race varieties, some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: African varieties, especially they just
have no ceiling and you can smoke more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just you know, they're almost
psychedelic, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ironically, you said that I got my red
Congo germplasm because I was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley area with the guys who were
growing the real red Congo back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saved every seed I ever got from
every ounce I ever bought from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's how I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I actually had one one of the
seeds that I popped from that red Congo
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I gave some cuts to a buddy of mine
who was what used to be a black market
[SPEAKER_00]: grower back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said he was he had people tell him
that it was like they were tripping on the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, what is this place,
dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I was like, no, dude, that's just
good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of that gives people like heart
palpitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it's almost gives you
an edible edible type effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for the faint of heart,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real red Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those African varieties are really
not for the faint of heart, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they they will push the blood
pressure up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will get the heart going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're more edgy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so but I like that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I like to feel like I'm jumping out
of my skin.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's like I like smoking this
stuff sometimes, not all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: not when I'm doing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that once where we were like
laughing too much during the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a reggae singer, a good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we we laughed pretty much for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a good time, but I think it
wasn't well received.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you guys are working on some modern
style genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, gelato is kind of hot and all
these gelato derivatives is that's mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: what we see in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so the whole chasing THC is really,
in my opinion, destroying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that whole thing kind of annoys
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought that I was going to buck
the trend and make something really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a few things that came out of
some of my right kind of crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is called Watusi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear to God, it's the best weed
anybody's ever smoked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but really, but it won't hit above
twenty two or twenty three percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody will buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like all these guys who have who are
cultivators for other companies have do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, well, you're not doing me
any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but no, but I learned the hard way,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't buck the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you're playing the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're doing the gases and we're
doing some of the candy and I got a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of purple shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so but it's you know, it's a little
disheartening that that you can't bring
[SPEAKER_00]: forth something that is a superior product
because it doesn't test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think market awareness is part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that education,
like we have an uneducated market and so
[SPEAKER_01]: they're really focused on hype,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these things will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like everything goes in waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the gas is coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some breeding with the shoreline and
with the Fort Collins cough and some blue
[SPEAKER_01]: dream stuff and some older genetics with
the hype stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some selections and found stuff
that has the look of what people want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with unique flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we hear now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have green flower again.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to be OK with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I see you see it more so in like
Washington than you do in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that market's a little more
educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with Colorado to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's interesting is that
everybody wants purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so purple anthocyanins are a less
efficient form of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant that's heavily purple will
always test less lower than a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: is equivalent pathway and green.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, yeah, you got to take into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have different versions of the
optimized pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have natural variation in
cannabinoid content anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but all things being equal,
if you had the same exact genetics in the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple plant, the green plant,
the green plant would always test higher
[SPEAKER_00]: because it makes more energy because it's
a better chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we as an industry are confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want high THC and we want high terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have the floral, the candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are GPP based terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: GPP makes THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a competition there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why the high THC varieties tend
to be more sesquiterpene heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a different precursor.
[SPEAKER_00]: FPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not in competition to make THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's as an industry, we're confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want things that you can't necessarily
have because the plant doesn't work that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The American dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I always want stuff we can't
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with education, I think these
things will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, like when we're doing pheno
hunting and we're going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: selection process, I try to give people
joints now because I want to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're I know what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm great at doing the selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about the taste and the
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it just kind of puts everybody
on the same page instead of giving people
[SPEAKER_01]: bags of flour, my friends bags of flour,
or guys we're working with bags of flour
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can try it however they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give them a joint, it's pre-rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's getting the same thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they don't get to look at the
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can identify if the color is the right
color or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could sit you in front of all of
the people that were naysaying me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, why do you guys need to see a
COA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why can't you guys take it,
smoke it, and then make a determination
[SPEAKER_00]: without seeing a number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it do you right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have the right experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it passes that, all those tests,
what the fuck do we care what percent TAC
[SPEAKER_00]: was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, when I was 12 or 13 years
old, you know, even 15 and 16 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking Pat on my red, I could Google
because that was the shit back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, none of that stuff ever tested
more than 12%, maybe 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even, even Sour Diesel, when I had it
tested at Halent in 2012, I had the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest testing outdoor Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have the COA, but it was only like
24% was the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the top that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, people, you know, and it was
amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Sour Diesel only tested 14%,
the stuff we were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so clearly we didn't need astronomical
TAC numbers to get a good experience out
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and the nature of cannabis is
changed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you had, you, if you,
you know, it's been a long time and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, you know, some of this is rose
colored memory, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but you know, you open up a bag
and, and they're of good weed and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a deep complex fragrance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get like a couple of notes because
literally you've only got a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes of which one or two are
significant content, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, when, when, when,
when the majority of weed is only one and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half, 1.2 to 1.8% terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we consider top shelf two and a half
percent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019, what was the grease monkey had 5%
terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I had stuff from outdoors this year
that had three and a half percent
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, so what, what are we doing
to ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't mean to derail the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a real interesting world we
live in, you know, and I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, like I was saying about the
education and I think market demand
[SPEAKER_01]: changes over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I remember stuff back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best stuff we had in the nineties was
the ugliest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this cat piss and the cat piss
looked like it was basically Brax in a bag
[SPEAKER_01]: and there, there might be some stems in
there, but it was sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, the one little gram of it would
smell your whole house up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it was $60 an eighth back
then straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no discounts on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would sell out and you wouldn't be able
to get it for a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's interesting about
that is that that brings up another point,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about, no, it took a lot of bag
appeal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things like cat piss,
baby shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so those are the, as far as we go in
terms of the almost, but not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: borderline unacceptable fragrance in our
wheat, right?
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, they're body odor, you know,
all these things that they're foul to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people, but then if as a
connoisseur, you like that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are 40,000 fucking terpies,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them smell really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them smell like vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, I mean, like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, and, and, and so I'm just left
thinking about through all of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause we've, we found,
you know, high THC cannabis going back
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,500 years and some ancient Chinese
emperors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so when did the selection against
really bad smelling cannabis start?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we, there's nothing that smells
really bad in cannabis, but there are all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of genes for terpenes that you would
expect to find, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In potentially in cannabis that,
you know, we have some borderline smells,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the cheese, which kind of,
you know, depending on what it's combined
[SPEAKER_00]: with smells like dirty feet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, you know, borderline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still see these as expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we call them out, you know,
but we're still seeing some funky stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even these menthol ones,
I don't, I don't particularly like
[SPEAKER_01]: menthol, you know, expressions in my
flower, but you know, I think there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting side to that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I had a cut of Mendo breath that,
um, no, no, it was called teach me
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a, as it was a strain from Oregon,
but it was, it was from the, it was from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendo breath line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, dude, it was straight up fucking
Bengay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally like the, like you broke
open the buds and it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were sniffing Bengay, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the weirdest smoke because it
gave you kind of like this almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: menthol flavor in your lungs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the weirdest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but, but, but it, it's cool because,
you know, the important thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that they, they kind of set
the body up for the experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the terpene profiles are really
important, much more important than I
[SPEAKER_00]: think people really understand sometimes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like certain terpenes, like certain
terpenes are actually having physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: effect in your biochemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like albopinene is an ACH inhibitor,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, which leads to increased focus,
increased energy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so literally there are these,
there is a biological reason why the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes do affect you the way they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we understood that better,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we'd be so much more in tune with
what terpenes do we have than how much THC
[SPEAKER_00]: do we have, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can have high THC weed with
very low terpenes and feel the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: lower THC weed with higher terpenes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then jumping into that, it's like the
conversation with indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like stimulant versus sedative
is a much better description these days
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything's so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually hyperdized, at one point
it made a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the one point you generally found
sativa is tall and lanky, always had a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of more uplifting cognitive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the short stocky ones generally
would make you couch lock and kind of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, stoner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not the case anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the sooner the people started
putting the tall and the short ones
[SPEAKER_00]: together and making babies, all went out
the window, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got one that looks like bubacush,
but it smells like a jacarer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a turpentine dominant then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of limonene and turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks like an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you were to take a picture of it
and put it in a book, people would think
[SPEAKER_01]: it was some Afganica indica variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what's interesting about this
is that, you know, and there are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like vestigial organs, you know,
like the ones you don't use anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actually a few vestigial terpene
families, right, that we found through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our work, which are very
interesting, that are are like the sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so literally it's a terpene gene
that has this set of minor terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are made out of the same gene that are all
strictly sativa, 3-carine, alpha
[SPEAKER_00]: phylandrine, all of these things that are
hard sativa kind of terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we found this one terpene gene
that made all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's literally like, well, yeah,
so we actually can sit like for a sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have this gene, we know it's going
to be that type of phenotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that level of understanding that
allows us to do really, really hardcore,
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive, bread for effect kind of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're not just phenohunting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting up crosses with a purpose
because we have known genes that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: known functions and we want to carry that
through to be able to achieve an effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That changes the nature of what we do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you can select for it or you
can not select for it because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: identified it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows people to actually start to
have more confidence when they pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: that pre-roll that says chill or energy,
you know, with that depth of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who can now offer those things
that will be a hundred percent spot on and
[SPEAKER_00]: people, the majority of people who,
you know, with the right ECS conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So because I have a few friends that
convince me that they are wired backwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: like stuff that makes everybody else jump
up and down puts them to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that puts everybody else to sleep
makes them jump up and down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure how that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what got messed up in those
people's endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, right, you can say
85 percent or better of the population
[SPEAKER_00]: will respond this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to question those people,
you'd be able to get responses that
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we start to cross over
from just cannabis as a potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, healing agent to a, yeah,
I can treat myself for various things,
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, whatever, because I understand
how this takes place in my biochemistry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anti-nose deception,
pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain chemicals in cannabis
that that do that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what they are.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to see where we are in five
years.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we're getting closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel is so, you know, they're further
ahead with us in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think we're definitely catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're definitely ahead on the
medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in terms of variety,
creation and just the new new,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the new hot shit,
I think we still have an edge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that compares to what
we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so many people,
you know, breeding and making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you could even call
breeding, but they're doing seed
[SPEAKER_01]: production, breeding, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making new genetics all over the
place, you know, on so many levels from
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy who's doing it at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like that over in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like drug discovery on the
medical side, you know, Mary, the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: he's doing over there, it's it's it's
pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to have a conversation
literally where daddy's name has not come
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's an awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does great work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but but but literally that he is the
epitome of making something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, applied academic research work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I met Daddy at this first kind of
tech.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when, you know, and he I became
friends since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and took me through his lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2013, 2014, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he already had cell lines,
immortalized cell lines, then he was
[SPEAKER_00]: already using, you know, extracts from
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, I mean, like, you know,
it's it's well planned, well thought out
[SPEAKER_00]: science in a regime where, yes,
let's consider this as medicine and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's just so much red tape,
less less red tape over in Israel than
[SPEAKER_01]: there is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, you know,
we're still having politicians argue
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it could be medical or not.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about autoflowers a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done some work with autoflowers
over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you guys working on autoflowers
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell us a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't our main focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It served two purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It served for us to be able to develop a
mapping population so that we could start
[SPEAKER_00]: to map that autoflower gene.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our flowering time genes in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a marker for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was actually ironically,
we never published on it because we drug
[SPEAKER_00]: dragging our feet and we wanted to do more
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we got scooped on it and we're
going to have to do more work to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to publish what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, so the F.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: gene that people are talking about now,
you know, we had a marker for it probably
[SPEAKER_00]: about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing more work with that marker to
kind of see what allelic variants there
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, and to kind of,
you know, I think what we didn't see far
[SPEAKER_00]: enough was we didn't anticipate that there
might be a tandem duplication like these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so now we know that there's,
you know, there's potentially a gene copy
[SPEAKER_00]: number component to flowering time strains
that only have one copy or longer
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering strings that had to copy our
fast flower, potentially autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to a while back use a combined
autoflower and varins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a bad choice in one of the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So USA Joe is, in fact, autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's a shitty plant to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It set me back over a year, like literally
set us back like a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and we were trying we were
trying to make autoflower CVDB basically.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of people working on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Nick Stromberg was doing some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nick goes back to Steve Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nick, we helped Nick way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the time, the only way to
detect THCV was through chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were the first lab to be able to
detect THCV, actually, Steve Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we worked with Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick and I go back a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick goes back along with Steve Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, you know, in fact, in fact,
at one point, I think he may have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with either Halent or us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had free reign.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to come in and run samples on our
machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he got his degree from Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people interested in
it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so we all had a connection to Doug
Jenks, who who was the guy who developed
[SPEAKER_00]: Doug's Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which was that the real first I think
talked about high, fairly high THCV that
[SPEAKER_00]: even back then it wasn't that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making like four to seven percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was a one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was making about four to seven
percent THC as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was it was a blast to smoke tasted
like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, dude, it hits you hard, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got some some extract that was
pure THCV that was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Nick, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting where all these
cannabinoids are going to go in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's there's so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBC has known, you know, uses the
Varens, you know, with the with because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not only like the president,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've already got I think it's in
mice models or rat models where they
[SPEAKER_00]: showed like diabetes type two,
like in a mouse model that that
[SPEAKER_00]: administration of THCV helps, you know,
regulate blood sugar and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so there's a lot of work that can be
done with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need as a country to get off our
fucking asses and accept the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not the demon that was made out to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of good uses and and and free
the plant and let us do some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you see the industry going in
the future, you know, over the next five
[SPEAKER_01]: years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have a pretty great
perspective from from the stuff you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on as far as genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought I did, but I but I I
don't do I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: James, let me tell you, like I had a
conversation with the CEO of my company
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday and saying, what the hell do we
need to do to get people to buy our weed?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, you know, the industry is a fickle
beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think where everybody everybody has
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
this is farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know nobody likes when I say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so an agriculture becomes commoditized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so at the end of the day, down the
line, people are going to be concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about their their cost to produce,
right, because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezed on margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are not the way that happens,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are the most expensive way to
cultivate cannabis that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why no big cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roses and some other ornamentals.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, most things that
are grown outdoors are most things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown in large greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the exception of things like coffee,
because every single coffee tree has a
[SPEAKER_00]: very different flavor profile.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but for the most part, you're you're
you're growing stuff from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not plant the seed yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may buy your germinated seeds and
little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but the cost, the cost to produce seed
is far cheaper than the cost to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where everybody will have to go is to
stabilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see because nobody is going to want to
throw out a thousand seed and get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 50 different varieties.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nobody wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so so further inbred stabilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetically stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can which with the the use of snip
chips that are being offered by my company
[SPEAKER_00]: and other companies with markers of the
breeding, you can make do some real damage
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can get some very directed kind of
corral germplasm populations to work with.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a much better chance of achieving
things that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the work begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either are going into an inbreeding
program so that you can now create F1
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids that are have the full,
you know, hybrid vigor that we see now
[SPEAKER_00]: when we throw things together and say,
oh, my God, that thing's fucking a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you just did the hybrid vigor
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and so I think that's one of the
things, but I think the other thing we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to see is, you know,
Darkheart was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manipulation Rest in peace, Darkheart.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, where you're starting to make
triploids so that people can't steal your
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll get to triploids in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I think some companies who ran
into it early did it wrong.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but then also the whole double haploid
breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are not in the spot where we
can take eight to 12 years to stabilize,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to get to an F8, F9,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we have, you know, greater than 90
percent of the seed looking the same when
[SPEAKER_00]: you when you throw them out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so double haploid breeding gets us,
you know, cuts that down to a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half, two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that includes actually true
type testing after the fact that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the right things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where everybody has to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more and more people will fail
because they're paying cutting fees on
[SPEAKER_00]: their clones, on their moms, or they're
having huge mother rooms so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have get enough cuts to be able to run
that 1400, you know, plants in that bay
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So or they're paying, you know,
a lot of money to companies like Node and
[SPEAKER_00]: Conception and, you know, for for clones,
you know, eight, ten dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: A clone or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the double haploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about double haploid a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the viewers that aren't familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So double haploid breeding is where you
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called anther culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take so you take whatever variety
and then if it's not a male already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you make it you make it produce anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take that answer and you those
answers and you culture them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: an ogre like tissue culture and you get
callous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, you know,
so now you got to remember that anthers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sex parts are haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not diploid in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you then take that callous and you
do somatic embryogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a regenerate from that,
just like you would from a regular tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture callous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except that because it came from anther
and not from a diploid tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a haploid tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a haploid plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can then take that haploid plant
and cross it back to itself.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That or or or across to some other haploid
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't if you don't cross it back to
yourself, then you're not really making
[SPEAKER_00]: the double haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just out crossing in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but you cross it back to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you end up with is a plant
that is 100 percent homozygous at every
[SPEAKER_00]: low side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that plant looks nothing like the
plant you took it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's now 100 percent homozygous
at every low side, the plant that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: using to was not 100 percent homozygous at
every low side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what you got to do is you got to go
through and you got to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations because you're not just doing
it with one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now that you've got these 100
percent homozygous lines that you created
[SPEAKER_00]: from this anther culture and remember,
every anther is the rule of independent
[SPEAKER_00]: disarmament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you get one genotype out
of an anther.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because so so there's still a
phenotyping marker assisted kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: selection to make sure you have the right
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you then breed those two 100
percent homozygous things together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with the best version of an F1
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's it and and you see the
kind of hybrid bigger that people refer to
[SPEAKER_00]: when they say F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we typically do in cannabis is not
really a true F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A true F1 hybrid is from inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So totally stable, stable lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so that's what double halfway
breeding allows you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to cut that inbred line
development, which takes a long time into
[SPEAKER_00]: a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a lot of evaluation that
has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because part of the inbred line process is
picking the best ones as you go down to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue doing the breeding with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've created this population of
haploid genomes that you're going to now
[SPEAKER_00]: make diploid by mating to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now have to look at, well,
what combinations did I get and how do I
[SPEAKER_00]: put those together to make good seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that seed that comes out is 100
percent identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in the same that population
from that next cross is 100 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you get you throw you throw
your thousand seed out there and nine
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred and ninety nine at the very least
are looking the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we need to get to,
to be able to really drive the price down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you get to that point,
you know, even if it's top notch seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you're going to be in bulk,
you're going to be paying a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: three bucks a seed as opposed to eight,
ten, twelve bucks a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then what are your thoughts on A.I.
[SPEAKER_01]: for predictive models and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So A.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: is good if you have good input data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so they try to do a lot of A.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they haven't had a lot of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had some success, but not a lot
because garbage equals garbage out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you have very well curated
terpene data and not everybody does the
[SPEAKER_00]: same job and the same thing for all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so A.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: has potential use, assuming you have good
input data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the way things have been going
in the industry with elevated numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth, I don't think there's
good data to be able to really to do any
[SPEAKER_00]: good A.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I who have in my my own data for my own
work, which is very well curated,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a data scientist whose job is
nothing but to tell me what is my good
[SPEAKER_00]: data, my shady data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even he is not at the point where he
thinks we have data that's sufficient for
[SPEAKER_00]: A.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling without heavy handholding of the
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so so I think it's I think it will get
there at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You either need a good amount of really
outstanding data or you need shit tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: poor data or mediocre data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to work through all of the
the the falsehoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so and I don't think there's and there
may be enough data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if every lab in the world got
together and dumped all their shit into a
[SPEAKER_00]: big repository and set some A.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: engine on it, it probably do a decent job.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but but but we're not at that level of
cooperation where everybody's just dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: all their data into a single repository.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're we're just starting to
scratch the surface with some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that was discovered describing
double haploid reading before I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bad mouthed triploid stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny because, you know,
a lot of people went and did triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because now you, you know,
you know, you won't get see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your shit didn't harm, you wouldn't
need triploid to take care of that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was another way to approach your
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't harm to, you know, and
traditionally, triploid are used at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of a breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and because now you've done all this
work, you have your inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're F1 hybrid seed is
going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you take one of those parents and
you make it a quadriploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring it to the diploid equipment,
the diploid version of it, and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: triploid seed that exhibits the exact
phenotypic stuff that you needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think anybody had weed of any
kind CBD or THC dominant that was at that
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the cycle breeding kind of path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so it was really used to solve a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have been solved other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my, that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're quite there with the
triploids yet, but I mean, the concept is
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great for watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's a great example,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so when you make triploids,
right, not so, you know, you either have
[SPEAKER_00]: complete triploids or, or partial
triploids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like for instance, you know,
Mac one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is, is a partial triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, and boy, was that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to agree with that and I could
never figure it out until I figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was a partial triploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why are 95% of all my seed immature
fucking duds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I would, I would harvest like a
thousand seed and like 50 would be good,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV is like that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at fruit, that's been
triploided, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not every trip, what is going to be
increased mass, better sweetness,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, you really have to make sure
that the triploid combination that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have is giving you something that you
want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, otherwise you just have a
triploid in the end and that's not making
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, but isn't really a better plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, the, the, the reason you use
triploid is to get something extra,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increased vigor, increased yield,
increased flavor, no seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The no seed part is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that's all you're using it for,
then you're kind of wasting the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be there eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably enough people working on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if we want to survive, you know,
I mean, I hate, I would hate to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: become the future of the cannabis
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm sure you've heard
people talk about how there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: this split in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have like the small craft
beer guy, and then you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the big box beer guy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that already happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think it's happened to a degree
already?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I personally think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of like to see it going that
way with terroir and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about Humboldt and
Mendocino, and these guys with their
[SPEAKER_01]: specific genetics that they grow that are
specific to that region and make it more
[SPEAKER_01]: like wine and beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as long as that model is well
regulated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just because, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't take some dirt from
Humboldt, go to LA and grow it in LA and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, this is Humboldt grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not because now temperature is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, insulation is different,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, so, remember, this was a
few years ago, they were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff and they want, you know,
for sure that they want to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir map of the Humboldt, you know,
and the Emerald Triangle up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they had asked me to
consult on that whole program,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I was with NCIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you guys don't want me to
consult because I'm going to ruin
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's party, dude, because you guys
want to be able to say, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, grow under license by this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, that's not,
that's not terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has nothing to do with it,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, terroir means you grow it in that
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your region and you can't grow it
outside that region, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you grow it outside that
region, it changes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you know, because terroir is
very, it's so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soil microbes, it's mineral content,
it's so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's humidity, elevation, all these things
come into play for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great idea if it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do it like they do provinces in
France for wine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like literally you can grow the same
grape in two provinces that are next to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there is, this is actually what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wine called Mecquen Village and
another wine called Pris Foussi,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally it's the same grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two places are next to each other on
the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they have a line down in the
middle and there is a slight difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, I think it's the acidity or some
mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this county has more of one
thing than this county does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different wines, can't call them the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had the same growing techniques in
two regions right next to each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: one that was up a little higher or lower,
you're going to get different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this leads to something else,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why brand names need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know nobody's going to like to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but it's based on what you just said,
the chemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take blue dream and you grow it up
and humbled and you grow it in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you expect to have the same chemical
output?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's phenotype is equal to
genotype plus environment.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally blue dream may not look like
blue dream if it's grown in two different
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you'll get a different
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then besides that, it's like,
so these guys are selling packs of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These retailers, including myself,
but you're, you're selling a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and somebody pops one and they call it
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone pops another one from
that same pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also call it blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a different expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dreams is a bad example because it's
a little more stabilized, but like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of this gelato, you know, cause blue
dream, you get basically with the S ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting four expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lean towards one of these four
expressions, but with something like
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato 33, you put it, yes, you self
gelato 33, you pop 10 seeds, you get 10
[SPEAKER_01]: different expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pop 20 seeds, you're probably going to
get 20 different expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's, and that's the problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, you know, so don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say it's a problem,
but it's a challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also what leads to such amazing
diversity that we see everybody's always
[SPEAKER_00]: got every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something new coming out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so it helps us in a way,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, we, we have to be careful about
whether or not we're over hybridizing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll eventually lose distinctions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how, how, how many bakery products do
we need, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, how many ice creams do we
need, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, and, and they're all made by
banging the same plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where we start to have
problems with, you know, genetics and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these, we're not, we don't study
this kind of stuff because nobody really
[SPEAKER_00]: studies anything to any depth in,
in, in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we do, you know, too busy trying to
make money, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but how much inbreeding depression
have we already seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's contributing to some of these
hard to grow strains and hard to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: strains because right, literally we have
been banging the same shit together over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over and over and over again.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like hoplite and Viroid,
you know, I think, yeah, hoplite and
[SPEAKER_01]: Viroid has been a hot topic for the last
couple of years, but especially now it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's decimating some people and
it's, you know, it might express on a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might express on a plant or a row or a
whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, and that's a problem,
but I mean, I think, and correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, but, uh, you know, with,
with all this genetic depression that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on from inbreeding, I mean,
a lot of people don't think they're
[SPEAKER_01]: inbreeding, they're crossing this with
that, but then the plants more susceptible
[SPEAKER_01]: to things like hoplite and Viroid and
different pests and other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some evidence that different
cannabis lineages have different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to hoplite and Viroid,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think anybody's got a real
handle on it, but you know, but we we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done a lot of work with it and we've,
we've actually, you know, at one point
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were a hemp company, we,
we, we were running a, a cleaning program
[SPEAKER_00]: where we would, you know, we had some of
our varieties that we were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we put them into our tissue culture
program and, and actually ran,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some thermal cleaning protocols
and we're able to show significant
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases in the level of hoplite and
Viroid after one cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, one of the, one of the lines was 75%
reduced, one was 60%, another one was like
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% and there were some lines you could
not clean at all, at all, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so clearly there are genetic
differences that if we understood better,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could in fact work with to produce more
resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether that resistance is due to
like a, a pathogen kind of gene or whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because it's producing certain
terpenes or not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it, and remember terpenes are in fact
the kind of the plant's immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely an avenue that we,
we should be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the way you're saying it is,
is are we seeing less resistance to HPLVD
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have been doing all of this
damage to the genetics through inbreeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question and I don't know
if anybody's ever thought of it that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more we've started to focus on the
gelatos or the gorilla glues and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies and breeding those lines,
suddenly we're seeing this increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost, it's almost like it's
occurring at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I don't know for sure that
there's any support for that, it certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: fits the available observation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely seems to be a
correlation between, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been a much bigger spike,
but you could also potentially attribute
[SPEAKER_00]: that much bigger spike to the now it's
legal in so many states, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when, when my company licensed Panakea
from hemp trading in Spain, the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we did when we got the cuts was run
HPLVD tests on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to us from Spain with HPLVD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's transmissible through clones and
even seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're, they're proving that,
you know, now that it's transmissible
[SPEAKER_01]: through seed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so do they change that number?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read up on that recently,
but the last time I heard it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to 10% transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it still that low or,
or they are people?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've heard is I've heard eight
to 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is still a good percent,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so that means if you, if you're
dealing with two infected plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means one out of every 10 seeds has
the potential to start bad, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, that's not good.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think a lot of people aren't
testing for it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just assuming and,
you know, ignoring it and something that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be identified and.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's another thing
with awareness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people, you know, they start
seeing, and the thing is, is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cultivators, they see it on one
branch, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see it on one, you got a dotted
branch, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you start seeing dotted plants and
you have to cull those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, and it can, it's funny
because unless you're using bleach to
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilize your tools, if you have it in
your room, you're just going to spread it
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with, with irrigation, if you're,
if it's passing through the water from one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to the next, you could spread it
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then, and what was it,
Kevin, from, just two days ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the paper that leaf hoppers are
carriers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they found the virus, the virus in the
leaf hopper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, and so think about this though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main mode of transmission
previously was mechanical, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You snip a plant, you don't wash them
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You snip another plant, bang, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, who's washing the man little parts
of the insects to eat, bite in our plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you find it on leaf hoppers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what about all the other plants that
happily munch on cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a virus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it has to go in and infect
and then get protein coat and then lice
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally an RNA, an infectious RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets in if it, you know, through some
sort of mechanical transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a bug is on a dirty plant and hops
to a clean plant and bites that clean
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, why wouldn't its mandibles or,
or proboscis or whatever it's sticking in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to eat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why wouldn't it potentially have the same
ability to transfer that the scissors that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using to cut do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and before there was no bona fide
insect, you know, transmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that at least there's one,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's time to keep our eyes open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow, I grow, I, I grow a tortoise dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find, I find crickets like huge
crickets, like happily munching on my
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, can crickets carry it too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it bites a bad plant, will it
transmit to a good plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think if you have a tissue
culture lab, if you're, if you're blessed
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to be a cultivator that has a
tissue culture lab and you can keep clean
[SPEAKER_01]: germplasm, you know, it's, it's going to
make a huge difference moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with apical biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apical biotech from Justin from apical
biotech and they, they do remediation and
[SPEAKER_01]: they do a really good job with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they have, they have tests
that prove that they're actually remedying
[SPEAKER_01]: with mere stem excision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much misinformation,
disinformation and lack of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to change that so drastically,
so drastically, you know, in order to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we want to be legitimate,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be a self-sustaining industry
that doesn't have every year more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: people dropping out because they're losing
their shirts because something with
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations or something with,
you know, finance or whatever is kicking
[SPEAKER_00]: their ass, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm speaking from personal experience
right now, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the wild, wild west still,
but it's evolving and it's growing in some
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think it's stabilizing in
other ways, which I think is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, once again, let's celebrate that,
that one step closer to safe banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, that that's going to make so much
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went, we went back a couple of years
back and we started doing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: land-raised stuff like packets and it's a
job Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dude, let me tell you the stuff that we
started to get out of that, the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles and just, just amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's something to be said
for the old school genetics, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, land races, old school genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some power back there still.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now with like Thailand opening up
and Asia opening up, there's a whole new
[SPEAKER_01]: group of terpenes that we can start going
after and flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you talk about, you know, green tea ice
cream or fried chicken, fried chicken,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people don't want to smoke stuff that
smells like fried chicken, but you take it
[SPEAKER_01]: over there and they like savory more than
sweet, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, South Korea goes online.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have some kimchi cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's been such a
bottleneck in US genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I'm geeky this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started to create a chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using the seedfinder.eu.com,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started to go back and I started to
make a chart of like all of the crosses of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that was popular today,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, GG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when these are just said crosses,
I think a lot of people, I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people take the data on seedfinder as
fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know for a fact, a lot of it is
incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because somebody says it's one thing
doesn't necessarily mean it isn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still there's a lot of information
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go, when you take a lot of
the, of the, of the current genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to go back to grandparents,
great grandparents, dude, you were all at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally it all came from like six
or eight different varieties created,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like the thousands of varieties we
have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it's, it's the,
um, Durbin was one of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, so the, the Durbin self was,
was one was a big parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Afghani that went into the early
cookies, like literally dude, like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cushion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's, there's a lot,
there's a lot of similarity in what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Reggie, if people want to, find out
more about you, what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: where can they find you online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, um, so it's, uh, it's rgdino at front
range bio.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I was told that our, our website no
longer works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go to our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, but just, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just Reg, rgdino, r-g-a-u-d-i-n-o at
front range bio.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to answer questions if
anybody has any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same day, but I always get back to
people who ask me these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an Instagram or social media,
or you avoid that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to avoid it like a plague,
but I do have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dr. Reggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Dino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All, all one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and there's not much on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do have some pictures of,
of, uh, my last breeding harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which where I went, uh, I found a
really amazing cut of strawberry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this really sweet kerosene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and I went nuts with that sucker,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read it to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, so I have, yeah, when you find a
good one, that's the best way to approach
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, so, so I have a few
pictures and some stuff, some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes out of FRB, cause I'm not a big
Instagram, but I'm not a big social media
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, when I'm, when I am reminded by
the company to push it on my Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few things of some related
stuff, but, um, yeah, that's where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much and have a
wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care guys.
Cheers.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
