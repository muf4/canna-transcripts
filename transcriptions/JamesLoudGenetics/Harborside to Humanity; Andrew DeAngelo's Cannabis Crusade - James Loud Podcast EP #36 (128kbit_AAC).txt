[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, my special guest is Andrew D
'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Andrew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm great, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me into your beautiful
studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Andrew, you have a long history with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and your brother, Steve, founded a
bunch of projects and ventures like
[SPEAKER_00]: Harborside, but you go back into cannabis
even further than that, I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I've read some stuff about you
acting years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm proud to say 2023 is my 40th
anniversary in the cannabis trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started in high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in those days, we were underground,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my brother and I started working
that market and did it pretty well in our
[SPEAKER_03]: hometown, Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my brother had an old friend out in
San Francisco named Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dennis Perrone was working to legalize
medical out here, first in the city of San
[SPEAKER_03]: Francisco in 92 and then statewide in 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in those days, your listeners might not
know, but there was a little split in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us split it over into industrial
hemp because Jack Herrera's book had just
[SPEAKER_03]: been published.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, oh, wow, we can make all
this stuff out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start a hemp company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So me and my brother started a hemp
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then cats like Dennis Perrone was
like, no, no, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start the medical cannabis
revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turns out Dennis was right and we were
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually, you know, because we had a
robust wholesale business underground,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were able to send Dennis a bunch of
money for those initiatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned me being an actor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in acting school here in San
Francisco when those initiatives were
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would buy and sell cannabis to
Dennis because he was basically the only
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary in the world at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had opened up different storefronts
and different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that one of the first ones was
above the transfer bar on Market Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a little gay bar, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there at the Muni stop, right in
front of the Safeway there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And above, there was like this space and
Dennis rented that space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could fit, I don't know,
50 or 100 people in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was always packed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they would buzz you in.
[SPEAKER_03]: In those days, you'd get buzzed in to the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and everybody, Dennis,
my brother and I, everybody, a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people in the movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say everybody, but a lot of people
in the movement want it to get legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were tired of getting busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis had gotten badly busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother got busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not yet gotten busted at that point,
but I have, of course, a couple arrests in
[SPEAKER_03]: my career, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't like hiding from the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't like being criminals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't like getting chased by cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a really hard way to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once we legalized in California,
my brother and I did the same thing in our
[SPEAKER_03]: hometown in Washington, D.C., two years
later, 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal government would not allow us
to implement that law.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the District of Columbia works,
the federal government funds the District
[SPEAKER_03]: of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would not appropriate the funds to
implement the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and then a year or two after that,
my brother got busted really badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we knew it was time that we
had to leave our hometown and come out to
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: My acting career was going pretty good in
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there came a split in the road for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was no way that I could
act more than a full time job.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and cannabis is more than a full
time job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just brutally hard professions
that require, you know, 18 hour days being
[SPEAKER_03]: on all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I realized I was also getting,
you know, Hollywood's a very young town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, once you get approaching 30,
if you haven't made it yet, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to start thinking about different
ways to be a storyteller, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so and, you know, we had had this bust
and my parents were elderly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to take care of my family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that was the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we started at Harborside in 06.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was a medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we'll talk a little bit more
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then those days, there were no
labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were no investment groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were no packaging companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started all those as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Arcview Groups, Deep Hill Labs,
Cantaline Packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: To try to create infrastructure for the
industry to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: In those days, the city of Oakland and
most places in the state were barely
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: They certainly weren't licensing growers
and breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, those folks are still
getting busted, you know, by the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: by the feds all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we wanted to build that
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew the day was going to come where
lab testing of a cannabis was going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to happen just to make things
copacetic with the general public for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that elected officials or
politicians were going to need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to pioneer these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with the child resistant
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Harborside and other of
those first movers that did well,
[SPEAKER_03]: we didn't have any, couldn't raise any
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a nonprofit model during the
medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you go to investor and like
nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, bye bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got other places to put our money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like the nonprofit model because it
really served our community well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growers and breeders and traders and
transporters and manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had most of the products on
Harborside's shelf in those early years
[SPEAKER_03]: came from very small businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: People that were making stuff in their
kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boutique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very boutique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was high quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we didn't put anything on ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't, you know, 90% of what came
in the purchasing door got rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we would also give feedback to folks
so they can improve and get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, when you tell somebody,
no, they get a little upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to say, hey, we think if you did
this, that or the other, you could improve
[SPEAKER_03]: your products to the point where we could
feel good about buying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd even go to people's farms,
you know, and give them pointers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some brewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had brilliant, brilliant subject matter
experts that we hired that ran that whole
[SPEAKER_03]: department.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was Harborside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, the adult use
framework came along a long time after
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that framework, of course,
is much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had a big impact on everybody in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the early days of Harborside,
you guys had like the boutique Walmart of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wild experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys also put a lot of money back
into the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys had massages and you had other
things that, you know, a lot of places
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free massages, free, you know,
and free education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you guys were educating people
for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the quality of the products,
I mean, you guys had really good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: flour right from the get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember the sage and sour that you
guys had was the best sage and sour I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it came from a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think a lot of people think of
it the opposite now where the craft stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the opposite now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause all those folks had to go
underground because they couldn't comply
[SPEAKER_03]: with the 64 framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people tried to comply and
failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they went back underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, you and I know this,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got one foot in both markets and
that's how they've managed to survive this
[SPEAKER_03]: framework, which is really broken in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really sad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tragic, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tragic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like the whole let's reschedule
instead of deschedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole, you know, it's
unbelievable that we're even having this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, descheduling is the obvious choice
for anybody on the policy spectrum,
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you're just a hardcore
prohibitionist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the science is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The studies are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of proof.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear the elected officials,
especially at the national level say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, we got to study it more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't studied it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's been studied more than cannabis in
the whole world?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can think of very few things
that have been studied more than cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe petroleum or mining or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been a very difficult road and a
lot of people could make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And folks are not going to just let their
businesses die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're able to, they're going to play
in both markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are doing that in
California right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going to do whatever it
takes to survive at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't get too famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't come on James show if you're doing
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: All eyes on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's really interesting the
uphill battle from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the early days to where it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long, long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting because I feel
like the general consensus, if you ask
[SPEAKER_00]: people all over the United States is more
than 50% are OK with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're at 65% for adult and 95% for
medical in the polls right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's hard to argue the medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest thing is like,
I don't get that 5% are just bad people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want people healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a lot of stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they still feel that the getting high
part is more harmful than the medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're just super conservative
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mainstream population of the United
States is pretty conservative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to do a good job policing
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it be how we brand our
products, make sure that they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: appealing to kids or they're not knocking
off other mainstream products that are in
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a recipe for disaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: For everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's all kinds of ways to tell
our stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our stories are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're phenomenal stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people live the kind of life we
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people take the kind of risk we
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people have the adventures we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experiences, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experiences, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a very rich life to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we that are in that bubble,
we have to be mindful that it is a bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the folks outside of it have a lot of
concerns, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been all over this country building
dispensaries and grows and other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the local people really still have a
hard time with this, OK, in most places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems absurd to us because it feels
like we've just been educating and
[SPEAKER_03]: educating and educating for years and
years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we just have to stay on that and make
sure that we're not just policing
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves, but providing good,
solid information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't know how you feel about
it, James, but the consumer seems very
[SPEAKER_03]: confused to me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the markets aren't stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, California, especially me
being from California, but also I work in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and I go to Colorado quite
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those markets a little more mature
than California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a trust with brands more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like we need to get that trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Californians, we need to get that trust
with our consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think running it like a real
business is one thing, but also having
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality product so they can have a
reliable source they can go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think those things are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also just running these things like
real businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what's going to make the
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And professionalism goes a very long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being excellent is when I look at
your facility here, it's been you've cared
[SPEAKER_03]: for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've put a lot of effort into making it
look and feel and be excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as we do that, we're going to
be OK, because the baseline in the
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstream society is not excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can count on a few hands,
amazing experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple stores are perhaps one of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sell it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They spent tens of millions of dollars on
the Apple stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lucky enough to have one of their
leaders who did that in my consulting
[SPEAKER_03]: co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we can create experiences that
allow people to say, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they get home and they hit
the weed or they take the edible or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pre-roll and it tastes amazing and it
gives you a great effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just my thing is I love the
pre-roll because you're not looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at it from a taste
perspective and you're looking at it from
[SPEAKER_00]: an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get rid of the hype to a
lot of the degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the ugliest, but in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it tastes great, if it gives you a
good effect, that's really what counts at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's about the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start talking about experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that because I feel like
cannabis is such a great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anymore, you used to be able to get by
by giving people immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mediocre experience with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to get people high pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grew stuff that got people
high, you were OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to have the best shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to survive, you have to have
some of the best cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter whether you're black
market or white market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in rec, you have to grow the
best stuff because the price is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: lower that to be in that upper echelon,
you got to grow quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's always room at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always room for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that one percent rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you fit into that one percent,
you're going to be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that almost transcends everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I work really hard with my
clients on is let's get to that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take more time to get to
that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably going to take more resources
to get to that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you get to that level,
when headwinds occur in the market because
[SPEAKER_03]: the supply chains are fragile and they're
being, you know, you're building them
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're flying the airplane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Airplanes crash when you're building them
and flying them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those market headwinds,
if you're at that top one percent and
[SPEAKER_03]: people just are loyal to your product,
they might buy a little less of it during
[SPEAKER_03]: hard economic times and supplement their
purchase with something that's more value
[SPEAKER_03]: centered.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they will not abandon you ever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned being a stoner, I'm sure
you've learned it, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always want to put the best cannabis in
our bodies that we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will search long and far to get to get
something that really pops.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what and when more and more
people become cannabis enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_03]: that same dynamics going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to want something that
really pops eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, once you get on that spectrum
and you go from cannabis curious to full
[SPEAKER_03]: on stoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you then you're like, OK,
let's let's see what what what I can do
[SPEAKER_03]: with this a little bit more on the quality
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's just like with everything,
I feel like data points as you've
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced it more, the more times you've
tried cannabis or food, you really learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about yourself and what you like and
what you don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what's going on in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, it's like they go on Instagram
or social media and they see these brands
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like, oh, yeah, that must be
good because it's Snoop Dogg's or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not saying anything bad
about Snoop Dogg's brand, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: people are attracted to hip hop or to
things that they can relate to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they associate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you need to try several
different things, figure out what's right
[SPEAKER_00]: for you, what kind of experience you want
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't you have fun with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly try the celebrity
brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't meet your expectation,
you should let them know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all these celebrity brands are
licensing deals, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: The celebrity is not in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoop's not actually trimming this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably smoking it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should hope so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he's smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if to say go back to the drawing
board, this doesn't deserve to have my
[SPEAKER_03]: name on it, which may happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But check out the craft growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out the craft cannabis because one,
it's a community that deserves support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is worthy of abundance.
[SPEAKER_03]: They carried this plant through thick and
thin for a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to honor and respect that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus they grow great weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they create great products and it
doesn't have a bunch of fancy flashy
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not have an in-store display.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might not be able to buy a shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But dig around a little bit because it's
not hard to find these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get now there's Sun and Earth
certified products that David Bronner has
[SPEAKER_03]: that program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that goes beyond organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you really want cleaning cannabis,
check out Sun and Earth certified
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to get our act together
in terms of providing differentiation in
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketplace between craft and
celebrity and also bigger companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: scaled companies like Glasshouse or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then we go into terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that excites me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, cause I see what's
been done in the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis, we've talked about
it for years, but really it's going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to happen where you're going to
be able to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to see that as a
vertically integrated model where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to the guy who grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear about his, you know,
his parents who maybe grew it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can tell you the story of why it's
grown and why it tastes like it tastes and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think that's just such a
beautiful thing that this is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy that these people will be leaving
to their children potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a legacy for the giants that came
before us in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting to see the folks up in
Humboldt Mendo in that community diversify
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're starting to see glamping models
on farms now where you can go glamp and
[SPEAKER_03]: cut weed and consume weed and be with weed
and be in a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get much more beautiful than
Humboldt or Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the whole world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the hospitality models are going
to be big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like wineries, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wineries, they have two ways that they
have three basic revenue streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is they sell wine in bulk to
distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The alcohol industry has this three tiered
system, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're either a producer, you're a
distributor, or you're a retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't be, you can only be one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're a producer, you can sell
direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: At your winery to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the second revenue stream they
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the third revenue stream is just,
you know, all the extras that come with
[SPEAKER_03]: the experience of the tasting room or,
you know, some places do tours,
[SPEAKER_03]: some places do the glamping, some places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really some places have a little
food, a little bit of snacks, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think what we've seen with wine
tasting is an excellent model for and
[SPEAKER_03]: terrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm a big fan of Swami Select.
[SPEAKER_03]: Swami Select is, you know, and he grows in
Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he grows in the terrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually puts his plants in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not on a, they're not in a pot
with a bunch of soil he brings from the
[SPEAKER_03]: outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: He regenerates that land.
[SPEAKER_03]: He puts this, you know, the mycelium in
there and he just creates the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're close in Mendo and Humboldt to
getting that done.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been working on it for a few years
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of constraints and issues
with that program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a lot further along now than it
was three or four years ago when people
[SPEAKER_03]: were first starting to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one of the constraints is a
lot of that land up there wouldn't pass
[SPEAKER_03]: the lab tests if you put plants directly
into the land because it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: dirty or it has heavy metals in it or it's
been farmed or it's been logged or it's
[SPEAKER_03]: been whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some work that needs to be done
to remediate that because the Appalachian,
[SPEAKER_03]: for me, the Appalachian thing doesn't work
unless you're planting in the actual
[SPEAKER_03]: ground and soil of the region.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've done a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's all these tiny little
Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all next to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been named.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been mapped for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: That took years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all trying to get the community
again up there, the craft producers,
[SPEAKER_03]: to have something that differentiates
themselves.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a big company like my former
company now called State House or Glass
[SPEAKER_03]: House, they're all called house for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't grow that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't grow that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would never grow that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they'll never get an Appalachian
designation on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if the consumer starts digging
this, just like the wine people,
[SPEAKER_03]: Bordeaux, Bordeaux is Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bordeaux is Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't come from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be Cabernet Zignon,
Merlot, and Cab Franc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very strict rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very strict rules, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's served them well to have those strict
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's how other industries,
and I don't really like comparing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: to alcohol very often, but I do see,
we're in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about California.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wine industry is a dominant industry
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be top five industries in the
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to find these models because
we're building something from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never been a hundred years of prohibition
is a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no muscle memory.
[SPEAKER_03]: There isn't anyone alive who was around
who could go into a drug store in San Jose
[SPEAKER_03]: in 1910 and buy a cannabis tincture.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just nobody that's around that
could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's up to us really to pioneer all of
this and protect ourselves at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one of the things we've certainly
seen is the colonization of California
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in a big way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that has been one of
the more painful parts of the adult use
[SPEAKER_03]: framework for everybody, certainly for me
and my family, but for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever advantages we can get,
we should create for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the Last Prisoner
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good friends with Rich DeLisi.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve's been on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to get your history of Last
Prisoner Project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my brother came to me one day with a
vision like he does with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it with Harbor Side.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it with all kinds of things in our
lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a great vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were still in the last year or two of
our Harbor Side journey, but we could see
[SPEAKER_03]: that things were getting very
transactional in California and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: effed up with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to get back to our roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at Harbor Side, one of the free
programs we had, you could write a letter
[SPEAKER_03]: to a cannabis prisoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in exchange for that, we give you a
free green light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, one of my earliest memories
with cannabis is visiting my older brother
[SPEAKER_03]: in prison when I was nine years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have this history and this roots
with cannabis prisoners, me and my
[SPEAKER_03]: brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we wanted to get back to that,
we wanted to do something that was
[SPEAKER_03]: transcends transactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had people that were still locked
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my brother got the idea because
one of our friends was locked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was locked up in Pennsylvania and
called him from prison in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_03]: big investor meeting he was having.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the contrast between these investors
talking about, you know, billions of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars worth of weed, cultivate it and
transport it and sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chuck, our friend, he was,
I think it was 16 pounds or something he
[SPEAKER_03]: was in prison for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that contrast was like, we got to do
something about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Last Prisoner Project is a,
it started about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother and I, you know, he came to me
with the vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, yes, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we got to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what you need when you build
out an organization like that is you need
[SPEAKER_03]: a great team, you need money, and you need
a really tight mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also need ongoing support,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We started LPP with our own money,
but that was not sustainable given what
[SPEAKER_03]: was happening with Harborside and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought of different programs to
fund it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put together a team of people from our
network that we loved and thought were
[SPEAKER_03]: terrific, pretty much all women.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to work and the first year too
was brutally hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost had to fold the organization on
more than one occasion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then 420 happened during the pandemic,
2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did a fundraiser for that with Weed
Maps and some other folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was big.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people saw it, Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did several fundraisers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we introduced these programs,
Roll It Up for Justice and Partners for
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll It Up for Justice is dispensaries can
sign up for that program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the change that customers have,
50 cents, 20 cents, whatever the change is
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end of the transaction,
gets donated to LPP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't cost the dispensary any money,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they put a little bucket by the
register and the change goes in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's digital on the POS system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutchie is our partner with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're matching dollar for dollar,
or they were, I think they still are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that exposure we had at 420,
2020 and announcing those programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our business development team hit
the streets after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started to sign people up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even have to hit the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would call us up and say,
how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the industry was one of those ideas my
brother had that everyone in the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: industry just said, yes, this is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to relate to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let's get our people out of
prison, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weave's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in federal lockup, I think it's 3,000
or 2,900, something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: State lockup, a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked to a young man who served
seven years in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: Illinois is legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why is this guy still in prison?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got some of the biggest MSOs based
in Illinois, based in Chicago,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this guy's sitting in prison for
seven, eight years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a moral call.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a moral shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a call to action.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a moral call to action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm proud to say, even during a very
difficult moment, and I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: that our donations haven't gone down a
little bit in the last year, but all
[SPEAKER_03]: things considered, the industry's really
supported LPP.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody out there wants to,
you just go to lastprisonerproject.org
[SPEAKER_03]: slash get involved and you can learn about
the programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you can do a letter writing
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like we had at Harvard side,
we we've transferred that program over to
[SPEAKER_03]: LPP.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a freeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to give any money.
[SPEAKER_03]: For your listeners who have never been
locked up, when you're locked up,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially during real time, years in
prison, letters are a lifeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are a lifeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll really help people's day because
prison is something you survive minute to
[SPEAKER_03]: minute, hour to hour, day to day,
week to week.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very hard thing to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting a letter from somebody that's
encouraging you and saying, hang in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fighting for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your head up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a lifeline for people that are
locked up in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how people can get involved in
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just grateful to the cannabis
community for being so supportive of Last
[SPEAKER_03]: Prisoner Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing what you guys have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just I'm blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Richard was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his stories are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just he was the longest
serving prisoner, I think, that we got
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was 36 years or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirty six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Michael Thompson was also a long
serving prisoner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was 28 or 29.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the Lord's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant teaches us this.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least taught me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time we met was at the
Harborside Farms with Short Brooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought Ed Rosenthal to the farm to take
pictures and I got him so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just got my Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's like, well, can I use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits in the cup holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole time Ed's smoking the
Puffco on the way down on the way down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good two hour drive,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ed's smoking the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets there and he's like almost
comatose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, good old Ed with a big smile on
his face going there to take photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Short wasn't really happy with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we got some good photos in and
you guys had a beautiful farm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about Harborside Farms,
you know, how that got started and then
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've always been traders of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother and I, we weren't growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was 2012 or maybe a couple
of years after that, the city of San Jose,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we had a very popular shop,
changed their framework and they required
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone to be vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They required everyone to be vertically
integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't want to give up that shop and
we started trying to figure out how we can
[SPEAKER_03]: become vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it led us to Harborside Farms,
what's now called Harborside Farms in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, there was not a single
cannabis farm in that entire valley.
And.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, again, Steve and Harborside were
pioneering something in a place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too bad we couldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a bunch of farms around there and
then flipped them to some of the bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: players that are down there now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but we were we were first down there
and and we had to raise money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we had to raise money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive to grow cannabis in
greenhouses or indoors when they require
[SPEAKER_00]: you to retrofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember right, it wasn't like you
could do new buildouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be retrofitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't do new buildouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you had to get permission for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we eventually were able to build a
Dutch style Venlo greenhouse there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when you guys were building
them, they looked awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What our investors wanted to do was a
little different than what we wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very interested in scale and we
were more oriented towards craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought maybe, you know, the
opportunity down there was to to be almost
[SPEAKER_03]: more of a nursery because we didn't need
that much weed for our own shops that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a gigantic facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one area we diverged from our
investors a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when we got shored down
there, the farm was struggling,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, that little piece of land
is just inside the fog belt down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have a lot of issues with PM
down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powdery mildew, for those that don't know
what PM is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and we we struggled with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we struggled with it for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that was the impetus for
getting the Venlo was you control that a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the farm, like all farms,
the first year or two, we struggled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it got better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Harborside Farms, you know,
is now Statehouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Statehouse is a big company where several
different companies, Harborside,
[SPEAKER_03]: Urban Leaf, Sublime, Loud Pack,
all came together and formed a bigger,
[SPEAKER_03]: even bigger company.
[SPEAKER_03]: By that time, we had left Steve and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and now all those brands that are
within Loud Pack or Sublime or I think
[SPEAKER_03]: Dimebag is another one they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harborside Farms produces all of that for
those brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they put those brands on the
shelf of their stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I think we have 15 stores throughout
the state now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what Harborside Farms has
become now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Shores is not with us down
there anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: He he he he definitely turned things
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was there for a couple of years
and and then he moved on to other
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's doing some preservation work
right now with, you know, old school
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's at a place in his career
where he can have more autonomy of what he
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to do, because.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very good at what he does as a as a
farmer and he gets paid very well,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he's done well and now he can
do what he wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and good for him, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love short short and his whole crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I feel very grateful and
blessed that they were with us for as long
[SPEAKER_03]: as they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm friends with all the guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you guys have started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started in California, but you're also
working in New York and all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a consultant.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so that's how I make a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: LPP last person project is a volunteer
job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Harborside doesn't pay me anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so that's how I make a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I have a passion for
building things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love building.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed you've just built something
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really fun to build things and
then to see them come to life and to see
[SPEAKER_03]: the ideas and visions leap off of paper
into reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it's even more fun
when you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, OK, we plan that
correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to redo anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can just practice our craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so that's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mainly known for dispensary build outs
and consulting for people to get
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like to be there as close to the
beginning when the entrepreneur decides to
[SPEAKER_03]: either start up a dispensary or fix the
one they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do both of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've consulted with grows and
manufacturers to I have a co-op model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got folks like that in the co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even have industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to build a lot of industrial
hemp models that transcend cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: that are food and fiber based and
hempcrete and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a big future in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we're going that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just an obvious direction to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, the cost benefit for one thing
is huge, but also it's better for the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, obviously, we love cannabis
and we love the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely better for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's kind of a big deal
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, entrepreneurs that want to
get a hold of me for help, just reach out
[SPEAKER_03]: to andrewdangelo.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's all kinds of buttons on
there that will get you an email to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's a real passion I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I like about consulting is unlike
Harborside, where I had to build just one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can build, like you said,
across the country and the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got clients in Europe, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's no doubt a difficult
year for everybody, including consultants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is that, you know, it gives me an
opportunity to take everything I've done
[SPEAKER_03]: and just build the industry, you know,
throughout the country and throughout the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's enormously satisfying when you work
on something as a consultant and the
[SPEAKER_03]: clients not only are expectations met,
but expectations are exceeded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when it feels really good
because I go in and out of jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I get hired for three months,
six months, maybe a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the entrepreneurs run their own
businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they love to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm having a real good time with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, trying to build some things in
New York right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really difficult moment in New
York.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all kinds of litigation and
licensing problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole dispensary model that
they've set up, you know, and they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: all these black market shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hundreds and hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is much different than we
experienced in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you saw that in LA a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember dealing with Measure Z clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Measure Z is this thing in Oakland where
the police have to treat cannabis as the
[SPEAKER_03]: lowest priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Measure Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, it was almost 15 or 20
years ago that got passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all these Measure Z dispensaries
opened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was hard because they don't lab
test their medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do anything with the packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, and it was hard to compete
with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember struggling with that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not as dramatic here in California
outside of LA, really, as it has been in
[SPEAKER_03]: New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: But New York's just one of these places if
the city of New York does not like a
[SPEAKER_03]: vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what the product is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a vacuum and people can make
money in New York on it, they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: fill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the regulators just didn't even come
close to understanding that dynamic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they have to enforce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it'll be a little easier to
enforce against the storefront than a
[SPEAKER_03]: delivery service or something like that's
less centralized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still going to be hard,
man, because they go in, they red tag it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they have to come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you come back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's like several steps
before you can like shut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the owners of those shops
are suing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they're suing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You made it legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just such a mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought California was the poster child
for how not to legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But New York's definitely a run for the
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have a flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: New York and California right next to each
other on the flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's easy to joke about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are human beings that are
suffering at the end of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the tip of the spear is somebody whose
ass is getting cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just I work on public policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something I like to do because
I'm frustrated because nobody listens to
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The elected officials, the boards,
they don't listen to us at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was in the who is now the
director of cannabis control in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in her office, I don't know,
10 years ago, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe maybe it was a little more than
that, like 2018, right when we are about
[SPEAKER_03]: to flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I whiteboarded her and I was like,
I put a big line in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_03]: whiteboard and I wrote lab test on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, and then I put an arrow
pointing below that line and arrow
[SPEAKER_03]: pointing up below that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need any regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you need regulation for?
[SPEAKER_03]: The lab's going to catch any nasties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulate the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, regulate the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a big problem with that because
now, you know, the labs have been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: some, you know, shady things with pumping
up potency results and shopping their
[SPEAKER_03]: results around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no consistency at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no protocols.
[SPEAKER_03]: The labs don't have a specific SOP that
they all have to follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if there's an outbreak of
bad beef, bad beef, if you tried to lab
[SPEAKER_03]: test every pound of ground beef that
Americans consume, you go broke and you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: starve and you'd starve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too much beef going through the
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot spend a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or two or three lab testing all that beef.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, unless they don't do anything,
unless there's an outbreak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, once there's an outbreak,
then they, then they do the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: the recall and they, they have all the,
they know where the beef came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that in the regs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they can trace it all the way back
to the producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they lock down that producer and
try to figure out the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: E.
[SPEAKER_03]: coli or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they recall all the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody gets sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you could do that with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could totally do that with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, I think maybe it takes a little
while to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's still, it's still such a
money grab right now that people will be
[SPEAKER_03]: not as honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, but, but if, if, if, if she would
have listened to me more, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The framework would be much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and we would be able to
compete and create one market instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: dual markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost have three markets now with the
hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and it's like, how many markets can we
have before our knees give up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and it just falls, it just
collapses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so my vision is to get all this
into one market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to do that is with good
public policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very hard to do after you've
screwed it up, like New York and
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If California would have just licensed
people that were already in the supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain and made it pretty easy for them and
made the lab test more intent,
[SPEAKER_03]: made the lab test the thing, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you had to work towards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we would have a lot closer to one
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean you wouldn't have quote
unquote bad criminal elements growing up
[SPEAKER_03]: in the forest and selling it back East or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably would have that, but law
enforcement would be able to be focused on
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't be worried about Swami.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't be worried about,
and the same thing with the regulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have been focused on the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're working backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have to fix it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to do because you can't get
consensus even from our own industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very fragmented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so what I hope for California is,
and I, I haven't been able to make this
[SPEAKER_03]: happen, but I've been talking about it
since 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to, I want a new ballot initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a new ballot initiative,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because if we would have had a new
ballot initiative in 2020, when turnout
[SPEAKER_03]: was so high in that election, we would
have won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we may want to wait till Gavin
Newsom's out of office after this last
[SPEAKER_00]: debacle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're mentioning his veto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the psychedelic pill and the cannabis
cafe bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, especially the, the cannabis
cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's psychedelics too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, you know, I, I like
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they should be legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they do more good than they do
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the cafes are going to support
small business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can you go against something that
would support small business?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, he was being a politician,
man, you know, he's probably running for
[SPEAKER_03]: higher office.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we wait till he's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always have to worry about someone
worse than him, but you know, I'm with
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very betrayed by Gavin Newsom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the cannabis cafe bill, the reason he
set cited for vetoing it didn't make any
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I'm worried about smoke in the
workplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding me, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, everything's vaporized, you know,
pretty much even dad bars are vapor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way any local person is going
to let you do combustion is if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: courtyard, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a courtyard and people are
doing combustion, there's no threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know from science that secondhand
cannabis smoke doesn't hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a lame excuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it was a terrible decision because
that will invigorate the entrepreneurial
[SPEAKER_03]: spirit here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have all these chefs doing
these infused dinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have these tour buses going
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have this hospitality thing is
emerging without any support from public
[SPEAKER_03]: policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You give us a cannabis cafe bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can sort of come out of the shadows
with that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, California is about food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about producing food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about gourmet food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about organic food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pairing food with cannabis is as
ancient as humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we ate cannabis as one of
the very early things we ate, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, it's super nutritious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a perfect protein to feed
a family for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and cannabis and food have a
great future in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy who ran that bill, Hanley is his
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a assembly person, I think from San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to take another run at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll probably put some stuff in there
to protect workers from smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you'll probably, what you always
worry about with these bills is they write
[SPEAKER_03]: it in such a way that no one can make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you write the cannabis cafe bill
in such a way that nobody can make money,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, no one's going to open a cafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, the people who don't
want to see this happen will be very happy
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, and you know, they're all up there
lobbying in Sacramento and who knows what
[SPEAKER_03]: the restaurant lobby did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows what the alcohol lobby did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much stuff goes, it happens behind
closed doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just how a lot of it works anywhere,
but particularly in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is anywhere and everywhere,
but yeah, particularly in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so corrupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, our political system is
pay to play, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, and I think a little of that is
probably inevitable in a democracy because
[SPEAKER_03]: money is speech to a certain degree,
but, but it's out of control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone out of control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone too far, you know, with,
with, with handcuffing everybody in the
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chain, all these entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's some brilliant,
wonderful entrepreneurs, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in California, um, that are still trying
to make all this work, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of us were looking at that
cannabis cafe bill and, and we're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, if this passes, I'm back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be a consultant helping
people outside of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Build their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to come home and build my thing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and isn't that what we want in
California is Californians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't we want right now, most of the
industries owned by people who don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: live in California or the United States in
some cases, in some cases, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I won't name names, but I know of
a big company in California, one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest, their CEO commutes from the East
coast to California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't even live here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's running, he's the CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we owned and operated a Harvard site,
I lived three blocks down the road from
[SPEAKER_01]: the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I had to be able to get there
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alarm goes off, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to be able to get there,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you know, my style of leading
people is to embed with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like an ivory tower, you know,
sending memos down, um, which
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately is what, what we've seen a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I want, I want the California
industry to benefit Californians.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's, it doesn't mean we're not
going to have people from outside of
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're here and they're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that we can get a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to his credit, Gavin Newsom did
veto that packaging labeling bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a big effort by the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he probably signed the petition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I signed the petition and you know,
that would have been a disaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause people like Swami would have had to
rebrand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, totally, you know, rebrand his faces
on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not allowed to have a face,
um, um, in that bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got that done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, like with all these things
in California public policy, you get like
[SPEAKER_03]: one quarter of a victory and two defeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, okay, next year, maybe we'll get
another quarter and, and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you do the math after 10 years,
you get a little farther ahead,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it takes 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're five years into the program now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Gavin Newsom's big line when we
passed it was it's going to take five
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take five years to work all
this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, year five, year five, year five,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, what are you doing except
vetoing bills that'll help other than the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the labeling bill, which,
which, you know, again, give credit where
[SPEAKER_03]: credit is due, but, but it's, you know,
and here in California, you have a super
[SPEAKER_03]: majority, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The democratic party is the one to blame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm certainly not a Republican,
um, um, but I'm not a Democrat either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm registered as an independent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and what they've done, I'm really,
really angry with the democratic party
[SPEAKER_03]: here in California, um, cause they've
really, really messed this up and continue
[SPEAKER_03]: to, and then, you know, spike the ball in
the end zone publicly and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so well, I'm registered as a
Republican, but I'm very moderate in my
[SPEAKER_00]: views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I, my mother's the same way
parents are the same way they live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I feel like I'm more of an
independent, I would say I'm more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent than anything now with the
times, but it's really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in the world where we all
used to just get along and now it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I'm a Republican, you're a Democrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's such a weird thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like there's one party
doesn't have all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one person doesn't have all the
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got to pick and choose what
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these things are subjective to our
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole debate about, you know,
the biggest thing that drives me is
[SPEAKER_00]: abortions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was set.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we set this stuff up in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended it there and now we're bringing
it back up and it bothers me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that kind of stuff really
bothers me about the Republican party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, there's things that bother
me about all, both parties, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but one of the things I've,
I'm pretty good at is working with all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most of my clients are
conservative Republicans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most all of them are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we have a great time together and
we build things together because we keep
[SPEAKER_03]: our eye on the prize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the prize is we're building a business
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, and we're taking a lot
of risk and we're spending money and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, those things are far more important
than, you know, who I voted for,
[SPEAKER_03]: who they voted for, you know, or,
you know, what we might feel about some
[SPEAKER_03]: other issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the thing about cannabis that I love
is it brings all kinds of people together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can be pretty conservative,
um, and you can be pretty progressive and
[SPEAKER_03]: those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can share cannabis together and
share a mission and values with their
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses together and do very well
together, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it used to be like that, you know,
it used to be rude to talk about politics
[SPEAKER_03]: at the dinner table.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be rude to, uh, tell people who
you voted for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were things my parent, when I was
growing up, you weren't supposed to share
[SPEAKER_03]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never asked somebody who they voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was considered very rude to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nowadays you don't even have to ask
somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, and with social media and
everything, um, it's, it's been amplified,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All this division, um, and tribalism and
partisanship has really been amplified.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that weed and psychedelics will
get people off of that and sort of break
[SPEAKER_03]: that loop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, because that's, that's what did it
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what did it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I can get along with anybody is
because I learned how to do that from
[SPEAKER_03]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you came up with the concept that I
love, uh, Cali sober and that is just an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you want to share a little
bit about Cali sober with everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think it's such a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Cali sober is a term I did not coin,
but it is a lifestyle that I practice and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, we have an addiction crisis
happening in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have over a hundred thousand people
dying every year from opioids and other
[SPEAKER_03]: hard drugs and fentanyl and all the rest
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Cali sober is a version of sobriety
that includes cannabis and psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_03]: but does not generally does not include
alcohol and hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very broad statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people who will call
themselves Cali sober that like to drink
[SPEAKER_03]: half a glass of wine every night or once a
week or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not focused on alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's focused on cannabis and psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's how I've managed my
relationship with psychoactive substances.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're in the underground or in this
industry, or you're a high powered
[SPEAKER_03]: executive Silicon Valley, a lot of those
folks are addicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of our community has issues with
this because we self-medicate because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a hard life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stressful life and people
self-medicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I, I saw this all through my
career, you know, and generally when,
[SPEAKER_03]: when our community gets strung out,
people get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring down other people with them or
their businesses fail if they don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: busted because they, they spend all their
money on drugs or alcohol or, or,
[SPEAKER_03]: or they, they just can't maintain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, whereas Cali sober, is,
is a lot of folks, you go to AA,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The 12 step program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and if you say that you take we to
cope, they, they won't allow most AA
[SPEAKER_03]: groups will not allow you to continue in
the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of people feel alienated by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always coffee and you know,
these, these are also psychoactives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and there are circles of, of sobriety
support groups in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know of one in it's called the,
I think it's called the sober stoner,
[SPEAKER_03]: but she's out of Texas and she,
she gathers people that are in recovery
[SPEAKER_03]: and they smoke weed together and they talk
about how to stay sober, um, and not
[SPEAKER_03]: indulge in the things that cause them a
lot of problems in their, in their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so I think it's sort of a,
um, it's very controversial Cali sober
[SPEAKER_03]: because they, they, why why is the word
sober in there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because it, it, when I talked to David
Crosby right before he died, about six
[SPEAKER_03]: months before he died, he's Cali sober.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, um, said, I don't like Cali sober.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you just call it Cali stoner?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, um, he felt that people that are
really strung out there, there,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of them need to be sober sober for a
little while before they can reintroduce
[SPEAKER_03]: something like cannabis into their
routine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I respected that viewpoint,
you know, I, I respect that, that
[SPEAKER_03]: viewpoint, but I also know a lot of folks
who take cannabis and psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_03]: might be just microdosing psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it helps them stay sober.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so when I got turned onto this
idea, um, I started to write about it in
[SPEAKER_03]: Forbes and a few other places,
and I started to talk about it and get
[SPEAKER_03]: people sort of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conversing about this because AA and 12
step programs have a terrible,
[SPEAKER_03]: not a very good track record.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's something like 20 to 40%
success rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if we can increase the success
rate from 40 to 80%, because we create a
[SPEAKER_03]: methodology that includes cannabis and
psychedelics while also keeping an eye to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that those folks don't start
abusing cannabis and psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, people can have cannabis use
disorders.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can have ketamine use disorders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it all over the place,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ketamine use disorders kind of growing
right now, cause people have access to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so ketamine is an easier compound to
navigate, you know, than psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and, and it does, it's a pain reliever
and it also, you know, gets your mind out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the default mode network and into
something that could be a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but people get in trouble with
it, you know, people get in trouble with,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know quite a few folks that I've gotten
in trouble with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and so Cali sober is,
is not something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, and it works really great for a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother, me, this is how we,
we, we, we've made it work for our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my takeaway is that cannabis
and psychedelics, they tune you in,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas a lot of these other drugs tune
you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the beauty of it is you get
tuned into the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I think of sober, I think of
being tuned into the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, uh, you might have to face
some hard reality and some hard truths on
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics, you know, about yourself,
about other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll bring things to light that can
be scary and can be these other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they tune you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas alcohol definitely numbs you,
you know, and these other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: they numb you.
[SPEAKER_00]: From reality, whereas cannabis in my
experience brings you back into reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I couldn't agree with you more,
you know, and, um, and so, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for people that might want to try Cali
sober, check it out, read my articles and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, learn a little bit more about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had seen some stuff on social media and
I've read a bunch of stuff on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea you weren't the one,
but you've been a big advocate for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm an advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The term has been around for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, um, uh, and there's like all of these
terminologies that we have and share with
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more than one origin story who
coined the term, but, um, but you've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: like Demi Lovato and you've seen Willie
Nelson and Billy strings wrote a song
[SPEAKER_03]: called Cali sober recently.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's starting to sort of be talked
about in pop culture and various different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just getting the message.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy strings is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's played a lot this year,
20, 20, 22 has been a big year for
[SPEAKER_03]: talented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just been on the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, it's a talented young man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, how old is he?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 28 or 30 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's super young.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's super young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess he played guitar with his
father growing up and you can tell he's
[SPEAKER_03]: been with that instrument a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, no, it's great to see the young,
some of the people coming up these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: He reminds me of Jerry Garcia in a way,
cause Garcia was very into bluegrass and
[SPEAKER_03]: the banjo and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Billy's good at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it, it, it, it, you know,
it's wonderful how the music just keeps
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when, um, from generation to
generation, um, and there's so many
[SPEAKER_03]: talented people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our country right now, it's,
it's, it's really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my prediction for dead and company,
I hope Bobby never retires, but if he
[SPEAKER_00]: does, I would love Billy strings to jump
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Billy strings and John Mayer,
you know, John Mayer has grown on me quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was very anti, very anti John
Mayer in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you've got to be kidding
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is there are 2015, I guess
originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, he's grown on me quite a bit and
he, you know, I saw them in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were there at the show too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I gave Steve a joint at that
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I connected with Steve to
get him on the podcast.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Saturday I was a little rowdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was 20 feet from the stage and it was
a little bit rowdy and the band kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: got everyone calm, which is great,
but yeah, good experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these life experiences,
we're just so blessed to be alive right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, I smile every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting up, I get to smile every day and
I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but we just get to experience these
amazing things, you know, and there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different things that we all get to
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen the Wolf brothers yet,
but I think that's the next thing I want
[SPEAKER_03]: to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, I went all, uh, all the nights
when they played in San Francisco and took
[SPEAKER_00]: different friends every night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and Billy, I haven't seen Billy
and the kids yet either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Billy strings at Red Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to go see it, but I've seen
the videos and you know, they played so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many roads, which is one of my favorite
songs about Jerry and about addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I totally relate to that
song.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he's hearing Billy strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't perfect, but Jerry's playing
wasn't perfect either.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a beautiful thing,
but look, man, the mistakes are part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you are an improviser and
that's almost the best part where it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect and flawless where it almost falls
apart, but right before you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to fall apart, Jerry would pull it
back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody would pull it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody would pull it back together or it
would get, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Mayor do that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, I agree with you at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, with John Mayor, um, but he's really
vibing with the band though and him and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby back and forth and, you know,
and, and everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and well, and I think he approached
the community and the opportunity with a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of respect and reverence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was really smart of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew it was going to hit his
participation.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going to get hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was going to get hated on for sure,
but he just, he just, he just kept being
[SPEAKER_03]: respectful and reverent of, you know,
the Grateful Dead legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, I was, I was sad to
hear that they're going to stop touring,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm sure they'll play some special
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you heard about the, the Sphere in
Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be playing the Sphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm pretty sure that was an
announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they've sold tickets for
it yet, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, I just, I love everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love good music just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Residents at the Sphere would work pretty
darn good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 tickets, but you know, I don't
know, but I know, I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The U2 shows looks pretty spectacular
though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, so I, I, they spent like $2
billion on that venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks, it's so futuristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you'll get your money back
eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a lot of concerts, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get your money back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next 20 years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something, maybe, maybe sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, selling $5,000 tickets,
you'd probably get them back a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With your career and all the things that
you've done, if you were to look back and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to yourself, you know, the,
the younger version of yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that had just been in the industry for
two years, what is the one piece of advice
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would give yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep more of the money I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be reoccurring with,
with people that I asked, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we took pretty much all of our profits and
we put it back into legalization and
[SPEAKER_03]: activism.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we had an industrial hemp
company in the nine, I mean, all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different ventures, arc view, candlelight,
all came from basically our own
[SPEAKER_03]: pocketbooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so yes, I, I, I, I, not because
I'm greedy, but because money is a tool
[SPEAKER_03]: and when you don't have much of it,
it's hard to build a business.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to do amazing things,
hard to do epic things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, and you know, me and my brother
really loved doing epic things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's been quite a few times
where we had vision or we had idea,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly since the prop 64 happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't have the money, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and couldn't really go get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because there's just really very
little money in the ecosystem of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, unless you're a big MSO or RO,
it's really hard to get any kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: investors in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it's just a very constrained
environment to raise money in right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, you know, if we had kept more
of our own, um, uh, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peaks and valleys would be a little easier
to navigate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think we, we could, and would,
and will, uh, just keep building,
[SPEAKER_03]: just keep building the industry and
building, you know, Steve's pivoted to
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelics a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got RIV retreats in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's an amazing thing
that he built, you know, and we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: build more stuff like that, you know,
but we are resource constrained at the
[SPEAKER_03]: moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like most people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, that's that, that would be what I
would tell my younger self.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you've been on this journey,
year 40 for me, you've been on this
[SPEAKER_03]: journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of us been on this journey a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sacrifice a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot of sacrifices,
uh, that one has to do, um, either to stay
[SPEAKER_03]: safe or to stay free or to take care of
the people you love or take care of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and, or get people out of prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all things that are super risky
things to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and require the only way you make Epic
things happen really is with sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you built this facility here and
you woke up every day and came in here and
[SPEAKER_03]: did it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to pay off for you,
but it was a sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do, you string enough of those
projects together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you know, you realize you're
carrying a lot of, you've got this big
[SPEAKER_03]: backpack of, you know, sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sacrifices that you're carrying around
and the sacrifices, they don't cause me a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole lot of regret, James, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but when I look at the lives of people
like me and my brother have been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this so long, or, you know, any of the
pioneers, um, everybody is worthy of
[SPEAKER_03]: abundance and everybody is worthy of
respect and everybody is worthy of
[SPEAKER_03]: participating in building this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that I try to keep my eye on that as
much as I can continue to create abundant
[SPEAKER_03]: models so that just like you're going to
do here, um, so that we can take care of
[SPEAKER_03]: more people, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: More of our people, more, more,
more of our community and more of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're on a mission to bring this
plant medicine to the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the people need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The world needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's, I don't know, 15 wars
happening on the planet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the planet itself is sort of dying
under our feet, under our watch,
[SPEAKER_03]: under our watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a lot of healing needs to
occur and everybody on this planet is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have to make sacrifices like we
had to make for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may be in different spheres of
society or different areas of business or
[SPEAKER_03]: different areas of nonprofit work,
whatever it is, everybody's going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: to make some sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, my partner, Samantha,
she lived on Maui for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a bunch of people she knows and
loves their houses burned down during the
[SPEAKER_03]: fires on Maui.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, huge sacrifices,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and all those folks are having to
scatter and rebuild and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: These, these plants, these medicines can,
you know, greatly help us with all of that
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and, and help us deal with these
traumas that are probably somewhat
[SPEAKER_03]: inevitable given the eight ball we're
behind on the climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and not to mention, you know,
the political divisions in society.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, so the plants are on the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the good news, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been carrying the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been, you know, plants don't have
feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have mouths.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't talk about themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's our job, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Move it around and grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, package it, tell the story of it,
educate folks about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then eventually the plants do most of the
work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the work for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen, the plant will show you the
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not just true with plants,
but you know, we kind of have a listening
[SPEAKER_03]: is super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just being a good listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all you entrepreneurs out there,
you want to really be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, become a good listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's Richard Branson talks a lot about
that and other folks because it's how you
[SPEAKER_03]: get information and that's an information
is how you make good decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so being a good listener with
plants and with people and with your teams
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and with your investors and everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is, is a critical skill right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there's a saying that,
uh, money's value is in its use and not in
[SPEAKER_00]: its possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you have lived that
example extremely well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, that's a great saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's so many things
that are tied into that too, but
[SPEAKER_03]: everything's a tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, our bodies, our voices are,
are, are, you know, money, all these
[SPEAKER_03]: things are tools, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, money probably is the one we're
most familiar with because when you have
[SPEAKER_03]: some, it's easy to take it and,
you know, do something with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, um, but all these other things
are also tools, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, and what we're trying, you know,
peace and love, man comes down to peace
[SPEAKER_03]: and love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and those are the two things that the
world needs the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you know, well, they
transcend language, they transcend
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace and love at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the religions and all the
traditions, um, talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not just a hippie dippy thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is, you know, and peace
doesn't mean a comfortable life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people get that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace doesn't always mean a comfortable
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living in peace, but mental, you know,
there is mental peace and mental freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are yogis in India who possess
nothing and they have a very peaceful mind
[SPEAKER_03]: and a very peaceful life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to possess stuff to be
peaceful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all within us, you know, um,
not easy, but comfort and peace are two
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think struggle, the struggles that
we go through are what define us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And struggle is something that I think a
lot of people steer away from and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: scared of when actually struggle is
something you should learn to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do cold plunging too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like, I'm embracing the cold
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's really, the cold water has
taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I read about Wim Hof for
years and all these other things until you
[SPEAKER_00]: really do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't understand what the cold water
can actually teach you, but it teaches you
[SPEAKER_00]: to go head on into the water and not be
afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you stay in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the funny thing is I built up,
I'm doing some of these 15 minute plunges
[SPEAKER_00]: now, which is, you know, you read stuff
and it's like, well, you only need three
[SPEAKER_00]: to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was doing that for a long time and I
built it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't always feel good when I come
out 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do 10, but now that I do these
longer ones when I do seven, it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not enough, but I get the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink a lot of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes before I do a show, I'll drink
some coffee to get in the mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause with the cold plunge, I feel like I
get that same experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm awake and I'm really present in
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like my brain functions better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing, I don't have the tub with
the ice, but I've been doing different
[SPEAKER_03]: types of cold plunges, but I'm,
it's more like 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I'll have to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: My way up to I started out with a little
bit longer than that, but I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: started out with two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time I did it, it was about
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did three minutes the next
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you realize is like these
things that you think are going to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause right before you get in freezing
cold water, you think it's going to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your subconscious is like, you're not
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over time, and I, I do it daily
now, and there's some arguments for how
[SPEAKER_00]: often you should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you just need to listen to
your body and do what's right for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some days I feel like only going seven
minutes and someday I'm like, I want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 minutes and I do it on an empty
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I get out of bed and I go into
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be below 55 degrees is the
ideal for like the cold shock proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody should try it and
force themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go straight into the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And decision making.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you decide first thing to do something
that's naturally uncomfortable for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all the other uncomfortable things
that happen throughout the day become a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, cause our subconscious,
I'm dealing with this a lot right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: our subconscious wants us to stay the same
and be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't want us to really change a
whole lot, especially if, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you figured out how to be somewhat
comfortable, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your body and your subconscious like
you're good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, you're going to try a cold one.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come in your mind, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to, and your subconscious wants you to
not do the plunge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so you have to have a lot of conscious
effort, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To make that decision and do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that right before I do mine and I
usually do it after my morning workout.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, um, I, I stand on the edge of the
water for a good 60, 90 seconds before I
[SPEAKER_03]: can make the decision to go in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's like your body's just,
it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: What your subconscious mind does when
you're like right there on the edge of the
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, do you do it for pain relief or you
just do it for mental or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I have ulcerative colitis and
it's in remission right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I did put it in
remission, I believe is the cold plunges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was on biologics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on this drug called Remicade and I
got off completely off Remicade and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing cold plunges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my doctor's like, you should
think about going back on Remicade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, I'm not having any
problems right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to wait another month
and another month turned into another
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned into another month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm completely off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like, yeah,
I changed my diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drink beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I drink alcohol, it's going to be like
a gin and tonic, but I don't drink a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the big thing is like
noticeable changes in lifestyle with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold plunge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes you really aware of where
you are in that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I see a lot of Tony Robbins,
we've got David Goggins, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of their biggest things is they
talking about doing stuff you don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, those are, you know,
we want to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our subconscious, like you're saying,
really wants us to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people try to veer
away from anything that's outside their
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort zone when really we should be
going head on towards it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I found that getting help
works with that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, I hired a personal
trainer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause now I'm in my fifties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I'm going once a week to the
trainer and he's given me all these
[SPEAKER_03]: exercises to do on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm getting in pretty darn good
physical shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it feels really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I would not be as far along had I not
hired the trainer because I learned
[SPEAKER_03]: exercises I didn't know before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, before that I would like,
I'd lift a little weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go on a stationary bike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go on a long hike, but I wasn't pushing
myself to the edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which the trainer does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the trainer also gives you a homework.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't do the homework,
you're going to be in a world of hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to put you through the workout
and you're, you're going to barely be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to finish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're incentivized to keep going
because you have to answer to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found, and whether that's getting a
coach like Tony Robbins or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: other people really help us transcend
these plateaus that we may find ourselves
[SPEAKER_03]: in life, you know, and, and again,
you know, it's, it's, it's not to
[SPEAKER_03]: shamelessly plug my consulting business,
but that's what people like us do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is, is, is, is we're here to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to reach out for help.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ego and the subconscious lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need any help.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're talking about something as
complex as darning a cannabis dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: in New York, you know, I'm seeing a lot of
folks in New York, just making really page
[SPEAKER_03]: one mistakes, you know, whether it be what
they're calling themselves, whether it be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what kind of space they rent,
whether it be the deal they have with the
[SPEAKER_03]: landlord, whether it be, and all kinds of
things, you know, I'm seeing, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to save people money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the big, I think a lot of
people don't understand is with
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants, they save you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you can hire someone that
can navigate that knows where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to go all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on a straight line from where
you are now to where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the base and do it efficiently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fast.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to do it fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it fast these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because every day that you're not bringing
revenue in is a bad day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is because you have to spend money
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be a license holder in any framework,
you have to spend money every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's thousands of dollars going out
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day there's new competition coming
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that market share gets smaller and
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and, and yes, consultants,
especially some of us that have been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this for a long time, we're not cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good ones aren't cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good ones are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but they're, but I like, I'm not super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, I'm, I like to think of
myself as the best, but I generally fall
[SPEAKER_03]: in the middle of pricing in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not way out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the law firms and other
people are, but I'm not, I'm not way down,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, where someone who doesn't have
the track record I do might price
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, and that middle place,
where I'm at, it, it, it gives people
[SPEAKER_03]: excellence and expertise at, at,
at a rate that will save them money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an example in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a medical framework there,
and they just issued a bunch of new
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: My clients got three of them and the state
board of pharmacy runs the program in
[SPEAKER_03]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: They require, they only give you nine
months from the time you're awarded the
[SPEAKER_03]: license to opening your doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: For dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very hard to do, especially if the
buildings that are available to you in
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning are not very good buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to take two of our three
buildings down to the stud and then build
[SPEAKER_03]: it out from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we still, because those clients
hired me and my team, we, they opened on
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like 60 or 70%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the other license holders in Ohio did
not open on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good 20 or 30 of them are still not
open.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I feel bad because like,
if you hired me, I would have had you open
[SPEAKER_03]: by now, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you know, and a month goes
by that you're not open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, that's, that could be a million
dollars right there that you lost,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you didn't get in revenue or more
than paid for your consulting service many
[SPEAKER_03]: times over, many times over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, these are the kind of
things that happen, um, um, for folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and I want to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want, I want you to avoid being late.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to avoid having to change
something that's built with concrete
[SPEAKER_03]: because you didn't plan it on paper,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people do you know that had to
tear out stuff that they built because it
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't done right the first time?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where you start to get in a
world of pain, um, because I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: tearing something out and rebuilding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best case scenario a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so now you've got a domino effect
because that piece of the building or the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the, the, you know, isn't built and
it's late.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a domino effect on
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost is more than double because
you have to tear out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to tear out and, and you feel
really bad as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just feel bad, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we don't want to feel bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but there is kind of a race to the
bottom right now, not just with
[SPEAKER_03]: consultants, but with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: With seeds, with every genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this too shall pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of this, you know,
and you've been around long enough with
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this stuff, it's like, it goes in
waves and it's a struggle now and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's probably going to be a
struggle again, and it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up and down, up and down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's kind of like life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, but it's more extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream than life, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, with the ups and the downs and
yes, this moment too shall pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, will there be a race to the bottom,
you know, for the foreseeable future in
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, you know, um, because the
frameworks are so screwed up with
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation and taxes that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers are very price conscious,
you know, and, and, and all the heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers are underground because they
can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course people want to slash their
prices to try to bring people in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can end badly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even if your margins are the same
or get better, because your inputs are
[SPEAKER_03]: cheaper, your cash flow is really much
lower, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a lower cash flow than you did
before, because you're selling something
[SPEAKER_03]: for 20 and eighth instead of 14 or
whatever the number is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, but you have the same amount of
employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it becomes the race to the bottom
becomes a cash flow issue and you can run
[SPEAKER_03]: out of cash.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And running out of cash is the biggest
disaster for any entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause now you're in receivership or
bankruptcy or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and talk about painful, you know,
and if you did a personal guarantee,
[SPEAKER_03]: you might personally be bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, it's, it's, and you know,
these, these horror stories are all over,
[SPEAKER_03]: all over or just all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's thousands of these horror stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so get some good advice, you know,
even if it's not me, get, get,
[SPEAKER_03]: get really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
