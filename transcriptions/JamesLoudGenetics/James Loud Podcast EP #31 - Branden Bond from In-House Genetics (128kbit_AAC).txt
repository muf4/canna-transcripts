[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, my special guest is Brandon
from In-House Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today, Brandon?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fantastic, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for making the trip down to the
Bay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things, one reason why I came
down here so I could sit across from you,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we could have a conversation,
because the Zooms, you kind of lose a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these in-person conversations
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you get to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to look in their eyes and really
see who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wish we were talking about
longer style formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish we had some more longer style
formats, but these have been really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The studio, my transition from the Future
Cannabis Project, where it was all Zoom,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the in-person, I really like these
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it's impressive,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you put a lot of work into it,
taking it very serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got mad respect for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you actually doing it
because the space needs it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great way to get the content and
information out to people that actually
[SPEAKER_04]: really need it, that are also learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know, growing, you're always
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in this big transitional phase
in the industry where it's great to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to talk to some of the people that
have a lot of history with the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the black market transitioning into
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yourself, you've been around a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's actually dive into in-house
genetics and kind of let's take a step
[SPEAKER_00]: back from that and talk about where you
get started in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you talk black market,
I like to refer to it as the gray market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it never should have been illegal
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's like any other typical
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Initial introduction, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: High school, smoking, to then selling,
getting packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come from the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Beasters was a thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you had this local, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where you initially kind of get
a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what I noticed was you had
Canadian and then you had local.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the person at local was a super fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, man, I would love to start
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you start searching.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody really talked to each other back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of go search for a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is probably around this time,
about 2002, 2003.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like any typical situation,
you start off in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was way different back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you grow and you sort of start kind
of creating like a co-op, like meeting
[SPEAKER_04]: people, it's like kind of a secret club,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're coming up like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you started getting pretty good
at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, this is two people came across,
met my partner, and he was really into
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he started really diving deep into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that I had is I had these
grows around the city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just more on the production side
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started noticing when he first
started making seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he just started getting good at
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's when I started paying attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we were talking one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, let me build a room out in
one of your places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, what about the
pollen?
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens if you see it on the whole
place?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from there, we just started
building out 10 by 10 areas, 8 by 5 area
[SPEAKER_04]: rooms, digging them out and doing it
properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was about the time that really came
full on in the in-house genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he was about a couple of years
into it, getting pretty established.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was just like a match made in
heaven, because I had all these genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had access to the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, a combination between the two
of us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mirroring the libraries together and then
breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, because especially about the
time, because when you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_04]: it, this is we always base ourself off of
quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the highest quality flowers and also
going after.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start growing OG strains,
extremely hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And back in the day with the bubbas,
you're going to get big old huge buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody loves that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you got into the OGs,
they were small, hard, dense buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turkey bag didn't look that big,
didn't have the peeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you start breaking it up,
once you start tasting it and all that,
[SPEAKER_04]: it changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where you come is you pride
yourself on the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're trying to find what's the next
thing or what's going to be the next
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So either you're popping seeds and hunting
them or you're sourcing the cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at any given time, we've always had
anywhere from 30 to 100 different strains
[SPEAKER_04]: in some sort of rotation and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as this is all going on,
in-house is growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're hunting through a ton of the
beans at any given time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sourcing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts getting really super,
super busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're just ultimately having a good
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that was really cool about
it was we're putting in all this work,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this following is amassing,
this in-house army.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started seeing these tags, the posts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is about the transitional time of
social media coming on board, becoming a
[SPEAKER_04]: big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was cool because it was like a
natural flowing buildup relationship that
[SPEAKER_04]: we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it comes to the work ethic,
we work hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always working.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you think about it,
in-house in itself is kind of like an
[SPEAKER_04]: iceberg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody gets to see the tips of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get to see all the stuff that
goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether it's through text message,
email, whiteboard, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're constantly working on something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the communication is critical between
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we do is I'll be working on
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's working on something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any given time, we'll know if
something's coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing that's huge to us is we
listen to what people are saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is if you're
talking about something that you used to
[SPEAKER_04]: have or you didn't have anymore,
and candidates are going in cycles,
[SPEAKER_04]: so you're trying to figure out what's the
next thing and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why we've been so
successful in that is because we listen to
[SPEAKER_04]: what people are saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people weren't talking or being
active, we would be missing there'd be a
[SPEAKER_04]: big, huge component.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one thing that's really we
pride ourselves on is the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: support us and the people that we get to
interact with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're always watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as an example, when it comes to
testers and everything else, those are
[SPEAKER_04]: people that we watch for months,
some cases years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, hey, you want to work with
us?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cool part is if you go back in the
history of the testers, they're now high
[SPEAKER_04]: flying on their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're part of a lot of people's
stories, not just from the testers,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's this huge mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys were breeding terps in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys were breeding good terps into
your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like part of your breeding program
was always to offer good terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that goes back to the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have notebooks on notebooks on
notebooks.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to hunting and selections
and then plant health, you have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: the most optimum healthy plant if you're
going to do any sort of breeding,
[SPEAKER_04]: any sort of pollination, because it's
going to affect it as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you're taking all this information,
putting it together, and you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, this may be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, when you look at it,
the hits is one number.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the misses, quadruple that or way
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff that never even hit
the cutting room floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a statistical game to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But phenohunting and going through the
selection process is so challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so crucial that you're able to
grow really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where some companies
have hit it and some companies have
[SPEAKER_00]: missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing selections, you've got to
be able to grow good so you can tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between this, this,
and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's 100 times over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but let's go back to what I was
saying in cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on what's going on around the
country, what's going around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you have is you have California
that's basically Mecca in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have the sneaker,
which is out of Vancouver, which actually
[SPEAKER_04]: took a lot of Amsterdam cups over the
years, which gets glossed over a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have this prideful folks up in the
Northwest where we're from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you don't really want to do what
everybody else is doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're going after something,
you're looking for uniqueness and constant
[SPEAKER_04]: uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the terpenes profile
starts coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start learning and understanding what
a terpene is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just thought there was a handful of
them at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're coming to find out there's
three, 400 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thials and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's 40,000 different unique
terpenes, flavor molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start doing your stem revs,
when you're checking the bud structure,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is kind of pre before we could get
some testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also testing is a flawed in a bit
because everybody is so set on high THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which when you go through high THC,
you got to understand that there's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be some stuff that's missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be the CBD that's going
to be gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a toll that it takes for a high
THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back in the day when we were in the low
20s range, we still had a beef of a CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where when people get nostalgic,
that's the weed that they talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you're taking, like I said,
you're constantly taking this information
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you have this whole library of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also too, if you can't find something
or you don't have it, you have a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: world out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Home growers that you can hit up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, can you give me a profile on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would it take for me to get a cut of
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to grow that out because I'm
going to put it into rotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one thing that we do a lot is
we go back to the people that support us
[SPEAKER_04]: and we hit them up like, hey, can we get a
cut of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times people will be like,
I'll give it to you for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, we got to give you something in
exchange or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that just goes back to always
constantly hunting for the best and
[SPEAKER_04]: staying on top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've gotten really great hits by
taking two great strains and crossing them
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a juggernaut that's out there,
which is slur cane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slur cane always will be special to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an example, slur cane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're harvesting for the hunt,
trying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't really think anything too much
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my partner comes in the building and
he's like, you got to check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were trimming actually a local
strain Truro G.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had all the trimmers there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had about 15 trimmers there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was all this commotion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the slur cane, at that time,
you just didn't see that tricone build
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just all sat there in amazement and
was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my partner goes, may I try to post
this yesterday on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, first 30 seconds on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they said?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I go, what's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, look at all that PM.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he was like, man, I was up all
night taking pictures, different angles
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you see the slur cane initial old
photos, that was my partner staying up all
[SPEAKER_04]: night trying to get the best picture of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely frosted out, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of photos on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember when you guys first started
posting, or I saw that on social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: how frosted out it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the guy that kind of, because at
the time we had the trim team and there
[SPEAKER_04]: was a guy that was heading it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd come over and he took a double look.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looked fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: It truly did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like, you know how you see
people that will roll some key.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll do something in order to boost the
test.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was basically just the fresh
first cut of slur cane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's those moments that really define and
stick out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're like, this is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the next step is let's put this out
to the world and see if they think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's where a lot of the stuff
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially the genius of my partner
going, oh, let's not just give out any
[SPEAKER_04]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it's fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the stuff is just not the right
time for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put those out as freebies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put those out to the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they get a pet, because what
you'll see is some will release months or
[SPEAKER_04]: even a year or even two years down the
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they see it, they go, oh, I got that
in a freebie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the coolest things that stick
out to me on the freebie aspect is I
[SPEAKER_04]: stopped by a farm down in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've become great friends since then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes by Rogue Farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he bought probably 30 packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he also had 30 just in-house crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, I just popped everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm running everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, because everything that
we've gotten from in-house so far is
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it flies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's about the time when the
legalization was just coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was the first couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when we had to kind of look and see
what that looked like and how that was
[SPEAKER_04]: going to shape and how we were going to
fold into that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: But originally, with the slur cane,
though, there's the slur cane and the
[SPEAKER_04]: platinum kushbreath.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things where we just know
that it will always stick out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the people who came back loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you start hearing people's
feedback in a way where they go,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, I bought my in-house pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was doing good with these other
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once that in-house got in my garden,
people started calling me.
[SPEAKER_04]: One guy sat in line at a high times event,
which they were notorious for long lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just getting in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy sat in line for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, man, I just had to come
meet you guys and see what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, before, I was just average.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, now my whole garden is
in-house.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I got the dispensaries calling
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was, I think, up in Michigan or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, man, that's what it's
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, why don't you just call me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have just came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, standing in line in the heat for
the first five, six hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's really where everything comes
from is the people that you get to see
[SPEAKER_04]: have success from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, too, there's a great
relationship there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what they put out to the world,
we try to return to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes it gets kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the small world, we're a really
big, huge deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the normal world, nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to meet that person halfway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where I think it's a great
relationship between any breeder and the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that buy their packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a two-way street there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll meet you halfway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send us your photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Social media has made that a little bit
difficult the past couple of years because
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to take you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, social media has changed a lot in
the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think social media can fool people,
too, where you got some stuff that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in reality, they go to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could pop some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get some stuff that has cardboard
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a blessing and a curse
associated with social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the fact that we've been able
to get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's united a lot of people that we
wouldn't normally be united with from all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, social media is a double-edged
sword.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because without social media, we wouldn't
be sitting here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant brings everybody together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because without this plant, I wouldn't
know you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't know me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it wasn't for also, too,
one, for social media, if we could just
[SPEAKER_04]: stay doing our work and we would have
never came out publicly or been as vocal
[SPEAKER_04]: as we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, too, we started seeing rumblings
of the changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know how things go when money is
involved in this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start seeing, OK, the reason
why we're so vocal in support of home
[SPEAKER_04]: growers is because we feel at the end of
the day that that's who made us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the reason why I get to say sit
here and have this conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our loyalty will always ride with them
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are understanding that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that message is being conveyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been part of some action groups
and advocating and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But without social media, you wouldn't be
able to do that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting in how it's evolved in
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've started to catch our stride on
YouTube with the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started on the Future Cannabis
Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that kind of evolved into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're starting to catch our stride
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, yeah, it brings people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of YouTube, YouTube's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's an algorithm that brought
me across the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I knew of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a well-known person.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was like, I'm going to check this
podcast out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was episode number 10 or 12
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just let it keep playing autoplay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, oh, this is great content.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think a lot of stuff
needs to get shifted to is putting out
[SPEAKER_04]: those type of content, getting these
stories out, getting people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like I said, you can find tidbits
of information that might help somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you only help one person,
then the whole thing is worth it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, same thing with my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if I change one person's life
and make their life better or educate them
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that's positive, I think at the
end of the day, it's all about putting
[SPEAKER_00]: positive things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of stuff that's just
neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you're a positive influencer or
you're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, too, you have people that just
want to see the world burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's actual people that are out
there that want to truly learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the void that you're filling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of the podcasts that you cut,
I listen to damn near all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I spend, we're always working,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got headphones in and either it's
between music or podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some good stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there are people that want
to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell these stories of these
amazing people because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing people in the world that have
great stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for me to be able to capture
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel really great being part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going in the future, that's where that's
critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where you're going to
highly excel into that is bringing these
[SPEAKER_04]: stories out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we were joking before.
[SPEAKER_04]: The show was like, man, it'd be funny
because you could do a VH1 behind the
[SPEAKER_04]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, also bring these folks because
because there's a lot of cool stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of like like it wasn't too
long ago that I used to wake up anxiety
[SPEAKER_04]: just written because I was like,
is today the day I get cracked?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not you're scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're nervous.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because because at the time, if you got
cracked, I knew I was making the news.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like multiple places, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and and that's a lot of stress to be
to be having.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, then the medical starts coming
in and they get a little bit of relief of
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you don't really grow up or you
stop thinking that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like anybody that's ever
done the gray market, as you would say,
[SPEAKER_04]: black market has had those fears.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the thing is, is is we signed up
for it because we knew what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and also, too, if you got cracked,
you know, keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you knew the job was dangerous
when you signed up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that, you know, over the like the
same people that I worked with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, back in the early 2000s are
still in it in some sort of capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still good friends to this today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I got a good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going back and forth from Thailand,
doing some stuff and actually being
[SPEAKER_04]: getting a lot of in-house love over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes by his name's Tony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seattle's best on on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've been friends for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so these bonds and these
relationships and all this stuff that you
[SPEAKER_04]: build.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, too, we come from a time when 99
Plants was a federal case, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think where a lot of people that
came up in the medical side of stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, especially in California,
all that they don't they don't really
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily felt that fear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or or had that same sentiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really blase about a lot of
stuff, you know, especially important
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I say is as quick as this
started, it could end overnight off one
[SPEAKER_04]: ruling.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and and so when you when you
take that into account, where some people
[SPEAKER_04]: are like, no, that'll never happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but like I said, everything's
profit driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, you know, we're getting a you
know, we're getting all this information
[SPEAKER_04]: that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of the biggest lies that they
tell you is, oh, we can't research or
[SPEAKER_04]: we're not researching this or we need to
research this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you go to the NIH website,
you can see since 2015, they've spent
[SPEAKER_04]: almost two billion dollars researching
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than half of that money went to the
negative effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did they come out with?
[SPEAKER_04]: They came out with the inconclusive
evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just throw this random stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which which in many cases, you can make an
argument that other medications are the
[SPEAKER_04]: cause of of what they're claiming that can
contributing factors, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's really important people to
know what CB1 and CB2 receptors are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like slots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a medication going into it,
those slots fill up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you put cannabis on top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your body is going to try to expel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have these adverse
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have these issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like if you if you, you know,
you know, over over consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those receptors are full and
your body needs to expel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to have these crazy
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's a lot that goes into
I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stuff that I've learned over the
years from talking to doctors and talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to PhDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a you know, there's there's a lot
there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just simply scratching the
surface surface of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in an infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is I mean, I think a lot of
people think we've come a long ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we still have a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just starting to understand the
plant, you know, from a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a beautiful time to be in the
industry, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great time to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it was never even when it was
illegal and you were dodging cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still a great time to be in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you want to get nostalgic about
it, it was a stressful, terrible time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, if you were talking
to another grower, right, and you got past
[SPEAKER_04]: the the, you know, like, you know,
the the vague conversations you would
[SPEAKER_04]: have, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you start getting down and you start
sharing ideas, you start sharing tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's a lot that that comes with
that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to discount the people
that are struggling right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think there are a lot of people
in the industry that are struggling and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to figure out their next
move and how to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the price has gone down all
over for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very competitive market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing I can say is grow a
better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest thing is like to be
competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to create something that's better
than what else is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, before you people used to get by
growing middle grade product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole middle grade thing is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people that live in that one
percent, if you're talking about quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to survive and they'll be
able to pivot and and hopefully be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I would say that there's room for
all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is this is you
have a situation where you have you always
[SPEAKER_04]: have your top high quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always going to have your have your
folks for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go, hey, this is because
because cannabis is a social situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, too, it's a competitive
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found the better I found the better
flower, the better rosin, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always going to have that
demographic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have the people that just kind of
want to something to turn the world off
[SPEAKER_04]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which which mids will fill that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think the real problem is and a
lot of people, especially if you're in the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial world, go into any dispensary,
any retail, look on the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take note of every strand that's on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go back to your grow and don't grow
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're going to compete against in
some markets, 100 other people's version
[SPEAKER_00]: of filling the blank and people that can
produce it for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you grow better quality,
it's hard to compete with somebody who has
[SPEAKER_00]: a lower price point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So based off of the stuff that we've done
in the past and especially in the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen.
[SPEAKER_04]: A friend of mine comes or he's a friend of
mine now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the time, we just I think he just
hit me on a Facebook page or on Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, oh, I run this 502 in
Washington and I'm looking for a new
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, come on by your spot,
you know, and we'll see what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they get to talking to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Roy.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, he's like, I'm looking,
I'm growing this, growing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, so is everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think at the time we had the and the
way the black cherry punch was coming up,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a few there was a few that were
just just coming into stride on social
[SPEAKER_04]: media, like, you know, the tags and all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after he got off the initial little
sticker shock for the clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I said, man, this this might
change.
[SPEAKER_04]: This might change what you're you know,
might change your way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Went back room and you can go back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to track 502 data and you could
go back to that date that he would that he
[SPEAKER_04]: got those plants and you could see three
months later that his numbers went up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's a combination of two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics and his hard work.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, genetics is the foundational
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the hard work and his hard work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so same with I mentioned them earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rogue Farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Runs heavy in-house every year and does
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one of the he's probably one of
the hardest working farmers that I've met
[SPEAKER_04]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've met a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hands down, when it comes to outdoor
light depth, you know, which everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: throws shade on one of the best out there,
you know, people throw shade on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great if you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light depth is an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then the mix light with
supplemental lighting is you can create a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that, you know, people are going
to hate that I say superior to indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the natural sun with
light, you know, and now they have these
[SPEAKER_00]: inner canopy lighting that you can use to
tighten up those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the future in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a it's a more
environmentally friendly product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also is a different product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's it's also to like when you the
mad dash, when everybody got into the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, one thing that stood out to me
was like, why are we building indoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Only reason why we grew indoors is because
we needed to keep it away from the people
[SPEAKER_04]: that have alphabets on their chest.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: The alphabet letters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we needed to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you look at the Dutch and all
this other agricultural folks that just
[SPEAKER_04]: kill it and every other crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis isn't much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can create pristine environment in
a in a glass, you know, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These Venlo's, these Dutch Venlo's are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in some greenhouses where they
got the flood and drain right there in the
[SPEAKER_04]: right there on the right there on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this big old huge orb comes out
every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like clockwork, literally, you know,
utilize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's a learning curve like
anything, but also to I think when we talk
[SPEAKER_04]: in recreational, I think a lot of people
had the learning curve from going from,
[SPEAKER_04]: say, like a thousand feet to 30,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of these factors that go in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of all, and I can't stress this
enough, your biggest enemy isn't the guy
[SPEAKER_04]: growing down the street from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your biggest enemy is the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The politicians that are making these
crazy bogus rules off of a whim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Aspergillus in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that got my opinion on that was I
don't think they wanted to open that
[SPEAKER_04]: Pandora's box because you start opening
that Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it into law.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can push that over to food right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is safer than our food supply.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to what you can put on food
compared to what you can put on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also, too, as a as a group pushed
back on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also to the, you know, the powers that
be were like, actually, we can't really
[SPEAKER_04]: open this Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to start digging around,
kicking the box around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next thing you know, we're going to get
we're going to get some results that we
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and a lot of people don't recognize
and rightfully so.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got their whole, you know,
they got their regular life, all that
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but if you really took a second and
realized how we're, you know, these rules
[SPEAKER_04]: and everything is maining, it's not for
the greater good of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's where I was saying before is,
is going off of Washington standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're a tier one, that means you're
two thousand square foot grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you're a tier two,
that's a ten thousand square foot cap
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a one or two, I would say take a
minute and find out your other tier ones
[SPEAKER_04]: and your other tier twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go meet them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go talk to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to work with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just know of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But support each other on social media
with, you know, however works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you have the much larger guys that
can help reduce you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a better terminology, but it can
flood the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a group, you got to get in that
information into people's hands and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're seeing it on their screens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go check this this this label
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we don't have that distinction
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside of a couple of situations where
where you have a branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the the larger brands are no
longer normally already a small operator,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, fulfilling those much larger
brands that you see across the country.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These MSOs and Washington's beautiful,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with House of Cultivar up in
Washington and also Kano Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with them on the you know,
we've done projects together and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's smaller and I feel like it has
an educated market up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think the the customers are a
little more educated than in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They trust their brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: West is always found and carved out their
own lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make no mistake about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like like we are literally in the rain
shadow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but but what that said is, is that just
that just goes to show the tenacity of
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are from the Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to find a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll we'll bump the car.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll crash the car along the way,
but we're going to find a way and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be the best at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have, you know, other places that
are that are going to catch up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you look at the model that's up
there, I don't necessarily agree with how
[SPEAKER_04]: they set up the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you create the retail as the
gatekeeper.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back to the same all your tier one and
all your tier twos, you guys come together
[SPEAKER_04]: and you start creating a ruckus and you
stop asking, start demanding co-op,
[SPEAKER_04]: start demanding, you know, farmer market
style situations, start demanding where
[SPEAKER_04]: you can actually bring in the customer or
bring in the person and educate them on
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way that that works is you guys
all coming together because, you know,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they think they're all competition
with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's like, no, no,
your ship has some holes in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to plug them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way you're going to do that is
teamwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, whether they do that or not,
but like, as an example, you've got ghost
[SPEAKER_04]: out there, which is from Cush family
originals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy is a beast when it comes to the
502 market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost OG classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way he operates and where he runs
out there, he's a beast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he's, he's like quality in quality
out, but it pulls no stops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, will you want to come at him with
something?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's coming right back at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, as an example, one of the funniest
things he had, one of the largest,
[SPEAKER_04]: larger companies, uh, fat Panda put up a
post one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's better fat Panda or Cush family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on, it was on there on their posts,
but they just got ratioed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so what does ghost do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dresses somebody up in a Panda outfit
comes out of his house on a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, he's buying on me Panda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the Panda kind of,
kind of peeking his head around the
[SPEAKER_04]: corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that kind of stuff and comedy is
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think the camaraderie between the
two companies was awesome because it made
[SPEAKER_04]: people laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody had a great time, you know,
and they all got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all got exposure of it, of it,
you know, but that's where, but also too,
[SPEAKER_04]: he backs it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like one of the rods in that he's
putting out on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's very critical about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so now there's a bunch of other,
other people that have that exact same
[SPEAKER_04]: story that are putting out a great,
you know, great product, but they're
[SPEAKER_04]: getting overshadowed because they don't
have the reach or, or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and so, but yeah, with,
with Washington in particular is you have
[SPEAKER_04]: these groups that say they're fighting for
you, but I call them like they're the
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled opposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, um, it's very telling,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're always asking you for money,
but they're not doing anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're telling you, oh, we're doing
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we're doing that in, you know,
speaking about on that is like with those,
[SPEAKER_04]: with those groups, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to really look into them and see
what they are doing for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way you're not wasting your time
or wasting your money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also too, I, I always tell people it
costs 25 bucks, 50 bucks run for city
[SPEAKER_04]: council.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Run for something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you don't think you're going to
win, you might surprise yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what it does is if you take votes from
somebody, they got to come and they got to
[SPEAKER_04]: give you concessions.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got to, you know, that way you can
say, Hey, if you're like, I would love to
[SPEAKER_04]: see one point in this country,
because we come in numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we all stood together, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like, you know what,
we're going to stop this shit right now
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're going to make them come give us
concessions because we have this people
[SPEAKER_04]: that don't identify.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might be a Republican, might be a
Democrat, whatever the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got this background, but we're going
to protect this plant and make sure you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't steal it from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and then that, that translates and
starts flowing down to, to the local
[SPEAKER_04]: levels, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That gives people the inspiration to also
stand up and be like, well, if they're
[SPEAKER_04]: saying something, I'm going to say
something.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how this country works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You push, push, push, push.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden we push back and
then the government be like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_04]: slow down, slow down, you know,
right on a local level and even on a
[SPEAKER_04]: national level.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's where it comes to is,
is I always urge people work together,
[SPEAKER_04]: gets outside of your comfort zone,
get outside of your box and stop,
[SPEAKER_04]: stop recognizing people that aren't your
competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually, you know,
your ally in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that way, the people that are those
groups that I just talked about have to do
[SPEAKER_04]: the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all of a sudden the money will dry
up or that group will form another group
[SPEAKER_04]: that will actually go fight for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so let's talk about something that's
been a regular conversation with the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of episodes, which is a
descheduling or reschedule more so
[SPEAKER_00]: reschedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion on the reschedule and
deschedule?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the, so the dropping into schedule
three, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is a clear evidence that they are going to
try to control this plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is a schedule one,
they get all this cover, they get to hide,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's, it's, it's schedule one,
it's still illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the schedule three is balances
and keeps the ball in pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: court.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pharmaceutical industry and, and,
and tobacco and alcohol are the three
[SPEAKER_04]: largest lobbies and everywhere things are
gonna go legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the three largest lobbies that are
on the no vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should tell you, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it, that means that this is going to
hurt them in the pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know cannabis helps a lot of people
in a lot of ways, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That information has been suppressed,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to push and try.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Biden came out, Biden and Democrats,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where they really screwed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They campaign on decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we get this bogus pardon,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, but the real reason why
that pardon came about wasn't to do the
[SPEAKER_04]: greater good for the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it didn't got nobody out of jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it was is they were getting ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even posted about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The day that that pardon drop,
they're getting ready to do a deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: Russia to release a WNBA player in
exchange for the most notorious arms
[SPEAKER_04]: dealer in human history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really good trade.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask me, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, but aside from that,
they can say now, because the grinder was,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was in jail for possession,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was a, is, was bogus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it was like nine years or
something like that, but you can't have
[SPEAKER_04]: the same chart, same rules on your,
in your country, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you're advocating to get,
you know, the, the too harsh of a penalty,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so that comes out and they,
they, he could have stroke of a pen
[SPEAKER_04]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but the, but the, but that would
mess up the total plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the, that's the total control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of this plant, because if they true every,
there's a few people that are in the know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if the true properties and importance
of this plant information actually came
[SPEAKER_04]: out, it'd be a game changer.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, there was a tiny little snippet
back in 2014, a Medicare or Medicaid,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of those two, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Washington alone saved $33 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was because people foregoed
they're going to get their prescription
[SPEAKER_04]: and was hitting the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that rung a bell.
[SPEAKER_04]: To a lot of, a lot of these special
interests, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Oh, people are getting out of taking
our pills.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right around that time you had,
you know, you had the CBD patent,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was issued by the patent office for
the human and health services.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a long way about going about
schedule three, but the way I see schedule
[SPEAKER_04]: three and the reason why it's going to
schedule three is to give the,
[SPEAKER_04]: what they consider the peasants,
the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they locked down the extraction
because that's where the real medicinal
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, is in the extractions,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a, but then they can't come out
and decriminalize because we live in a
[SPEAKER_04]: country that, you know, incarceration is a
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got a bunch of people out
of, out of jail, you know, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of people in jail that shouldn't be in
jail, but also too, as a country,
[SPEAKER_04]: we, we have to take accountability on
ourselves for not standing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why the politicians don't do
half the stuff we don't want them to do is
[SPEAKER_04]: because we don't push back on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't push back and they don't,
not forced to do it, they're just not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then what they'll do, but one thing
that I saw when, when the news came out
[SPEAKER_04]: that they were going to move it to
schedule three is I saw people go,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, it's better than schedule one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, it's not right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, and they're like, it's virtually
not going to change anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, it's pretty much legal now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you got to look at the fine
print.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I just saw is, is like,
I come from a time where it's fight or
[SPEAKER_04]: flight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I got the scars on my face
because I always chose to fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where we're losing in
this country is we're losing the desire to
[SPEAKER_04]: fight, but, or we just haven't clicked on
what to fight for yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think a lot of this is,
is boiling out to is, is I think people
[SPEAKER_04]: want to fight, but they're been so
suppressed and beat down that the
[SPEAKER_04]: incremental stuff like a Biden pardon or,
you know, the, the moving to schedule
[SPEAKER_04]: three is, Oh, that's progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in reality, it's virtually nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we, as a society, especially in the
United States have become so fragile and
[SPEAKER_00]: soft over the last 50 years, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is, is like,
we're looking at symptoms rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people see this and that's a
symptom of a much bigger problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really need to start recognizing
the problems rather than the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so you're going to, you're going to
go, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to concentrate on this,
but I'm going to completely ignore the
[SPEAKER_04]: cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like, it's just like, you learn
this in growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd be like, Oh, I got an issue with
my plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I got some bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to spray it, come back in the
next day or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you go, Oh man, it got worse,
but it's just, it's just what you sprayed
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to recover from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next thing you know, you're going down
this rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're digging in the soil,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when the reality, if you would have
just comprehensively taken a second and
[SPEAKER_04]: looked at it and go there, here's my plan
is what I'm going to do to fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't go down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where I think a lot of people
running into this is, is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: like they, they, they're so focused on the
effect that they forget about the root
[SPEAKER_04]: cause.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this comes back to a lot of
situations, like even with, with hemp,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, hemp hands down could almost
create, in my opinion, world peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way, the reason why I say that is
because it would literally get us off the
[SPEAKER_04]: dependence of foreign oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would, we would almost virtually
replace plastic in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in just a number of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't have this big old huge patch
in the middle of the Pacific ocean that's
[SPEAKER_04]: choking out all our stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microplastics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the ground cover of a cover crop of
hemp and the amount of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the oxygen that would, it would give then,
then the impurities that would suck out,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also to the bioremediation of where
that plant is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got to look on the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the flip side, there goes petroleum
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to take a hit plastic,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that they want to produce
three or four more times the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic than we already produced today.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're projecting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're like, where in the hell are you
going to put all this plastic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, oh yeah, it's going to go in
that big old ocean there in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_04]: ocean and swirl in a circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also too, when you start digging into
it, right, we had this back in 2018,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2017, 2018, we had this big old huge hemp
that was coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And FDA came in and squashed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did the FDA come in and squash it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people are now recognizing CBD
really helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a quick, efficient way to get
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are beginning to put in water that
we're going to put in foods or we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to put in edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the FDA is there to protect the
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be the other way around.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to protect us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you really break it down and
anybody can fact check this.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70% of FDA funding comes from the very
people they're supposed to regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to go kick their gift
horse in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that, if those industries say,
Hey, go curb this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go, we can curb this and we'll hide
behind the DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause DEA is anti everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just the way that they're set
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No fault of their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're, they're there for the
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so you have the FDA that is a captured
agency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have all the, a lot of these agencies
are captured agencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you start seeing the progress of the
studies, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The NIH, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say you're a scientist at NIH and you're,
you develop something, you actually put,
[SPEAKER_04]: you actually get part of the patent,
you know, so if you develop something and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and when the NIH develops a patent,
it goes from there straight to a
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even though it's all taxpayer studied,
funded the whole nine, then the farmer
[SPEAKER_04]: takes it and they go, well, we're going to
try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to charge you 10 times,
30 times, 40 times, 50 times the amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when they do that, that's why we
have a seizure medication that costs
[SPEAKER_04]: $34,500 a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is just pure CBD oil in a country
where your median income is $55,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just taxed a bunch of people that
feel more comfortable in the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can really, you can virtually make
this for pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if somebody puts that information out
there, immediately discounted,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera, all that, you know,
but, but what you see is, is that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: small little glimpse of what this,
what this future looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have Pfizer that bought arena
pharmaceuticals, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the main reasons why they bought
arena pharmaceuticals because they,
[SPEAKER_04]: their heart medication, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but they were building a,
they were, they created a medication.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's called Olin lab or something
similar to that, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a CBG derived medication and it
treats Crohn's disease.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now people that suffer from Crohn's
disease, or suffer from seizures,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any little bit of relief goes a long way
with those folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that medication, when it hits the
market, it's going to be $100,000 a year
[SPEAKER_04]: market, even though you could take some
plants, grow them in your yard and
[SPEAKER_04]: virtually make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the information they want to
suppress.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they want to, that's why they
want to knock the home grower out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they want to, they want to knee
cap a lot of this, this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think hemp and cannabis
relationship, it has the ability to really
[SPEAKER_04]: change how we do stuff because cannabis
and hemp will bring our jobs back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll bring manufacturing back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll make us a back again, true power,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've lost a lot of power around the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: This country, they came over and the ropes
on the boat were made of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was even a law where you had
to grow hemp, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so, so it's not like we're
reinventing the wheel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to take control of the wheel
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way I see that happening is,
is the people coming together,
[SPEAKER_04]: the people talking, people having these
conversations, getting this information
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not mad, you're not paying
attention.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I, I go heavy in this because
I'm passionate about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a love for this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a love for the people that support
in-house, support me, support the people
[SPEAKER_04]: that are doing the good work out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like there's a guy out in Maine,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Shirley and he went from just
going and attending these committee
[SPEAKER_04]: meetings, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then being vocal, then he really
started gaining traction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he goes and starts his own
lobbying firm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now those same politicians have a fear of
this man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've watched this just happen in just
in the past two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and he's, he's, I wouldn't say he's
crazy, but he's very passionate about what
[SPEAKER_04]: he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I, when I see it,
I'm a big fan of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm like, that's what you're
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're supposed to speak truth to power,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're ignoring you, you yell
louder, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and if you got, you know,
if you got to push it from there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until they, until they listen to you,
until they hear you, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and I think we're getting to that
point, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in my opinion though, I think cannabis
and hemp in itself could really have such
[SPEAKER_04]: an impact on this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be the newest industrial
revolution that would make it far better,
[SPEAKER_04]: far better world, you know, you know,
that's, and that's just the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: speaking honest, it's like you and I
sitting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your opinion on the direction
the cannabis industry has kind of gone
[SPEAKER_00]: with everything being July?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see it going in the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: This comes back to, it comes back to home
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a commercial farm, you have a
license, I would go back and support the
[SPEAKER_04]: home growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Home growers are going to protect and keep
the genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be the key to the
continued success of having the diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause what you're going to have is you're
going to have a lot of bigger companies
[SPEAKER_04]: and MSOs that are going to give you
equivalent to what would be a Budweiser,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that really want to,
that are interested in or what do you call
[SPEAKER_04]: legacy or people that really love the plan
and want to be in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be the micro brewers of
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already have this model where we could
base it off of, and that's the craft brew
[SPEAKER_04]: model.
[SPEAKER_04]: People working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: During the 90s, you had these shops that
would pop up and you'd have five,
[SPEAKER_04]: six, seven, eight brewers in there brewing
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an example, the reason why we have IPA
right now is because it came from that
[SPEAKER_04]: movement, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my lawyer, right, he owns a couple of
stores there in Washington.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he used to think the home grower was
competition to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did a live one time and he comes
from part of the hops industry and the
[SPEAKER_04]: beer industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I explained that to people in a live
one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he called me up after he goes,
man, you know, he totally changed my mind
[SPEAKER_04]: on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what I'm saying is the
roadmaps, all the information is there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I, when I look at it as I go
protect the home grower, because that is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be your line, last line of
defense when they come for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that really famous poem,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They came for me or they came for such and
such.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came for such and such.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they came for me, there was nobody to
speak for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's more to it, but it,
but it's the same way.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Money will money corrupts everything in
this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in the way, they're going to
push you out the way unless they have some
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you, when you get it,
you know, back to what we were saying
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier is go see what everybody else is
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And start phasing in other stuff and find
your lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you find your lane, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're, you're on your cruise control
and nothing against, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people, if they feel that's what they want
to do or anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, a lot of this cookie that or
whatever, then that then carve out your
[SPEAKER_04]: own lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be the best at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, and present it and give it
to the world, but also to the world is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to tell you whether you're any good
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get real feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as an example, the, we're like,
I think a lot of people miss is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: we mentioned earlier, social media is such
an important part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see these companies where they're
like, Oh yeah, I have a Facebook page or I
[SPEAKER_04]: got a, I got an Instagram, but I don't
really, I don't really do much with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, you can't go and have a
billboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't advertise anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't advertise there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't interact with people,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can, you know, it goes a
long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as an example, we get a lot of
messages, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to get through as many as possible.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of the cool things is once you hit
up and be like, Oh damn, I didn't think I
[SPEAKER_04]: was going to get a response.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and you're just passing
information or, or whatever the hell it
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: These companies need to more focus on the
social media aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also to my, my advice is you have a
live button.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a video button.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really easy to now do, you know,
somewhat of a production, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you have to have a computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to have all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take people on tours of your grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or explain a situation or explain what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that way, when they see your brand
on the shelf, they go, Oh man,
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I saw those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's, there's, there's all of
a sudden a connection there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they, you know, people are going
to grow what they're going to grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever you grow, just be the best at it
and put it out to the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it comes back negative,
you're going to have to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give feedback, switch it up, figure out
what, what works for you, what you like
[SPEAKER_00]: and what other people like as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, feedback is scary to get because
you're so such a prideful person,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I would say be open and receptive to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Filter out the trolls, filter out the BS,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And find the people that are really
critiquing you in a way that are going to,
[SPEAKER_04]: that are going to make you a better
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's what you want to focus on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if somebody says, Oh, your shit's mids
or your trash or whatever, forget about
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to ignore those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's always going to be the
naysayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be the people that are
saying you can't be successful and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just got to push through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, uh, I can't wait for people to
get some of these land race varieties back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the mix and some of these unique
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think diversity is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love working with diverse stuff,
you know, and I also, but I also recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: what the market demands right now and what
the market likes, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even some of these old flavors that I grew
up with that we haven't had for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time, I can't wait to see some of those
hit the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Romulan is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: My story with Romulan was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was this one guy, I mean,
my roommate would meet and, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he, and he had the, he had the Romulan
that ounce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would leave a room and we're talking 30
minutes, 45 minutes later, you would think
[SPEAKER_04]: it was still in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't have that really anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think it's just, um, we've been in
this mad dash to get, uh, the highest THC
[SPEAKER_04]: content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's a major factor,
which is obviously going to take away from
[SPEAKER_04]: the other cannabinoids are going to take
away from terpene profiles.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but when you mentioned land raise,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited that once the science starts
coming out, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these old people, some of these,
you know, people that have been in it for
[SPEAKER_04]: a long time, they still have these old
seeds are sitting on the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think everything goes in cycles,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll start bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, that's one thing where I
think hemp, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp is going to be pretty critical
because you, if you have a high CBG plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, which is a mother of THC and,
and CBD, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you start, uh, start crossing into
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and back crossing to that,
it may change and you'll start getting
[SPEAKER_04]: more of a, more of a cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mojave Richmond told me something
the other day, a good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing guy that the race is over when the
seed leaves the land, but the diversity is
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I love is all this
diversity that we can throw in and finding
[SPEAKER_00]: new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's part of the reason I love
breeding and I love the selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love finding new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always about discovering new things
and new possibilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's back, you know, and one of the
things is, is why I think the home growers
[SPEAKER_04]: are extremely important because a
commercial farm isn't going to grow a low
[SPEAKER_04]: yielding plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of, a lot of magic and a lot of
great things are found in the low
[SPEAKER_04]: yielding, ugly looking plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, uh, like what I'm starting to see,
and we'll see if it, how, uh, if it
[SPEAKER_04]: becomes something, but, uh, but plants
that are really extremely, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: have the Fox tailing trait, you know,
not even stress induced trade,
[SPEAKER_04]: but just there's Fox tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, now these, now these washers are like,
that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's more surface, you know,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you go back a couple of years,
everybody was like, Oh, look at that
[SPEAKER_04]: trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Fox tailing, you know, keep it away.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, it, but it's like ever changing,
ever, ever evolving, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like, there's some people right now
that have strains that we thought we've
[SPEAKER_04]: lost forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just sitting on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one, there's a few strains to me
that always hold dear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I have the one of the original or the
award winning true OG, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant will never, never leave us,
you know, and what I mean by that is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is it'll go out and out, but I'll never
lose that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's just because, uh, Derek from
elemental seeds, you know, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's a lot of history there
and, you know, uh, from the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got this, there's this other
gorilla glue, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I, that I pulled from, uh,
another friend of ours that had passed
[SPEAKER_04]: away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a phenomenal, but so as much
heat as a lot of some of these strains
[SPEAKER_04]: get, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll never go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're always staying, they'll always
stay in, in, in rotation or staying,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in our house.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, but there's other people that
have strains that are, that are way older
[SPEAKER_04]: than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still keeping around and just
remothering and, and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you will see, you know, we'll see if we
can keep up on the diversity, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to, I think you're going to
see people, uh, once there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: information come back, they're going to
start circling back around and being like,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's get this THC back to back into the,
low twenties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's bring the CBD back up, you know,
get the flavor back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, there's going to be flavors that we'll
probably come across that we didn't even
[SPEAKER_04]: think was, was possible, especially with
that, with that many, uh, terpenes and
[SPEAKER_04]: that information coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is, is information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing about that plan is it's
resilient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just when you think you have it dialed in,
it's like, nah, no, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm throwing you a curve ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think some of the problems we're
having with like Hoplate and V-Ride could
[SPEAKER_00]: be due to, you know, breeding depression
from all the gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to get stuff back in there
that's diverse to get some more vigor into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, to get them healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't even talking about viruses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you talk a lot about that on your,
and I would, I'd love to get your opinion
[SPEAKER_04]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole industry hop industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Done ton of research on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we not know this inside and out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the hop can live with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cannabis plant is a cousin of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's the, what's the genetic
marker that's allowing that to happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the, what's the process of this?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, there's so many of these
variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one thing that I see is, is like,
it's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not the end all end all,
because we've, if you've grown for any
[SPEAKER_04]: certain amount of time, I remember when
basically aphids was like, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spiders killing that with Dawn's soul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever dealt like, I'll tell you
these, these, the broad might and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Russet might, those are spawns of the
devil from hell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember it used to be, that used to
be a death sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, you know,
you learn solutions were so easy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing is like, yeah,
especially Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I thought, I thought life was
over when we first got Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what it took was a home grower going,
Hey, this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I, we got some sulfur micro
tile disperse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you can have, you can have 10,000
people work on something, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or you can be an ass and try to
curb out an additional a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: or 200,000 people that are going to work
on something.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, you know, I would always
harp on how important the home grower is
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think, I think that via that
Viroid will be solved by some guy growing
[SPEAKER_04]: in his, growing in his tent right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to try to find a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there's, there's a bunch of
things that play in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not just one virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hoplite and that we talk about,
but there's so many other pathogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not talking about that are
contributing to the problem, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different forms of
holla.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a variance of hoplite
and just like there is of COVID and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are worse than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe they have identified plants
that are resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, something with the anthocyanins,
but yeah, it's, it's real interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Kevin McKernan from medicinal
genomics, they've identified some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and other people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right that we will be
able to figure out what works with hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to identify, you know,
how to breed that stuff that's resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, but also we need to be able to test
genetic material to find out if it has
[SPEAKER_00]: problems because then we just don't need
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I mean by that is, is people way
smarter than us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way that are not just growers,
but also have the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll figure out a solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to be very clear on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, you're not throwing,
you're not throwing things at a wall to
[SPEAKER_04]: see what sticks, but when you look at the
grow community themselves, there is some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the most intelligent people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why, that's why I always find
it really weird when they, when people
[SPEAKER_04]: will be like, Oh, this stigma of the
stoners and this and that, because some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the, some of the best growers,
some of the brightest people unfortunately
[SPEAKER_04]: get to interact with on a regular basis
through, through social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where ultimately, like I said,
is this, that's where the problems get
[SPEAKER_04]: solved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, on the commercial side of
stuff, if I was a commercial grower,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would tap into the home grower,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would find the people that love hunting
and go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just keep you flush with
packs, keep hunting it, find the best one,
[SPEAKER_04]: send it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, this is now your,
your job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even need to come to my
facility, all that stuff, because,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's so much talent out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many people that all they like to
do, all they would like love to do is
[SPEAKER_04]: hunt, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you tap into that because
you know how dangerous it is to hunt in a
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial facility, because you got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a ton, ton of variables there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a ton of, a ton of issues,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it sucks that we're in the thick
of it, but it's like anything that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: encountered before.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a matter of if it's a matter of
when we find the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the, some of the solutions are going
to come in the via of the way of snake
[SPEAKER_04]: oil, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to come other solutions
that are coming in and a true viable
[SPEAKER_04]: solution, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And also too, if the first time it doesn't
work, try something else, but keep trying,
[SPEAKER_04]: never stop trying, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you'll eventually get
there, but it's a, it's just tragic
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's a, it's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will continue to be a big thing and
it's devastating a lot of people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think things like sour diesel that
we thought just got weak, we didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand what was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the early vectors of hoplite
and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I remember sour diesel as
being this amazing thing and it had been
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I show you some sour diesel that I
got earlier, but it had been years since I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually saw a real cut of sour diesel,
but that's mostly because everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: switched over from growing sour diesel to
Gorilla Glue, especially in California and
[SPEAKER_00]: in Sonoma, Mendocino and Humboldt,
because the sour had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it was a longer flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gorilla Glue in some ways was superior
as far as harvest, although the turps,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now, yeah, name your price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got good sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, back to, back to what we were
talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you got a 10 week or more
people, the commercial farms aren't going
[SPEAKER_04]: to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real estate is expensive in the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, when it comes to that
diversity, but also going through those
[SPEAKER_04]: steps and trying to figure out how you're
going to fix that and correct that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: HLVD today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be something tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always going to be something
on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, I wish it would,
at this point, it would go to university
[SPEAKER_04]: study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unbiased.
[SPEAKER_04]: University study.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way you get the full picture of
it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unbiased because like we have a great
program up in the Northwest at UW.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the UW Hash Plant is how we
created the platinum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So UW has had a cannabis program for 25
years, you know, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: something like that that's equipped that
University of Mississippi, which has
[SPEAKER_04]: actually been, they've been studying
cannabis for 55 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a ton of money from, from the
government.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they say they're not studying it,
they're lying to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the arguments about a
schedule three.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we get to study it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, no, they're just
choosing not to, or not necessarily full
[SPEAKER_04]: on full fledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But out of that, just like hops,
you'd get a solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so until we get there,
it's just, you have a private sector,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's working on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Private sector is for profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately ended up in a gatekeeper
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like we talked about pharma
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, as crazy as sounds there,
I think there's plenty of cures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think what they do to it,
they do this, shelve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it, you know, ain't no money in
cures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, keep them, keep them coming,
keep them turning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I just hope that cannabis doesn't
go by that way side where it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll sell you the solution,
but we're going to sell you the treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not the actual solution of it,
you know, but that's the commercialization
[SPEAKER_04]: of everything in this country and how it
shakes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the cool part is,
is you're not going to stop learning,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I don't talk about it in
depth is because just like everybody else,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm learning more about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm learning from people that are way
smarter than me and seeing what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: having to say about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then continuing doing, doing my
research on the, on the subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that you bring it up quite a bit,
you know, and talk to just about every
[SPEAKER_04]: guest about it to get their, get their
opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you get a little snippet of,
of good information from a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_04]: that you've talked to in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much information out there
and so many opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that goes with
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you don't talk to people,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ain't going to learn nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've learned so much from doing
this show, uh, from, from the guests and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have so many people that are smart,
uh, in their own, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, in what, and they specialize in
certain things like Reggie from Steep
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill, you know, originally from Steep
Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at Front Range Biosciences now,
but you know, that was a great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guy is highly intelligent, extremely good
at what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also too, what I really liked about that
particular one was when he conveyed the
[SPEAKER_04]: information, he conveyed it in a way where
a vast majority of people understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't get too technical with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can sit here and you get real
technical with a lot of stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gets lost in translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of PhDs can't break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody understands.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I think what you should do is
create a, third chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way when the PhD says something,
you got the person that'll break it down
[SPEAKER_04]: for the people at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm just messing with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like speaking about PhDs,
doctors, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, uh, like right now there's a,
there's a, there's a lady out of Oregon
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm a huge fan of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's her name's, uh, Myabe Shields.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: She gets on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: She got, she got a story, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, this is how I took care of
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what I'm going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to explain my journey and what I
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it helps you, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not, at least you'll learn something
along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I see her posters or her stories
or posts posts, I make a point to put it
[SPEAKER_04]: in our story, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I feel it's what people need to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another guy out there that's an
actual medical doctor or Sean Hodge,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had a family practice, but also
too, he's the one that I was watching him
[SPEAKER_04]: on, on a, on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's the one that really went in depth
about the CB1 and CB2 receptors and how
[SPEAKER_04]: they fill up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also gives you a little bit of background
and how pharmacology works, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had a family practice, so he wasn't
beholden to have to pump people up with
[SPEAKER_04]: antidepressants, this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's one thing that we didn't touch
on, but even with hemp and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's a solution there to
be had when it comes to antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd be, and then also to ADHD,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, finding that combination, what it's
going to take to get there is the key is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is the key factor to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's, there's a,
there's a, there's a solution to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's potential solutions out
there with psychedelics as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been explored and they will
be explored.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's like, uh, it's going to
have to be us to be vocal about it to say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we want to at least try this because
when it comes to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: understand when it comes to
antidepressants and ADHD medication,
[SPEAKER_04]: it changes your brain chemical makeup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally over time changes it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gone to the doctor for a checkup and
the doctor starts asking me, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: how you feeling?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, sometimes it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, how many stress days you have
all this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I, you know, you got your good days,
you got your bad days and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, somehow my medical records ended
up putting on the way I had, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: at some point a prescription for
antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, so if I came into the
hospital incapacitated, you guys would
[SPEAKER_04]: have pumped me through full of these,
you know, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, but it just goes to
show how easy it is not to say that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not effective, not to say that it doesn't
help people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the, at the rate that it is
prescribed to people, I think there's
[SPEAKER_04]: alternatives for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't necessarily have to have to go
that route.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I think the cannabis hemp
and that aspect coming out will kid people
[SPEAKER_04]: off the dependency of drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also too, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a heroin, fentanyl crisis,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's shown great results in helping
people with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you're coming off of that,
the biggest fear for people, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the pain that you're going to go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, part of the problem with medicine,
you know, Western medicine, especially is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want to put it all in a nice
little box, but our body chemistries are
[SPEAKER_00]: so unique and so different that what works
for one person doesn't always work for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we're starting to
understand, uh, you know, as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and, you know, inherit inherited
problems, but these body chemistries are
[SPEAKER_00]: so unique to the individual that we,
as individuals need to understand that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to try different things potentially
and try multiple different things to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand medicine for ourselves,
you know, so we have to take steps for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves as individuals, which,
you know, the government and not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the government, but doctors in
general want to classify you as a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need this, this, and this,
and they have an SOP based on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always so cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of using cannabis
and psychedelics for all these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're really hard for doctors to
quantify.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understand your medical history and your
family history, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it, is a great start and huge start
because I think when you see the basically
[SPEAKER_04]: CHS and a few other things coming on,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you have a onset in your family
or yourself of psychosis, this is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: trigger it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a matter of if it's a matter of when,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to always factor that in,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the, uh, but also other, other,
other, uh, medical issues that you,
[SPEAKER_04]: that you might have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, it's education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's, you know, where a lot
of this stuff comes up short is the lack
[SPEAKER_04]: of education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people sometimes maybe they don't want
to feel like they're not like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they're afraid to ask or afraid
to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, uh, the better, the more people
talk about it, the quicker and faster
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to get a solution,
you know, but you have to understand your
[SPEAKER_04]: body.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand, you know,
uh, you're, you're also to your family
[SPEAKER_04]: history, you know, that way that we can
make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just anything in life when it comes
to, when it comes to, uh, medical aspects
[SPEAKER_04]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have a very open doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's open to hearing all my crazy ideas
and tells me which ones are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a very open, uh, relationship
as far as conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can have a good conversation
about why I use this or why I use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Crohn's and I have ulcerative
colitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both in remission right now,
but, uh, it's really interesting because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have a doctor like that,
you should find a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you enjoy cannabis,
especially that you can have that real
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with your doctor about why
you use it or, you know, or alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, you know, I'm a huge fan of
alternative medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sucks when you, when you,
when it gets the terminology of that,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when it comes to nature,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where all solutions are is in
nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where we run into a problem when it
comes to medication is when you synthesize
[SPEAKER_04]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Synthetics do not do well in the human
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's synthetic foods too,
processed synthetic processed foods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like I was saying, is this,
that's why I was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis is safest.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the safest, if not the safest
product on the market when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you're going to ingest,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because our food is sprayed with all round
up everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what that said though is,
is like, yeah, the, if, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you had hemp that was say running,
you know, growing wild, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That means the cows are going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that those cannabinoids are
going to be in the meat that you eat,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But when, but as, when you look at
history, right, when we started doing
[SPEAKER_04]: processed foods, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: High fructose corn syrup is terrible for
you, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and you know, it's more or worse than,
than the alternative, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When your solution, your solution is worse
than, you know, your new thing is worse
[SPEAKER_04]: than what it was before, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, but that's how you're able to
capture a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus at the time when they went to high
fructose corn syrup, we had a big,
[SPEAKER_04]: huge sugar situation down South,
you know, uh, there's a lot of politics
[SPEAKER_04]: that go into reasons why we have things
the way that they are, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but, uh, but yeah, when it comes to,
when it comes to that is, is nature in
[SPEAKER_04]: itself will heal itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why even with, um, like whether,
which side of the fence people fall in
[SPEAKER_04]: global warming or, you know, choking our
oceans with the plastic, I can tell you
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother earth is going to correct it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either with us or without us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not matter because that's not
going to stop, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so that's where, you know,
we have to kind of look at a lot of this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff and stop treating this planet in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we have another place to go,
you know, but, uh, but you got to protect
[SPEAKER_04]: nature because we're going to lose stuff
that is going to be critical for this
[SPEAKER_04]: generations, future generations and et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just a normal, you know,
die off of, of certain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things, but you know, I think everything
that's that we have an issue right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: we could, we could find a solution in
nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the first actual,
I guess would be Canada's or cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: death, you know, contributed would be a
synthetic product kind of similar,
[SPEAKER_04]: like how the Flocker or whatever the
synthetic cannabinoids would make people
[SPEAKER_04]: go crazy, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the news is going to completely gloss
over that fact and just attack the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: itself, even though the plant didn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause by itself, it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to a degree with our breeding,
we're screwing it up that it's not in its
[SPEAKER_00]: natural habit inhabitants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it thrives and does the best
as far as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I disagree on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why I disagree on that is
because we're constantly learning and
[SPEAKER_04]: evolving, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take yourself as an example from what
I've saw today, what's talking to you and
[SPEAKER_04]: your plans and what you're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, that's, that says you're on a great
path.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're bringing and bringing it back the
other way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You recognized now where it was going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to steer the ship over to this
way.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so, so when you see that you're
not alone, there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_04]: also witnessed that and seen that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we went down this crazy path,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that path is now we're starting
to see, you know, the wall at the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: that path.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to kind of, you know,
turn it out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you, myself, a lot of these
people around are seeing the writing on
[SPEAKER_04]: the wall and hearing what people are
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And going to, you know, going to correct
the ship, but, but it comes to where we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't care in a sense, whether it's
sanctioned or not, we're going to do it
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what, what scares a lot
of the powers that be is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, we can't get rid of it because
they'll just take it back underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like as an example, when,
um, when they, when the title,
[SPEAKER_04]: want to say the name or what about it,
but you know, when they told everybody to
[SPEAKER_04]: go home and stay there, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until further notice the States were so
greedy that they were like, keep the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries open.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't because they was for your
greater good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want that tax money to stop
rolling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in Washington, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's, there's,
they're not there for your, for your
[SPEAKER_04]: greater good, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where you're kind of like,
um, you know, when you start seeing all
[SPEAKER_04]: this, all this stuff and coming in and,
and you're recognizing it, but I,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really, you know, a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially after what I saw today in
the direction you're going, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super excited to, to see where you,
where you go with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't want to go into depth
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't know if it's, if it's a
secret or not, but no, no, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be as transparent as possible for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, there's some formulas and
stuff that we're working on and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and things that we're doing that,
you know, we keep under wraps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the, like, just like with my book,
there's no secrets in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I tell everybody what I do and
what I'm doing and I try to put as much
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic information out there as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the little guy can compete with
the big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's part of what I think is
valuable, where I think us together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not competing against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, you know, competing against big
pharma and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you know, you could, you could,
uh, argue, but, uh, I think the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is authenticity too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's like, when it comes to,
when it comes to competition, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we can do the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can still be friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to, we're going to do this
exchange, go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing is, is like, especially in house
in particular, we don't, we'll never see
[SPEAKER_04]: us knock somebody else's work or what
they're doing or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you, if you're a terrible person or
whatever, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that's a little bit different,
but when it comes to people's work,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, you'll never see a knock come from,
come from that direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just because we're a fan of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a fan of the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a fan of what, what people do,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the same sentiment along your
lines, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I see what you're doing,
I don't like it as competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't look like if you're behind or if
you're ahead, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this, now I got this direct
connection with this person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be in the loop with what he's
doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to share my information and so on
and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately that was end results as
they, you know, start to come out as a
[SPEAKER_04]: better situation, not just for us,
but everybody else that's, that's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be Gore-Tex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not trying to be Nike or the other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to collaborate with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to work with other people and,
you know, at, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you break it down, we're just
stewards of the plant and hopefully we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in a good direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the, I like some aspects and some
I'm against, but the, the direction of the
[SPEAKER_04]: core people and the way that, you know,
the, the, the core, I guess a core group
[SPEAKER_04]: of people, I really liked that direction
because it's a core of fighters.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a core of people that, that come from
a, you know, come from a history.
[SPEAKER_04]: There, there's, there's that, there's that
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that gives me great hope that,
Hey, you know, when, when push comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: shove, you're going to get shoved and,
you know, and if the, if it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: getting, you know, having to slap somebody
in the mouth, you know, right,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's the FDA or whoever it is,
you're going to have the power of the
[SPEAKER_04]: people to back you to do that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like, you know, that's one thing is
like, even when I was touched a bit on the
[SPEAKER_04]: FDA, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All the people that head the FDA,
when they leave the FDA 61st day,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're sitting on a board of
pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, you know, I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never talked down to somebody getting
their money, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, that's that,
that is crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just the same people you're
supposed to regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you work for them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that, that kind of, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so as far as us being stewards,
I feel like there's a big responsibility
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to do good with it, but also we're
working on the shoulders of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that came before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lot of the breeding work has
been done over the last, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're refining it in a way that
they didn't do, but a lot of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: start, you know, especially in the last 40
years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's pretty amazing how
far the plan has come in the last 40
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about the folks up in Humboldt that
jumped on a plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we're on the same latitude
as, uh, Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go spend some time over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go learn about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they smuggle those, those seats back
in just from that action.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how much change and innovation that's
completely changed the game a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: percent, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's where, you know,
that's, you know, these, those little
[SPEAKER_04]: pockets, those little stories and those
types of things is yes, you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: respect the people that came before you,
but not only that learn from them,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's just like people are going
to learn from the things that we do,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's, it's a, it's a generational
thing, you know, and that's really,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can, like I said, if you can touch
one person and they learn from you and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, Hey, you know, then,
then you did your job.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did, you did what you're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made your small little pocket that
much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, you're, you're that
impact on the, on the world, but
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, especially a lot
of people that should be vocal and should
[SPEAKER_04]: be out in the open were so traumatized by
the bogus war on drugs that they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like being in a bomb shelter
for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they thought Cuba was sending the
missiles over and then they come out and
[SPEAKER_04]: they've made movies about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything's changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's too, like, those are great
sources of information, but they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: been, you know, beat down, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and lied to and propaganda that they,
they're afraid to, they think that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get arrested for even just
talking about what they did in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a lot of people,
I've met a lot of people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got one last question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to look back at your younger
self that had been in the industry for one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two years, what is the one piece of
advice you would give your younger self?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just remind the, just kind of the
reminder of, of the dark days lead to the
[SPEAKER_04]: better sunny days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, it's, it's hard to say
because when you, when you really break it
[SPEAKER_04]: down, when you think about it,
it's like, what would you tell your
[SPEAKER_04]: younger self?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've even had this conversation with a
couple of people is like the way
[SPEAKER_04]: everything panned out and everything
worked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if I'd even want to
tamper with that by giving a little
[SPEAKER_04]: insight, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because every little thing, all those hard
days, all those good days, all that stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: accumulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make you, you know, the person you are,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and how, and how it shaped out,
you know, it's just like when you go even
[SPEAKER_04]: farther back when you're a kid and yeah,
child, you know, terrible childhood,
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole nine, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chose not to make it an excuse,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm going to build off of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to teach me, it's going to
teach me not to get into harsh drug habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know I see seen in my childhood
what it does, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you get those types of
questions, like what kind of advice,
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather go back and, and kind of watch
it and see, you know, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and reminisce that way, but I don't
know if I'd really want to give myself
[SPEAKER_04]: advice because I think it would change my
trajectory and the things that I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would, it would be a total
different outcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those type of questions are, are hard for
me because I really pride myself on
[SPEAKER_04]: overcoming the adversities, overcoming the
stuff that, you know, overcoming the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that was supposed to take you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I really value friendships.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really value a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I have some of the same friends
from when I, you know, when I went to
[SPEAKER_04]: school, sorry to disappoint you on that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that was, that was a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we get this wide amount of,
you know, the diversity and the answers is
[SPEAKER_00]: all across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think my younger self would literally
tell me to fuck off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the language, but you know,
it'd be like, beat it, beat old man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the mentality you've always had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, I got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, or, you know, um, like even with my
partner, we joke all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's like, for us to kind of inquire
like, Oh, extra help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or something like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you're, you're stubborn like,
Oh, I'm just going to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, you know, we're on that same path,
but it's like anything, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just, you're just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're no matter how hard it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it, it makes it a pretty
interesting, interesting dynamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's, uh, that's one of the
things where, you know, when you,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you look at those types of questions
or those hypothetical questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, I don't know if I'd want to
change anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not end up in the same position.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one's ever asked me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was to go back and, you know,
I would say, don't worry about the small
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know, one foot in front of the
other and everything's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be my big answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's, that's one,
my big takeaway is that it's all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be bad days and
there's going to be great days and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to live in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about the destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the journey and enjoying every
single moment you're alive because you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know when it's going to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's interested in finding more
about you, uh, where can they get you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can they go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they can find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can find us on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the issues with that is,
is, uh, our accounts are usually in the
[SPEAKER_04]: thirties or 50,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how, you know, you have the,
have the real one, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We still kind of got that mentality where
it's like, if you, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: us, you're going to find us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to stress to this in-house does
absolutely no sales whatsoever over social
[SPEAKER_04]: media, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or email or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Telegram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Telegram.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't stress it enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you see our logo trying to sell you
something automatically know that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, we pride ourselves on our seed
banks, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are great folks, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll make sure that you never get
scammed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you ever have an issue,
they will take care of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That prevents a lot of, lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, look forward to communicating with you
in the future and potentially collaborate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
