I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, our special guest is Jake from
Romulan Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Jake?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you finally got to come on the
show, because we've rescheduled this a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about doing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your contributions to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met online.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have amazing photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right away when I saw your photos,
I was like, man, this guy knows what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing as far as photography and with
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your growing is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the way you breed, because
you've bred Romulan into so many other
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've really stuck with that,
whereas a lot of people are creating all
[SPEAKER_01]: these different F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of had a game plan going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Romulan is part of your
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe I'm still here doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still here breeding Romulan and people
actually liking it and buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense to me,
but it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started out with this, I found
myself like the steward and the caretaker
[SPEAKER_00]: of this cut that had been in my family for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started giving it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up gifting it to Dark Heart
Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dan got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave it to all the legacy farmers and
luminaries, all the people in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grew it out for a couple of
years, verifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of thought that was like the
end of the road for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to get the cut out,
get it in enough people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Heart started selling it,
and they were selling thousands of cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had people in Canada and Europe
asking me, make seeds, because I can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess I'll buckle down and make
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all just kind of like a little
side quest thing I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made little labels and created
Romulan genetics, just kind of like as a
[SPEAKER_00]: joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to send these seeds out,
and this is it, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this, I had a great career.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they got the seeds,
they were like, oh, this is like the best
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan I've ever grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make FEMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you helped me kind of pinpoint down
with some advice on how to get the FEMS
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as I got the Feminize
stuff out, I'm like, OK, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people said, make crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started making crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next thing I knew, it just blew up,
got out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I retired about two or three years ago
from what I was doing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do this full time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's a beautiful place to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people, you know,
you hear different sides of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're passionate about it,
it's a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is no bad time to be alive,
as far as I'm concerned, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like with all these crosses
and then to be able to go back to stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like Romulan and Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're even doing Blue Dream Romulan
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think working with some of these
older genetics, they're very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lot of people don't understand is
some of these older things, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are so much more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream, if you self it, you get four
expressions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically four expressions,
four different, you know, typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within that, there's there's some
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like really, you'll have some
outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly four things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's mainly four things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll get a dead ringer for Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure Romulan is similar to that,
where it's super stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when you breed it, you'll get a very
uniform expressions, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll help stabilize with other things
you can stabilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole Romulan thing for me was,
you know, one, it was it was my dad and I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like a little bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dad had passed and I got the cut and I got
to keep this alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started smoking it, though,
it was like it was life changing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It genuinely was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got off at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of nerve damage from my
Marine Corps service and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on 40,000 milligrams a day of
gabapentin, which is a nerve blocker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I mean, I could slice my hand
open, grab a hot pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even fucking feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor said you can never wean
yourself off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never get off this medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that get on gabapentin,
once you cross over like the 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram a day mark, there is no weaning
off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have these episodes of nerve
damage pain where I would just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like be bedridden for a week or
two sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'd be really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd feel like I was on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was ice and frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like stabbing pain, all different
types and just randomly all over,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually in my joints and my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like really bad arthritis was what it
was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just hit me out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for like 10 years, I couldn't really,
I didn't have much of a life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I worked from home doing
electrical engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really hold any kind of regular
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to have something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good career thankfully,
but it was really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed after I, you know,
got through a couple of harvests of
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan and I'm smoking it, I would smoke
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a special occasion weed
for me because it was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't have an episode for like a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started putting it together over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told my doctor, I want to get off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff, this Gabapentin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a plan and she's like,
you're going to fuck yourself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to be back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two weeks, I weaned off the Gabapentin
just by smoking Romulan every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then I've kept smoking Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, crosses and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I'm like back on mountain
biking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm snowboarding again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't done that stuff since I was 25,
30 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I'm back to living life
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a big part of me where it's
like, you know, it was, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical part to it where I wanted to kind
of give this gift back out to people and
[SPEAKER_00]: help everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the breeding side of it, you know,
I really enjoy the smoke, the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's kind of like, I think of it,
she's like a key, like a genetic key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can breed her with pretty much
anything I want, like three quarters of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that I breed her with.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll open up in just a beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll make something brand new or,
you know, go off in this new direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not like Jack where you breed
it with a lot of things and you come out
[SPEAKER_01]: with Jack, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get different expressions that
certain genetics breed really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain genetics don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people, they'll breed
stuff in and like a lot of the gelato
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: With gelato, there's phenotypical
variation and there's because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: stable for one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, and you can only have so
much gelato in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with Romulan, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen some of your crosses in
the way they express the, as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: morphology, man, some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're across the board because
Romulan is a hybrid, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning towards the Indica side of the
hybrid, as far as morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also, you get big, huge butts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a big producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people had Joe's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Sleikerman was what everyone knows is
Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have experienced his cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone has had the Vick High cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both acquired their cuts from people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vick High said where he got his,
Joe never really told anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, I've talked to so many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Sean, who was Joe Sleikerman's
best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the early high times
cannabis cup seeds guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was best friends with him through all
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, you know, he never said
he bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never really said where he got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people had his cut and they
didn't really try the Vick High stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vick High is like a dwarf sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got hybrid effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a little bit of it,
you get energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a shitload of it,
it just puts you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like it that I can,
I can have like half a joint, smoke a bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: of it in the morning, in the afternoon,
anytime I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm centered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really want to get over saturated,
I just smoke a little bit more and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just fucking out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been known for, you know,
I remember it from the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nineties, early two thousands in the
Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was clones available of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken from beyond bomb extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what his clone company was,
but I believe he had it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there was, there was access to good
flower back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I feel like the flower back then
was better on average than the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people might disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I disagree or whatever, but like,
from my perspective, I think there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more passionate people and it was all
craft, you know, back then it wasn't big
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 lighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was six lighters, four lighters,
10 lighters, 10 lighters was big back
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, there wasn't a ton of 10
lighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of stuff was like six or less grown
in the houses or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people were maybe in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't blowing up a condo on the
beach somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were doing that in the,
in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we had an eight lighter,
you know, my business partner had 12 eight
[SPEAKER_01]: lighters when I had one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like it's, it's one of those
things I, you know, but, but now we got a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred lighters and 200 lighters and
thousand watts or a thousand thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, we're in a different
world, but there wasn't as much as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's thousands and thousands of
crosses, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and some stuff available names
available, but as far as the diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was so much more diversity back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, I don't feel like I'm
going to meet as many people anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I used to, I mean, I used to do
interstate trafficking and travel to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and pick up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you'd meet people that had like
this heirloom cut or they've had it for 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else has it, but them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they bred it, their wife bred
it, something, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just the most unique,
different thing you would ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the smell, the effects,
the taste, everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Hey, nobody else has
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm going to give you a
really small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think we're kind of trying to go
back in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people, even, even big name
breeders that were breeding all this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of going back to working with
some of the older genetics, but
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's really become homogenized to
a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with the thought process of how
do we move forward from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in Europe, the Hayes made their
wave with the Hayes and then everything
[SPEAKER_01]: got homogenized over there and they lost a
lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think cookies was really the
beginning of the end in some ways for our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, as far as diversity in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I look up in the hills,
you know, we go up to grass valley,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we go up into the Emerald triangle and
they're still cranking out amazing flour
[SPEAKER_01]: that's diverse.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, not too long ago, had a whole come
to Jesus moment when I tried John's white
[SPEAKER_00]: thorn rose and I had to hit him up right
away and was like, where'd this come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Oh, it's been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's been quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the white thorn Romulan would be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I think that would be a
great, great cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a similar kind of centering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got something special here, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ZDP is my white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, that was the motivation when we
were doing the phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this one plant out of the,
out of the phenohunt we did, we got a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of keepers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a lot of stuff that we want to grow
again and see how it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not winners, but definitely keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the progeny, there was one
standout.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just a far outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has the GDP floral along with the
candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also has the color too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got that GDP color with that
floral note that is very specific to GDP
[SPEAKER_01]: with a little candy hint on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a little sweetness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually gifting this cut to John
so he can grow it out and do some crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm excited to collaborate
with Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and Jason are doing, you know,
they're doing the Lord's work up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, you know, it's really hard to do
outdoor production or greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up there with the way things have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people have fallen off,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like a lot of the guys that are
still here are doing it because they love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's in your freaking blood,
you know, you can't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you see, you know,
in your life, when you see cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: miracles, like when you're talking about
being able to cut out gabapentin,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just makes it that much more
real that you're, you're doing the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're on the right path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things that I had of
a cannabis miracle is this guy hit me up
[SPEAKER_00]: and his dad, since he came back from the
Vietnam war, it had night terrors,
[SPEAKER_00]: just couldn't function at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't sleep in the same room with his
wife, let alone the same bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hadn't slept in the same bed
since 1978.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made his dad some Rick Simpson oil
out of either my Romulan, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: my Romulan, feminized seeds, or maybe it
was a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave it to his dad and within a week they
were sleeping in the same bed together and
[SPEAKER_00]: he doesn't have night terrors anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like completely changed his
life for the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that and it was like, there really
isn't anything that I can do to help out
[SPEAKER_00]: people more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, you know, what I was doing
with electrical engineering, I was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: life safety design, architectural design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a protecting people kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always been that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always kind of steered towards that
being a protector and helping out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so meaningless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, it's a fire alarm system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find their way out of the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: This though, actually changed someone's
life completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I don't, I don't know that I'll
ever be able to do anything else again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's so hard to argue that it,
you know, as far as I see it making the
[SPEAKER_01]: world a better place on a, on a daily
basis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I see this plant making people's
lives better, improving the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tenfold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many other things that kind
of take away from it, but it's so hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: argue that this plant is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's still people out there
that are like, you know, the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the devil, the devil's lettuce,
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, slowly but surely we're changing
people's minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you only need to see one cannabis
miracle to believe in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of those things,
like whether someone has cancer and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden they can eat again or it cures
cancer, you know, but, but even just the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that when you're on chemotherapy and
you can take it and now you can eat food,
[SPEAKER_01]: how can you argue that somebody doesn't
need it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it should be their choice
or some kid who has seizures that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD to relieve the seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could you want to take that away from
a child?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's just cruel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially cause it's a plant,
you know, it's, it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me about your father.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had his faults.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he was born and raised in the thirties
in Utah and he ran away, go to Disneyland,
[SPEAKER_00]: stole a car and ran away and came to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never went back when he was like 14,
15 or 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always worked in the oil field
industry, worked oil rigs and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point in the sixties,
he started selling, he started selling
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, coke, LSD, pills, and it was kind of
like a progressive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine eventually he was like entwined
with the hell's angels from the Ventura
[SPEAKER_00]: chapter all the way up into Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the seventies, he was like the number
one drug dealer in the Tri County area.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind of like a mini George Jung,
you know, that is, he was selling weed to
[SPEAKER_00]: Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles and Michael
Jackson and he had all these albums that
[SPEAKER_00]: were signed, you know, thanks for bringing
the party, G Dub from the Eagles and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, I grew up, you know,
in the late seventies around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a constant fucking party
nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd go to work and he'd get home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd meet him at the fence with a beer,
even, you know, when I was like three and
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd get big beer and he'd come in and hit
his bong and then the party would start.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would show up and it was like that
every damn night, just about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, he was a really good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a protector.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was what he instilled in
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the kind of guy where if someone
went tearing down the street in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, hauling ass and the kids
were out playing, he'd go find who that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy was and break his jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just like, you don't
drive like that with kids playing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: street, but he was a really good guy,
but he had his faults.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know until not too long ago that
him and my mom hooked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was 36 and she was 16, 14, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a different time back
then and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hearing that now I'm like,
yeah, my dad was a fucking pedophile,
[SPEAKER_00]: like freaking out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom's like, no, it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everyone knew it wasn't like somebody
we were hiding, but it's still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he had his faults.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of illegal shit, but he was a
really good guy, took care of everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: around him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, still to this day,
don't know how he pulled it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was entwined with like the early
version of the Cali cartel, the Hells
[SPEAKER_00]: Angels, really dangerous people,
high level drug dealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just stopped one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how he got away with it,
but he just walked away from it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our house got raided two or three
times when I was a kid and the phone would
[SPEAKER_00]: ring an hour or two ahead of time and he'd
clear the house out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was getting tipped off that he was
getting raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at that high of a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was across the street one time
watching through my neighbor's window,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all these cops are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last time he got raided,
I think it scared the shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forgot he had books of acid wrapped and
he had frozen meat in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put, you know, aluminum foil
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put the acid sheets over that
and another thing of aluminum foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd have to open it up to find them
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting, you know,
nothing's happening with the meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, there was just,
you know, three or four books of acid in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just one sheet would have been
enough to throw me in prison the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was kind of like the,
no, you're not going to do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, I mean, it was like five years old
and he's telling me how to, people come in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where you get the gun and here's
the gun in the safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're standing here and I'm open
on the safe and there's a guy holding the
[SPEAKER_00]: gun, I'm going to pull this gun out and
shoot him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like five years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was learning a lot of stuff you don't
learn when you're a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes for an interesting childhood though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sure did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your father's relationship with
the Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, as part of that, he was,
he was growing in the backyard and him and
[SPEAKER_00]: his buddy Clyde started kind of breeding
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go on these camping trips,
like during the summer, especially where
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd drive all the way up to Oregon or
Washington, just on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: border of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there would be, you know, a shitload
of hell's angels, but the main crew that
[SPEAKER_00]: my dad would be hanging out with would be
all these older veteran guys, guys who had
[SPEAKER_00]: served in different wars and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all stuff that I kind of
picked up being around him and stuff we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about when I was a little older,
but they would trade seeds back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was, this was like the early
version of what ended up becoming Romulan
[SPEAKER_00]: because Joe called it Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then they were, you know,
they all had like different names for it
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pinebud was one of them, but they were
Canadian Korean, war vets had brought back
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of Korean Thai, which was probably
just Thai, but who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were growing it up in Canada and
the Vancouver BC area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it was a Thai, they just had a
shit, you know, shit time growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was before I think anyone was
growing indoor back in the fifties and
[SPEAKER_00]: sixties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they started like with this
collective and the camping trips and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started, you know, Hey, I crossed it
with this back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this Mexican, this real good plant
and crossed it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here's the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were doing that for years and
years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dad was part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, you know, this small little
sliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't, some people kind of
misconstrued things like, Oh, your dad
[SPEAKER_00]: bred Romulan?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he didn't at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was a small part, small slice of
this bigger collective of guys who were
[SPEAKER_00]: trading seeds back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it sounded to me like they weren't
really intentionally breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of like, let's see if we
can make it easier to grow every now and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they'd have something new to cross it
with and see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they crossed it with a Mexican
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa and then a Colombian, probably red,
Colombian sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Afghani showed up on the scene and,
you know, 79, 80, 81, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they crossed it with that and they
hated the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they went and crossed it back the
result to the Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like Eureka.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden the plant was a little
shorter, much heartier, could handle a
[SPEAKER_00]: cold, didn't have this crazy branching
problem where they had to support every
[SPEAKER_00]: single thing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was kind of their Eureka
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was what eventually ended up
becoming Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild that, you know,
it's so funny because I feel like most
[SPEAKER_01]: people see the genetics today,
whether it's the gelatos or the OG
[SPEAKER_01]: cushions, and they don't understand the
lives that touch that plant to get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: where it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Romulan is a great example of
stuff that started, you know, 50s and 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about 60 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kept the plant alive,
kept seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all just stewards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, we're all just,
you know, we should look at ourselves as
[SPEAKER_01]: stewards that are trying to pass this
plant on for another 60, 100, 200 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I think 200 years ago or 200
years from now, they're probably not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to look back and be like, oh, well,
this person did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a handful of people that
get some credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with technology, a lot more people
will get credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, there's been people for the last
2000 years that have carried this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so we're only working on
the shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't even be messing with it right
now if it wasn't for shamans and people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a thousand, two thousand plus
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the stuff that ended up,
you know, it was semi land race at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it wasn't just full land race,
but people were working with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went from feral, completely feral,
indigenous feral, to stuff that went on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Silk Road and went all over the world,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from Egypt to islands,
you know, Indonesia and all over,
[SPEAKER_01]: all over South America, Central America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows how long it's really been
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, I think we only understand
it to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think history, we only understand to
a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you on that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we know back far enough,
but same thing with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we keep finding new things where
they found, you know, some archeological
[SPEAKER_00]: dig and they realize, oh crap,
it goes back another 2000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabis use or it goes back another
3000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that day keeps getting pushed back
further and further of when they think we
[SPEAKER_00]: were using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need some good time traveling now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go check it out for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back strain collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the real land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before it got all washed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, I think there's a big confusion
on what land race really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people think land race is
feral and feral is land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand land race is
basically something that was cultivated,
[SPEAKER_01]: purposely cultivated bread for a purpose.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So land race from Africa was bred,
whether it's for the drug use or for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain plants were grown for textiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can take like crucifers,
like wild mustard, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,500 years ago, wild mustard was just
wild mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they bred it into things like
kale, things like cabbage, Brussels
[SPEAKER_01]: sprouts, broccoli, all these things are,
you know, they started out 2,500 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wild mustard, but they were,
you know, they selected the plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: grew for the strongest leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most beautiful leaves were things like
kale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they went for the bud
structure or the flower structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, things like cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at a Brussels sprout,
it looks like a miniature cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the history of what we can do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intervening and putting ourselves in
between things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, pretty amazing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can happen to something, you know,
in cannabis and we're just scratching the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of what's possible with cannabis
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have a great foundation,
but the future is really bright too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as like, where we go in
the next 10 years with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: applying science to it, it could be pretty
wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be pretty scary to some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I mean, I'm, I'm pretty excited
about some of the stuff and the
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we start understanding receptors and
cannabinoids and how they work
[SPEAKER_01]: synergistically, along with terpenes and
flavorants or, you know, thiol,
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur based compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been like Leafworks DNA, if you know
who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to a bunch of the,
you know, the science head side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a real nerdy guy anyway, but you know,
they've already identified intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already identified a bunch of
different parts of the cannabis plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: all of us right off the bat want to
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, the future is really bright
as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound great to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as gene editing and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, I think it's, you know,
ignorance gets in the way of understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: the value of things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not really even going to
be our generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be people while we're still alive,
we'll be messing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, you know, a hundred years from
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't necessarily need gene
editing for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do data-driven breeding and,
you know, it's like, and then AI can
[SPEAKER_01]: compliment data-driven breeding by giving
us a path, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you have all your starting
materials you have all the information
[SPEAKER_01]: there, and then you want to go from here
to a specific trait.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter how far that goes,
we'll still have people in a basement or a
[SPEAKER_00]: closet just breeding off of, you know,
tactile, visual, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll always have the old methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need the human aspect of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's so subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality from me to you can be completely
subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I might like skittles and
candy or gas, and then you might like
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa or whatever it is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really matter, but it's
subjective to the individual and what
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is can determine, you know,
what quality is can change from person to
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and location to location, certain
places like, look at New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: they love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a point where it was like OG
Kush was LA, sour diesel was New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the Bay was cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and these things change over time
as they trend, quality can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like purple is an indicator of
quality now, unfortunately, which I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: a huge fan of the whole, because I feel
like a lot of the phenotypes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: green, if you look at the phenotypical
expression, the green ones have better
[SPEAKER_01]: terms or they're louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to admit, purple's got better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has gotten a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, I would, if you pulled out
something that was purple, I would have,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like GDP was an exception, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was GDP and there was Mendo perps,
but a lot of the perp had no, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it had flavor, but it didn't have
a hot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have legs to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I, my own complaint was it
didn't have legs to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavors were always like in the
same territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get the little miners, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was mostly floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly floral and it wasn't strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blackberry Kush, we didn't test for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we had that, like we had testing
back then, because the Blackberry Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that was up in Humboldt,
is the one that didn't test high in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like CBD weed for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would feel relaxed, but it didn't
get like, I could smoke huge bombers and
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff would not get me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first plants I grew with a
friend, you know, back in high school,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, just the most gorgeous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just psyched, geeked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally it gets dry enough and
I'm over it, just me and him and got this
[SPEAKER_00]: huge nug and we're going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, you know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were like, we smoked like
an ounce, you know, like to each,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, each one of us smoked like about
an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just like, I am not high at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't even know that was possible
back then, but we must've had something
[SPEAKER_00]: that was just, you know, had hardly any
THC to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like blaming the light that he
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't know what was going on,
what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in the nineties,
we had a guy that was growing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff was really good and it was like this
lime green bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had some purple and he had some
lime green bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is like from one harvest
to the next, it was always a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people had stuff that was
like slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had one time where it was like just
missing the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you would smoke it and it was
like, how did this go for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked the same, but it was like
smoking CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never even thought CBD back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you people were like, oh,
that's probably CBD and who knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like it completely changed to
something that got you really high to
[SPEAKER_01]: something that got you a little bit high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually not high at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then we didn't know, you know,
at all what to think of it or what to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't know what to blame it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that was a trip he was selling,
you know, like QP's people for 25 bucks or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, just use it for joint
fillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doesn't get you high at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have bubble hash back then too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this was before all the dabs and
before, you know, BHO, before rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: before BHO.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had good bubble hash back then and
Keef.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was really good Keef back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally you'd find someone with
really good Keef or we had scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we grew, we always had scissor hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still love scissor hash to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that back before bubble man
made the bags before we really had easy
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, there was a point
in the early nineties where you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: know someone that could get it from
Morocco or someplace else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just people didn't really have hash that
much around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was younger, that was like,
to me, that was, it still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think hash is just primo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still, if it's really good flour,
I don't even want to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want it as flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if someone's like, Hey, I've got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got this full melt hash
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I'm grabbing the full melt
hash, give me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel like there's good hash
varieties and there's good flour
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some flour varieties do not make good
hash and some hash varieties do not make
[SPEAKER_01]: good flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one example is Gatorade Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this new one my buddy's got and it's
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the extract, it smells like Gatorade
Frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally the rosin straight smells
like Gatorade.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flour is like, you get it a little
bit, but it's not nearly as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's real powdery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the bud, when you grind it up,
it's powdery, but man, it makes amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's just, again, we have these
things we're starting to breed in these
[SPEAKER_01]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Brussels sprouts and the cabbage,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I feel like, you know,
that's the future too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to really go in those
directions even more so and isolate stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that works well for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of the stuff now, if you look
at the extract, a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like GMOs or GMO derivatives,
you know, the papayas, the GMOs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that really dumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like all those within the
spectrum, but now people are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: get more stuff in those and they're going
to continue on that path for another
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have some really special
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that myself too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, there's a lot of,
I don't know what the number is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a lot of breeders that are,
their breeding line is focused towards
[SPEAKER_00]: raws in production, hash making,
dumpers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I always kind of crack up when I
see, you know, I have a lot of home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like a group of 200 testers that
are mostly home growers that work with me
[SPEAKER_00]: and help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see people grow on different things,
you know, and they're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, kind of, I got to step back
a little bit and not say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was meant to be washed, you know,
like the breeder, everyone across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board knows that's meant to be washed and,
you know, just take it that next step,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but it's, you know, let everyone
do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My banana Z is definitely one of those
ones that was meant to be watched.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure is not complimentary to good
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very open bud structure, but that's
great for washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bananas and candy, you can't go
wrong there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I, there's, there's other
banana Z's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine isn't the only one, but my banana Z I
believe was the first banana Z made in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a bunch of crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's, it's banana punch,
banana OG with Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I wanted to get regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I made, I turned into regs,
put it with the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the open bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the phenotypes we're, we're at F3
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we haven't gone too far,
but with the F3s, there's some really
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing washers in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: House of cultivars, phenohunted a bunch of
the stuff specifically for rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put the cross on a whole bunch
of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five different plants.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, but the ones that are really
amazing are all banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you can only, you only need
so many banana, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only, you know, and there's,
there's different types of banana too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a banana cream,
banana custard, you know, candy banana,
[SPEAKER_01]: banana nerds or banana runs, you know,
those kinds of turps, but there's only so
[SPEAKER_01]: many bananas that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like within each one of
those things, it's like, how many colors
[SPEAKER_01]: of red do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always more, but you don't need
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you only need the best ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it, then it's like, are you just
hoarding or are you, are you purposely
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting stuff or adding stuff to your
arsenal?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's talk about photography for
a little bit, because I feel like you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've gotten into videography too with
your videos, but your photography has been
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since I've known you, you've taken
amazing photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get into photography?
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially my grandfather was a pretty
famous photographer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a bunch of patents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was five, the rest of the family
hated me because he was like his,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was his favorite, you know, he came over
and he brought me this old, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: point and click, and you can adjust all
this stuff on adjust the F stop and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he taught me when I was like five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was, I was always a
pretty bright kid and ahead of my,
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of my days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he taught me and I messed around with
it for like three or four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I was just a little kid taking just,
you know, little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would go and bring my film roll to
the little shack and get my pictures back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love doing it, but it wasn't,
I wasn't serious about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I didn't do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing, you know, breeding and
all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are telling, you know,
I was giving away cuts and people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you got to go and join this
forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people in the forum are like,
let me get a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just taking shots with my cell phone
camera for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bought it just a cheap Canon
Rebel camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's most of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all my early stuff was just with that
cheap, you know, point and shoot kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a different way of looking at
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, grandpa helped me and I got
an artistic eye or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really should have in the early days
found a photography forum, took some
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just, it's all self-taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just taught myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a great camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got really expensive lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got full light setups like we have in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's professional now, but I had to
make like every mistake along the way
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times over and over again,
before I'd realize, Oh shit, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have the depth of field off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, you know, year after
year, eventually I got into macro and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had like the little manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn that little macro stepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using that initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got, you know, one that's a
motorized stepper and we'll do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a really great Cognizant one
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does, I've got a rotary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing all the video stuff is
actually stop motion is single image,
[SPEAKER_00]: each thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I stitch it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a button, a little rotary and
it spins just a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a picture, spins tiny,
but it takes a picture and just keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I can use any of those still
images, but I can also put it together and
[SPEAKER_00]: make a video that's been like the past two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to figure out how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a while it was, you know,
I was using like just a manual turntable
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, start with the grassroots,
you know, and get to the point where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, I need professional equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now I figured out this step,
this step and this step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the same thing with growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it with a bunch of other things
in life where it's, I like learning by
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like making the mistakes that helps me
learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone taught me exactly how to do it,
I could do it over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll never know like the full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just know this little pie slice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you make mistakes, you're like
venturing out over here to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're learning all these other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning the full spectrum of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, with photography,
that was a huge help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now it's like, I'm lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I set the lights up really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly, and I moved the lights
really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I would be like four hours for a
couple of shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now it's like, it takes me 15
minutes of work and the camera just does
[SPEAKER_00]: all the work for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd keep coming up and I changed the
memory card and started over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts its little spin thing or
starts the macro thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like almost effortless now,
but before in the past, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pouring sweat and didn't know what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sounds like my recipe for life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make as many mistakes as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will understand everything in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I feel like when you're
passionate, I always have lived a passion
[SPEAKER_01]: driven life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always following my passions,
whether it's weed or whether it's food or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I follow those things and I do them
because I love doing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, yeah, making mistakes along the
way is the best way to learn is by
[SPEAKER_01]: screwing shit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe not the fastest, but sometimes,
you know, I think it's the best way to get
[SPEAKER_01]: full understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a, it's a good life lesson
is if you want to do something,
[SPEAKER_01]: just go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to learn how to play
the guitar, go play the guitar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you're going to suck in the
beginning and you suck at almost
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it is, whether it's photography,
growing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I mean, my brother,
he had a green thumb maybe started,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, early on, my brother had a green
thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like for me, it took a long time
before I could grow stuff that was amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: or even stuff that I considered was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also had friends that grew really
well where I could compare my stuff to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my first couple of harvests were
not amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't great, but I really loved
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really loved flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really loved the process of
cultivating and I really wanted to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just kept on doing it and I'm
still doing it, you know, and it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: something I love doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's not fun anymore,
I probably won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same way it's a, but there is,
there's something special about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of people want to fast
track the way to learning things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to get as good as
they can right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel that I'm similar in that way,
but there's also just something that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much better that you gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you learn so much about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's skateboarding or photography or
whatever it is, you learn so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're doing than just the
narrow band that you would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: experience if someone said, no,
this is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just go, okay, I'll just practice
that until I get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're doing it off on your own,
you're making like mistakes that
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals like I've never heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone even fucking doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, you know, you run into new
ideas and new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've learned how to operate
the camera, I learned how to set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all this stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still looking at it from that beginner
point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have like a different eye for
where the light should go, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the subject should be turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you learn, you know, the way to
do it, it has to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light has to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your camera has to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't, there's no room for
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I'm in there now and
I've got like, you know, photo cells and a
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight and I'm like putting a streak
of orange across my picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just want to see what that looks
like, you know, swinging Christmas lights
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just want to see how it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff, I wouldn't be trying at
all if I had just stuck to the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and growing is the same way and same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing with breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there's so many different ways
to make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just, you can, you can collect
your pollinated events.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use live plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a combination of the two,
which is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about redundancies, but like,
there's so many ways to cultivate and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, there is wrong ways to
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, there's so many just
different ways to get really good results,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can choose your own path.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to love those choose your own
adventure books when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that part of life where we get to
kind of pick and choose to do things how
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd like to do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hooked on those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, you know, this is, I've grown a
lot before in the past, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: until like 2017, 2015, where I started my
own grows and doing it all on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just fucking it up left and
right and experimenting and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years I've, I've grown under
every kind of light you can grow under,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I've grown indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown every kind of medium just
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've done everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through all of that experimenting,
I've, you know, found my way that works
[SPEAKER_00]: for me and is best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it now is, you know,
my way before was, you know, full 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: organic and under, you know, CMH or HID
lights and, you know, no LED and more old
[SPEAKER_00]: school way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's how I like my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've smoked just about every strain
there is since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, is that how you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, now because of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've steered towards, I'm in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do, you know, crop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all these things where my main focus
is on making stuff that a home grower
[SPEAKER_00]: who's never grown before can knock it the
fuck out of the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I'm not just making for
a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be good enough to where a
commercial guy is going to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy crap, I'm finding so many keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want it good for everyone,
but through my selection process before I
[SPEAKER_00]: release stuff, I intentionally grow them
really, really poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I intentionally make most of the mistakes
that new home growers will make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm having temperature swings,
RH swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intentionally bringing the EC up and down,
back and forth, the pH up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to push the plants to right the
edge of dying or going full intersex on
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see which ones I should
never release.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I put something through just
absolute hell, I mean, I take plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, put them in the forest,
bring them back in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're filled with thrips and leaf
miners and everything else and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see what's the worst case
scenario with this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do that, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the Lord's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a sterile facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep this place as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't bring anything with me,
I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, I push them to the point
where I can decide about a quarter to half
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I make gets released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's through that process where I look
at a plant and go, okay, that survived and
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't herm or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's shit weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want someone to just make every
mistake possible and still end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that they look at and go,
I'm really proud of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I might be like, I don't want to
smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are really proud of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want something that's got that
survivability, that's got that resilience
[SPEAKER_00]: and can handle those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why now I'm in cocoa and
salt-based nutrients with reservoirs that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can alter on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing everything in my house,
but it's like a commercial facility shrunk
[SPEAKER_00]: down in my main testing room and growing
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can alter stuff really, really
quickly, easily, and put the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: through their paces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I know there's no point in
releasing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded really great to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeding, the real magic is in the
phenohunting and in the selection process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of stuff on paper looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in life it's that way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, so many things sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put this with this and you get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work like that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about dominant traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know the lines really
well, it's kind of a crap shoot,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have stuff where it's like,
man, I didn't even know that would
[SPEAKER_01]: express.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we have recessive traits on
both sides, now we get expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, even the stuff that I'm excited
about, I've planned out ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this cut and this cut are going
together, and that's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still only at best one in 20 of those
where it ends up like you imagined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this idea in your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Romual and I bred with it so much,
I know what to expect from her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got certain things I can breed
her with where I already know the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profile before I bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it usually comes out correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that it's going to be
worth putting out into the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As breeders, I have told my friend this,
and he's like, I want to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to be famous one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be really well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't understand what this industry
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most breeders, our work with time just
disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disappear, we die, and our work is
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has it anymore, and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few select of us that we
can't even really be part of the equation
[SPEAKER_00]: where the community says, that plant,
that cut, we want to keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you almost have no control over it as
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what hits with the people and
what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders put things out on their own,
and that helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is emotional anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like one of those things where
you do it because you love doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it out there, and the world either
accepts it or it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll embrace it in certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've bred a lot of stuff that's out there
that'll probably be out there forever that
[SPEAKER_01]: I may never get credit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not even about the credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done contract breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still devotional for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do it because I love doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to continue doing it as long
as I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just an amazing thing because
we're stewards, and we're able to take
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant from where we got it and move
it along into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just one small piece of this plant's
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very honestly feel not to be hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or spiritual or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the plant chooses us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picks people, and it's like, I'm not
letting you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I will probably never be let go of
by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some people out there that
it's part of you forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them grew up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them found it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in my diapers playing underneath it
and around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hit me around seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get high time magazines and
start reading them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be a breeder one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot about it as I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was this period when I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already had my dream career before
this all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I started really getting into
this, it was like my dream career was
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so meaningless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd built this whole company up from
the ground up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was working jobs where I'm making 20
grand plus in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go and maybe go broke,
maybe end up homeless because this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I've always wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to telling my friend,
he's got these grandiose ideas in his head
[SPEAKER_00]: of what being a breeder is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't understand that that
part of it is like your work as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's five years or a year or 50
years as a breeder, most of it just
[SPEAKER_00]: disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you can make a cut and you
give it to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the community goes, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens with some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it's not even original.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a lot of people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're thinking, well, I made this
because I crossed this with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't mean that it's
genetically that different from so many
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to make something original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to make something
completely original.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people that have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're still also working on the most
of the hard lifting and the heavy lifting
[SPEAKER_01]: was done in the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to work off the fruits of the
labor that was done back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very few of us sifting through
18 weeks sativas and spindly little things
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to get that down to something a
little more smokable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you had to have some patience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still some guys doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look up to these guys like Simon from
Serious Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like he's done the real work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made real true F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten to that point where I'm
making my own F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I'm going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my lifetime, that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goals are not lofty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very basic base level.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders are like, I want to make
this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I just want to get through
breeding stuff with a Romulan for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I've been doing for the past
eight years as a breeder is just like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else I talked about,
I've been experimenting and learning along
[SPEAKER_00]: the path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel bad for the people that got my
first crosses, even though most people
[SPEAKER_00]: love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the early stuff I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, shit, I didn't know how to test
it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't doing the right work back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did have good foundational genetics,
though, at least on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of what else you crossed,
I mean, I think that's a great starting
[SPEAKER_01]: point that a lot of people have missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are taking these complex
polyhybrids that have 50 different things
[SPEAKER_01]: in them that are genetically unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're crossing them with something
else that's completely genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: unstable that might even be related to the
thing that they're crossing it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start looking at their parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do this thing called
breeding that they think is making an
[SPEAKER_01]: outcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what they're doing is
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you take Gelato and cross it
to Sunset Sherbert, it's like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: making a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are like, oh,
I just made this new cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, that's not an F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many things out there where
people have crossed this together with
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cross siblings together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You crossed Gelato 33 and Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing the work like you think
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, even with the naming
conventions and genetics, you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone could give you Gelato 33,
but tell you that it's whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purple jagu.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hitting on one of the things that's
been stuck around and I wasn't planning on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I released my first batch of
Romulan seeds, they were regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was working off an old batch of
seeds that were like F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hunted a male and a female from that and
made regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I was like, I don't want
to touch my family's cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not worthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll try to make FEMS with it,
but I don't want to, I don't even want to
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pick a female and I'll pick a male
out from these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made reg seeds and I put them out
there and I had all these guys who've been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a long time and they're like,
it's literally the best Romulan version
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever grown ever from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, well, I didn't keep
that female around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't make more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to make a different version now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up making it with my family's
cut and the same male I had selected for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make them and I'm like, you know,
okay, well, what do I call this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I would start thinking about
the, I get some help from a friend and he
[SPEAKER_00]: goes, well, you know, you took an F4,
F5, and then an F1, they're related.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an intergenerational cross called
an IX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go and Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, if I call this an IX,
what's going to happen with the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're not even going to know what
an IX is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people like you,
but most of my customers would,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I would just be get bombarded every day
with what's an IX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the strain is Romulan BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's an IX1 and that nobody asked
me any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still laughing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've explained it thoroughly to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was open about what it was that the BX1
is just in quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Romulan BX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like nobody had any questions after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a few breeders that came to
me and they're like, why is it BX1 in
[SPEAKER_00]: quotes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, well, it's an IX1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see on the packaging,
you can see on the seed listing,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything says, you know,
intergenerational cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I just put it out on your,
just that, no one would know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time everyone was calling
everything a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was putting out these BX1s left
and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's none of them were back crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make this a little inside
joke and call this a back cross one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still, it's the people keep
asking me for more of those seeds and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck around to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to explain more what the back
cross one quotes is than I had to,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would have had to explain what an
intergenerational cross is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny cause I got an interesting
story around Romulan and shaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy had it back in the day and it
was, it should have been called the
[SPEAKER_01]: shaman, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was shaman crossed with the
Romulan back to the shaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a shaman BX1, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But he called it shaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if somebody has the real shaman out
there that we had back in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was Barney's, maybe Barney's
that had a shaman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't greenhouse, but it was a
European cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shaman I've heard of and I know about,
but I wasn't real familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the shram was something I came in
contact with, but not the shaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, if somebody out there has the
shaman, or has a shaman, I would love to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it so we can work on this shaman,
shaman project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I love the nostalgic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throwbacks were like, can we recreate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to recreate the cat piss
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like roadkill skunk
expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we didn't have roadkill
skunk as far as I knew back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some skunky, really, really skunky
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would smell a whole room up just one
little small bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody has a shaman reach out,
we got Mr. Romulan right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make some amazing crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like those kinds of projects are
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody really has it, but the
thing is, is like, just cause it's called
[SPEAKER_01]: shaman, doesn't mean it's shaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cause it's called this, doesn't mean
it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Philos was one of those ones
where there was 97 things in their galaxy
[SPEAKER_01]: that were all OG cus with different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a lot of problems out
there in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was getting into coming into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like had this whole, you know,
we're a community and from being a
[SPEAKER_00]: trafficker and picking up from farmers,
you know, I knew how people treat each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea getting into the
breeding side of it, which I had never
[SPEAKER_00]: been involved with at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of just how much fuckery there is and just
left and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People taking credit for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to give credit where credit's due.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many made a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is if I bought your seeds
and I'm made seeds with your seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you sold those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody buys my genetics and make
seats, I'm actually happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, there's guys who
bought my stuff and don't give me credit
[SPEAKER_01]: or they'll call it the cross rather than
the name that I gave it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll call it the cross and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is what I think is funny
is like guys that get butthurt when other
[SPEAKER_01]: people use their genetics to make crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you sold those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that person, if you gifted them,
that might be a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I broke into your bedroom
and stole a cup from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made money off those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole purpose of pushing the
plant forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, people get like,
it's their possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they did something special and nobody
else should be touching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you bought it, you should only
be growing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's a little pretentious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like for me, that's where it
comes back to whatever I do in my mind is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a few things that I've made that
stick around, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, I encourage people to breed
with the stuff I make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see other breeders work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is like the highest level of
honor, you know, or the highest level of
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can be as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw breeders years ago,
starting to, without involving me,
[SPEAKER_00]: buying my seeds, hunting cuts out of it,
and then breeding with that, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: giving me credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me it was like, when I first saw it
come up, I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you breed with my shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think there's like, there's this
entitlement thing with the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first tasted it, the thing is- I
can taste them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely have the GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that flavor like right in front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get this sweetness Z at the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is out of the whole group of seeds
that we hunted of this cross, this was the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones either lean too heavy
towards one or the other and not in a good
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles really fucks up the structure of
most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand it's like,
the structure is terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't want to grow skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason there's not a lot of skittles
or the reason it's so expensive if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: see it is because nobody wants to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an ugly finicky plant that doesn't
like being grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That basically flips you off the entire
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really interesting in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you breed with it, the stuff that
has the real skittly structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff that's really candy,
the stuff that's really skittly in taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: all leans to that structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to find stuff that has
better structure with that candy profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while I come across
something that is a disruptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether I bred it or somebody else bred
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff out there where it's like,
okay, this is something that the white
[SPEAKER_01]: thorn people can attach their pallet to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they're like, oh yeah, that's really
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that like white
thorn rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is huge right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it's bigger than they ever thought
it would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's one thing it's like you share
it and it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then like when everybody's talking
about it, literally everybody everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about in the United States,
but definitely in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got in kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of John's buddies, Tangled Roots,
he's in Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not far from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and met up with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, so let me guess, we're meeting
because you want to make a cross with
[SPEAKER_00]: white thorn rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, actually no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do, I want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, that's not why we're meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plan was I want to shake John's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: His story hit with my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: His is his mom and mine's my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I smoked white thorn rows and it
reminded me so much effects wise of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan that I was like, I just got to
meet this guy and shake his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm wishing the best of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really wasn't about making the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of kick myself in the ass now,
because if I had taken the time to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: finish that out back now, everyone's
blowing up and I'm sure he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing this with his phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think white thorn is really
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah, you know, I talk about my
podcast a lot going back to breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, so that's a really normal part
of my daily conversation with everybody is
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how is this making us feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being a chef, I really have
focused on flavor over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's been a flavor until like last
year, halfway through the year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really started refocusing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was that was when I first heard
you start talking about effects and you
[SPEAKER_00]: always talk to about flavors before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was like your primary focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally was flavor, flavor, flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a chef, I love flavors.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about flavor combinations,
flavor pairings and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, when it gets down to it,
like if you break this all down,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're here for the effect of this thing of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the effect is so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back to stuff like when you're
doing big, large scale phenohunts where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like 600 things, you're not able to
smoke every single last one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can give them out to enough people
to where you can get a good percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some stuff that has back
bad structure, bad smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some vomit smelling plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was really wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I saved those just so I can show them
to people like, dude, like this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get with a phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff that you don't ever want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nasty smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the funniest thing is like I had
to smoke it because it was so funky,
[SPEAKER_01]: bad smelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you got to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, you know, it's part of the research
and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how does this make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got me high, but not in a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the high was about as bad as the
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like kind of like curry vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got you where you don't get any
of the visuals, but you have all the weird
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects like of mushrooms or acid or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just skin crawling and feel terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like Instagram, social media,
like, I mean, we've both been doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: for quite a while on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with Instagram, it's like,
it's such an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's not the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think they live in this
Instagram world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's its own little world, but it's not
the real world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's always going to be
haters online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you're doing something
right, you know, when you have haters,
[SPEAKER_01]: you definitely mean something to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it used to get to me a
lot more, the haters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I just realized that
especially recently I came to the
[SPEAKER_01]: conclusion that I'm just moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people are going to hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hate on you if you're
doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hate on you doing bad,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, it's not reflective of my life
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have only recently had a, you know,
an epiphany and moved forward in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just constantly losing my shit
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I just couldn't, I couldn't go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could post and then I had to like walk
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've always been like, I'm going to
actually communicate with people and
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to comments and respond to DMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be engageable,
you know, cause a lot of breeders out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, like they've learned not to,
cause it's, it's, it's actually really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really problematic if you're actually
communicating with the Instagram crowd and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Twitter crowd, like they become your
customers in a lot of ways, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, I would, I run into a
hater or whatever, and then start trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to, I lose my cool kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would always try to, I'm just trying
to explain myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you've got the wrong idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you my, my story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm now at a point where I'm
like, I'm just going to let him do their
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters are going to hate, haters going to
ain't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized the people, the ones that got
to me the most and bothered me the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if another breeder in the industry
was like, fuck this guy over here around
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet, fuck him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's talking shit, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know who he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just respected his work until that
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized a lot of them were coming from
a point of they hadn't really done any
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had heard me say maybe one thing and
didn't know that that's changed or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they, they set their mind to it
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just now talking shit down the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, nobody, nobody really has time for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really doing the real work has time
for like that kind of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, and the funny thing is not
going to slow me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of it's motivational too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like over the years it motivates me
to be the best I can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the biggest haters pushed me
forward more than anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else when I was first getting into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the thing is, is the best way to
deal with haters is not to try to reason
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can't argue with the fool,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, you're not going to
convince most people of anything
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, yeah, sometimes
there's someone I respect in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes I, you know, I have their
phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reach out to those guys and be like,
yo, this is what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a problem with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, but none of these haters
would say shit to my face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I'm saying shit to my face
if you got a problem with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just a, you know, it's one of
those things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as you become bigger and you get
more in the spotlight, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does bother me is it's kind of
growing and increasing to some degree is
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start having people impersonate
your company, your brand, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making fake accounts and just scamming
people out of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually the dumbest stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm, I'm a fairly smart guy,
but I get not everyone is fairly smart,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I, when someone tells me they're
going to be like, you're a fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you fall for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I gotta like stop and be like,
okay, you know, it didn't happen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so shitty, but we had somebody spend
like $900 on seeds and breeding book and
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of other stuff from the website,
not from our website, but they thought
[SPEAKER_01]: they were buying it from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sent this guy money and he was
fully, it was like, these guys are so
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them where it was like,
yeah, just send me $300 for those packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like, oh dude,
I'm going to double the deal and give you
[SPEAKER_01]: more seeds and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, it was like,
oh man, it's stuck in customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta pay more for shipping and the
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up sending the guy a book and
some seeds because I just feel bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, you know, it's like,
man, it's just so shitty that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people out there creating these fake
accounts too, that are just trying to scam
[SPEAKER_01]: people with telegram and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to buy my seeds is basically
through our website, North American seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with a broccoli broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dot L U.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're just doing mostly
direct, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get our book on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it from Khalifa.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Europe, you can get it from
Khalifa from Khalifa genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my boy over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we keep it small and you know,
it's like, I'm worried about counterfeits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've changed our packaging now and it's
like people knocking off stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will knock off anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I, I actually saw someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was Chris from compound
or someone years ago that dealt with some
[SPEAKER_00]: counterfeiting of their seed packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm going to just nip that
in the bud now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used can verify labels,
but they're, you know, they're made with
[SPEAKER_00]: my logo on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're all, you can scan it and
it goes right to the, you can't fake that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't cause it, it would be a
different website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be things with it that would be
wrong, even if you went that distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that secured up years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have every pack I've got has got those
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the freebie packs have this little QR
code thing on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's bad enough that we have
people who impersonate and they use
[SPEAKER_00]: telegram, but most people out there have
learned that it's like the, I'm the Saudi
[SPEAKER_00]: Prince and email, you know, give me your
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only 500 bucks and you'll get 5
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have learned about that by
now, but not everyone has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still people that get scammed
and that's why they keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, for me, it's like people
recognize it right away that that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come to me and oh, there's
another guy faking your account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, I've got all the, I've got an
LLC and everything so I can go and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram to take it down and it takes a
little time, but totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it helps that you're accessible
to some of the guys are not accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even the brands and companies and
some of these guys don't even run their
[SPEAKER_01]: companies anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like big shout out to DNA
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys still run their company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've had countless people hit me up
that are within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll make your seeds for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe how many people I make seeds for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made seeds for over the years that,
that, you know, it's like, cause I can
[SPEAKER_01]: make them cheap enough typically to where
it makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where like, I mean, I used to
charge a buck and now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just depends on volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these guys can still run a business,
you know, with other people producing
[SPEAKER_01]: their seeds, but it's like, is it
authentic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wouldn't, I'd be losing my mind
thinking about the quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know what I do and I know no one
else is going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else is going to be underneath
almost every plant every day for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four weeks while you're making
seeds in a room to make sure there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to have that bugged out
mindset that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried under canopy lights yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have thoughts on those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Negative thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I've been looking into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send you home with under
canopy lights today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to test out your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a new electric panel,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm maxed out and I need,
I need to bump up the electric service at
[SPEAKER_00]: my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can run one per four by four or
two for four by four, but as far as seed
[SPEAKER_01]: production now, you know, on the bottom,
you get a lot of lighter seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cut those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of having to sift through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut the branches off at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a nice, you've got a really big
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the smaller version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, everything's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't thrash as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've learned over the years to
like, do it in a way where there's less
[SPEAKER_00]: work at the end of sorting the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just cut the bottom branches off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, now I won't have to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why I'm limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if one plant, I'm already
limited really heavily in space,
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I'm really happy if off of one
plant, I can get a couple hundred packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or a little bit more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's like a real good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't have to cut the branches off,
I'd probably be getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: another hundred packs or something out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and all that's for the same amount
of, well, a little bit more electricity,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your inputs, you might spend a little bit
more on inputs, maybe a little bit more on
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification, you know, electricity,
energy might be a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it still pans out to more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I think the quality is just as
good, if not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower, especially from under canopy
lighting is pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can increase the seeds,
we're doing a trial right now with under
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy versus light lift, dialing in the
PPFD from above and below, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm looking forward to, right now I'm
doing it at my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've built a room from the ground up and
built a whole building on my property to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little tiny little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope one day to just be living in a
different area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause right now I'm, where I'm at,
it's like 50 cents per kilowatt hour for
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's California for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping to, at some point get,
you know, I've got plans of moving a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, maybe a little bit into Nevada
or just someplace else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the electricity will be cheaper and
I can do some more things and not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about that as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause for me, there's, there's an equation
there where it's how much is it per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilowatt hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much do I have to in the end,
sell a seed for based on how many seeds I
[SPEAKER_00]: get off of the plants and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause right now my, you know, I sell my
seeds for as cheap as I can possibly sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them for and still make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's, I sell them to a seed bank for
50 bucks a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only a little bit of money
left there for me to make money off of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, obviously if I had more space,
I could grow more seeds and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm limited where I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I'm still at a craft level and
things are successful and I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if at any point I actually just get to
move, I can, then I can start having some
[SPEAKER_00]: more fun and experimenting, doing a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was looking at that, you know,
building a whole new room set up with all
[SPEAKER_00]: under canopy lighting and mixed lighting
up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, then my dream set up that I
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for
younger guys that are coming into the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that either want to be
cultivators or they read high times
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine or maybe I don't know if high
times magazine is still printed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if they're, if they're reading the
internet, they're reading social media and
[SPEAKER_01]: they get excited about the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your one piece of advice for them
for somebody who did it very organically
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, has, has done it for quite a
while.
Don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's, that's my first initial
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying to be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is seriously how most times,
if you caught me alone, just me and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ask me, man, I'm really excited
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do what you do or get into
something about the canvas industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's plenty of other things that
unless you need to get into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, that's where you should be with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really tough in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of stuff that it's kind
of hard to even explain to people what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to deal with, what you're
going to, what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and to me, hindsight and stuff,
it's not worth it unless you have what I
[SPEAKER_00]: have right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I can't do anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I wasn't doing this, I'd just be
homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere grown plants like gorilla grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, that's who I'd be if
I couldn't do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I would say though, is if I'm
actually giving advice and it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it, don't be afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, that's the biggest thing that
holds people back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot, in a lot of areas of life is
you're afraid of the failure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences you're going to face by
trying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what I've learned, and you've
heard us talk about this, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times, we brought it up when you
make mistakes along the way, you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you learn stuff about yourself,
not just the subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you start to realize who
you are, what your character is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your soul is, what really drives you
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing more valuable in life
than you can learn than who you really
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people never take the time to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people end up 70, 80, 60,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they've never stopped to be like,
who the fuck am I really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all this, but who am I really deep
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and making mistakes is what can open
up doors and windows to you so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: learn who you are along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so don't let the fear of the failure
keep you from doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, I bet that's what that piece
[SPEAKER_01]: would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what that would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of, you know,
if I could go back in time, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that, Oh, don't date that girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of those, but if we're just
talking to generalization, I would,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sit my, you know, 10 year old self
down and be like, stop being afraid to
[SPEAKER_00]: fail just for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're gonna, you're gonna fail at
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only every now and then you have this
rare little, it all lines up and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause no matter where you can always look
at something and find the failures in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and find the things you didn't do right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gotta let that go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the easiest way to hold yourself
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody's looking to find out more
about you, pick up your genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: where would they go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Website is www.RomulanGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got an Instagram account that's
RomulanGenetics with the number two at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Twitter is a little more complicated,
but our website, if you go to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, there's like little icons for
Twitter and X and Instagram and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take you right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Twitter account is under LRishJake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would Irish with an L.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my name Jake at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old Twitter account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how's Twitter working out for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really like, it's a lot of home
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of people that are like almost
like on an island of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people looking for
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people within that group
that are helping each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice little like segregated
community in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every social media site, there's some
violent people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, just wake up and want to
be hateful, but it's been really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've enjoyed using it like a community
rather than like trying to sell shit
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put posts up, but I go and like,
I'm commenting with people and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about other stuff and having a good time
with that and helping out growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I don't really get that as much
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's chaotic there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little censored and chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great having you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to doing some breeding
projects in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad we get to finally do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys for watching.
