[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is James Loud, and welcome to
another episode of the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, my special guest is Caesar from
NorCal Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Caesar, he is NorCalICMag at
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been posted for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been in the cannabis industry for
how long?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like all my life,
really, like that's all I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forum days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, well, this is before then,
but like I would say like I'm about to be
[SPEAKER_01]: 40, so like probably like 22 years,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen the evolution from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a multiple evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was lucky lucky to like come up with
a lot of the pioneers in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was a good friend of mine and I was
just young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like a very like, I don't know,
just enthusiastic about the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were certain people that were like
pivotable, pivotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like within like my like it's just me,
it's just weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just feel very nonchalant about
shit nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like I was very passionate about
this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like as far as like when I was
younger, I was like fucking on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, hang out with Eddie Lep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him at like, you know, like shows
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went to Instagram together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ventures is like Soma, Arion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just got I also was like very
observant as far as like how the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: has played out and what not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went had gone over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like 2005, I believe we went for the
Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, they should do this in the
States because we have I think we were
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of maybe taken off or maybe I'm
not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, you know, I'm paying 22
euros for this, like a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really just a tourism thing
because it's it was worse than like it was
[SPEAKER_01]: commercialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was commercialized stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably what's going to happen to
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I don't know, however long they
were already doing it there because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were just doing all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't even testing all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they don't have testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have really shitty growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they didn't have testing back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, they have testing
possible now, but they're also going like
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal route to they're allowing like
legal grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I heard all sorts of weird stuff like
back then the Dutch stuff was like getting
[SPEAKER_01]: like they could even say they had like a
crystalline like spray that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: spray on it to make it like look like more
shiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so you were I don't know if it
was like super shardy like glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I can't say I even seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so foreign to me at the time,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I was over there, people were
telling me about this and I was like and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I also noticed the migration rights
as far as like how we were closer to like
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa for like Durban's and like,
you know, Hindu like for like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all those regions and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a migration route was a lot
easier for them to get to like towards
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam and then they get all the way
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was more typical to be able to more
closer to the source, to be more close to
[SPEAKER_01]: the source when we were out there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see Mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have your copies of what I
see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mag the magazine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you ever have copies?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I maybe got one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forgot I was even it was I didn't
get into this magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I got the form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't have the publication to some
part of it, though, like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see was International Cannographic
magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I still have copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was just more of, you know,
just like I said, just like passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about like showcasing what we were doing
at the time, which was very like minimal
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were we had good weed back
then in the Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I of course, I think it was it was if
you're growing your own, you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were just so used to all the
commercially produced imported stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff was not domestically
produced because the laws were not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they weren't allowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't like now that it's lax,
everyone's like, oh, just throw some out
[SPEAKER_01]: there like, you know, 50 pounds in a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I guess nowadays is the way that
the prices have plummeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back then you could like you could
make I remember, I mean, paying close to
[SPEAKER_01]: like five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember getting I got I got five
thousand for for outdoor for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I mean, this is just whatever regular
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, really, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was it was literally I remember
there was times when there was it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: drought like you couldn't people don't
there was no droughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like there was no work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like so it's like, you know,
either you have to adjust this this
[SPEAKER_01]: transitionary period where like the prices
are going to adjust just like nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like no one's getting work.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone kind of slowly started
going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, I don't know, when I was like
hustling and stuff, I was on the like a
[SPEAKER_01]: basically like first person that I knew of
that was doing like four dollar rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then but then it was like no breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was looking like three twenty is
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it was like, all right,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and if people were hell mad to be
like all the local hustlers, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was taking all the business,
you know, whatever it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about Dose Doe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know the Dose Doe was your
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought it was from archive for
the longest time to make it into the
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you did you did some phenol hunting
with it like that's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically it was just an agreement
where we were just supposed to like split
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he gave me the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did my mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do marketing or anything at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just we were documenting already
the form and the animal on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like when I got the OJKB,
I was just told it was cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this plant doesn't look
the same because the form and animal were
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The form was probably a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all just speculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, you know, you can't quote me on
this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get all the bagsies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was because the animal is
always more tightly held and like it was
[SPEAKER_03]: known as a more animal cookies from
Sirius.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, well, I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what happened with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I know is it's animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, seriously, my homie, like a piece
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just saying, like, you know,
he you know, he was definitely known for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but as far as I know,
they were, you know, when it first hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene, everyone was like tripping because
it was like kind of the the new coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from OG Kush, like as far as like the next
thing that supposedly like the next Holy
[SPEAKER_01]: Grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually still is like,
you know, to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, but who's growing it these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ironically, everyone's asking for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So totally people like not still,
but yeah, because everything's cyclical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like it's fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trendy, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now everyone wants the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the original Girl Scuggies is a
bag seed anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's into this Durban poison and
shit like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, see, well, you never spoke Durban
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so I smoke real.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we smoke real Durban and it had a nice
the Durban like I have some Durban here
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we were going to smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a nice at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that shit's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so this is Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Durban that I remember was like
straight and nice and musk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a little hazy, but it wasn't
like this kind of haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas this is more like the people,
the haze flavors that they know that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little bit of fruit in there,
but like, and it's softer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, because I couldn't tell you
what I remembered as like some certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things are very nostalgic to me,
but that one, I remember smoking on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really wasn't a big deal back then,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just because we were there and it
happened to be something that was an
[SPEAKER_01]: offering from Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So check this out and tell me what you
think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do a little bit of
comparative tasting today or comparative
[SPEAKER_03]: smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of how I do palette training.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do like and haze is a great example
because there's a turpinoline limonene
[SPEAKER_03]: that's so dominant with the haze
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a softer, you know,
that's that's got a nice soft smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got some super silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have super silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got some from Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the next one we got is some Jack
Ferrer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this Jack is real interesting,
but but different than the Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, oh, you got some sour Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the actual Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't even tell you this is like
the real Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just fire in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could see it definitely being as far
as Durban, as you tell me, because I just
[SPEAKER_01]: smelled this and I told you to make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: See.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is much more Durban smelling than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they still both have a nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Jackie, that haze, that Colombian
undertone.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: These these kind of stink.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so now the funny thing is,
is like with comparative tasting or
[SPEAKER_03]: comparative smelling, like what we're
doing, you tell us a super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this one is by far.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, from Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was buying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like a lot of people think these
smell exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you have them all side by side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you smell them and then you go back and
smell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you really notice the differences
between them because the turpinoline and
[SPEAKER_03]: limonene and some of those other terpenes
really cancel each other out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go from that to smell that
right away without smelling the coffee,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll notice that smells different
because the the strong haze nose cancels
[SPEAKER_03]: it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now all of a sudden you get these like
it's it's like a little bit of fruit I get
[SPEAKER_03]: on there and maybe some earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's interesting when you compare
because people think haze is all smell the
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some stronger than you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have seen enough to actually
know the subtle variances.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, it's just kind of
like like for me, I mean, runs like I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not into all the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I really haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it when people come to my crib or
something that usually they go to the club
[SPEAKER_01]: and spend money on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't mean that'll be like this is
this runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this runs in like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are all very similar runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember if they only white or
black.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many renames.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut fishing and the renaming shit is just
it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's prevalent prevalent a lot
with the the East Coast brands and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like you all know where the
where the muscle strains came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's very few that are
actually going to be able to tell you that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to tell you where to buy it
and how it's the best that you've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, whatever, you know,
you never seen anything better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're you know, they can't tell you
about the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a while, they were renaming Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like it was all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to the East Coast was getting
like it was just typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like I knew Bubba's like I was like
I could see because there's so much is
[SPEAKER_01]: going out there that like they were going
to start calling it cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually I'm surprised that they
were able to do it because I had heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: people doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, that's just Bubba
because I had seen some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and yeah, like I don't know what the
like, yeah, I don't even know how the fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: people are still messing with Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I like the pre-98 Bubba
because it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real Bubba because that you smoke it
down to the roach and it still has that
[SPEAKER_03]: gassy soapy taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, those are the stuff that we had back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see people producing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen a real Bubba on that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who kept the plant alive that long?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's that that one's probably not
many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't say nobody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But and it got replaced with the other
publicist that everybody knows today is
[SPEAKER_03]: publicist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as good that finishes in like 50
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, because back then it was 42
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much like everything was six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, yeah, we were on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, you know, money making
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those flower rooms are 24, 24 hours,
12 hours a day on 12 hours off all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, six, five days a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and then you just keep the bedroom
stocked and just keep the flower room
[SPEAKER_01]: stocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like mono, we went through mono
cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, see a green like all you'll think
like S.A.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: is screen of green when it's a sea of
green, which is like a completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people refer to it as like
the trellis netting and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green is like, no, we used to take four by
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was ebb and flow back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was easy because it was like,
you know, to be there all the time because
[SPEAKER_01]: we were just there's too much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea of Green, the real sea of green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people think the Scrog is sea of
green when it's actually sea of green.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had ebb and flow and that was a whole
different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to do the four by four is like
I think it's 64 per four by four or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the four by four rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a lot of people don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, like and it's just it's
just like you could flip it whenever you
[SPEAKER_01]: want before you like while you're trying
to clone it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow in Rockwell or did you grow lava
rock?
[SPEAKER_03]: What what did you do back in the day with
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I kind of like the right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was I was watering soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I could I'm going to probably
set up irrigation system like later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't mind, you know, I always
thought soil tasted the best as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: soils, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's my personal stuff,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I mean, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it's like, fuck,
like it's the Rockwell for me is just more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a it's more easier to dial in on a
commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm very like familiar with it on
that scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the home tip is definitely always
like, I don't know, this is more for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself anyways, you know, for my homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been breeding for a long time or
working with pollen, working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I mean, that's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, I always looking for
something better and like all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, there's I'm never
complacent with like mediocrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but like I'm always looking for
something better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just kind of came along as a
natural progression between like at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point you had a point where you're not
really getting you might be getting like I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember I was getting really good weed
that I was spending money at the club,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one time, like I said,
there's certain people within your life
[SPEAKER_01]: that like are kind of pivotal in like in
motivating you into like going in a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just a young kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around here in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember there was like Planet Earth
was on Castro and they had then they had
[SPEAKER_01]: the warehouse on Dorman, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was West Coast Growers,
this guy from like Mendocino who came down
[SPEAKER_01]: and I walked in that room and it was like
it was all automated, like everything like
[SPEAKER_01]: he was had like lights on like the turners
and like they would go like looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything was on drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fully automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had like it was the first time that
and he was selling these the tray stands
[SPEAKER_01]: with like this is like 20 years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just shit that like to this day is
still actually like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not really that just kind of catching on
maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that far off from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we just used to use that little
Asian that likes like, I guess stools or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like just flip them upside down or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still the tray on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to make wood benches like we did
wood for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not the most sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was just a lot of work and it
was just like when you're shutting down
[SPEAKER_01]: the spots and moving that you don't want
to have taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to do a spot where we had to
take apart the wood tables and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But destroy like it was like a demo team
that had to come to you to take that shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have to throw away all that
wood, which supposedly would at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually really expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have rolling tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so O.G.K.B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that your first big that was your
first big cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it's mainly just.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I remember attached to the
notoriety with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I mean, it's it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those ones that has a really
mutated kind of look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it smokes amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good breeder, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it was back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just documenting the form of the
animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like O.G.K.B.
[SPEAKER_01]: and O.G.K.B.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are like they don't know
what it even means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kuschbrecht is like like an ode to like
the his his handle because he's my homie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can't I got the cuts from him and
he had told me they were cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, how was his cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: They like what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have cookies right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's he actually O.G.K.B.
[SPEAKER_01]: like knows like Cookie Fam and all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He you know, we used to we used to run
like the center and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all know each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, came into my possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys at Cookie Fam were all like,
I don't know, they raised some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like flag to them or some shit because
they were bugging me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, and then just kind of turn into
like this whole shit show that was like
[SPEAKER_01]: really like I just had nothing to do with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was really it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kuschbrecht.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people don't even know that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just my it was just like
literally just a way to differentiate the
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was nothing like cool about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, we're going to make the next
cool strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just name it just like I had a
plate that had an animal form and O.G.K.B.
[SPEAKER_01]: when I finished it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also tell the plant because of
the fact that, you know, the plant grew
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and Justin, he got that plant
and it was pretty, pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he got a lot of pathogens when I you
can ask him about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really talked about it,
but like, yeah, I mean, it was definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: it was still doing all right in my
possession, but I definitely wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: have it backed up as soon as I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just getting it was getting
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I had gotten it originally,
it was rise to this day, like one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst plants I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, it was screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like I flowered some of it out
because I had to like bring some flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants from my place and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it was, you know, just I just it
doesn't very it doesn't throw many like it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't take Paul very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of like non viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's a learning curve to
I've never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not going to look that far into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, there's some shitty versions
of it where people grow it out and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell it's the right genetic, but it just
doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like kind of shreds in a bag
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I said, at the end of the
day, it's all a grower, dude, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like for sure, like, you know,
power says back in the days you say you
[SPEAKER_01]: never know the flower, the power until you
flower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then we I harvested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We figured out that it was like all the
guys that were running the cookies to they
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, oh, shit, like this is cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like something else, but it's
cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like unmistakably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just kind of took off from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really gave it to nobody just
because not because I was trying to hoard
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually gave it to homies that helped
me out, like even just like moving things
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: People didn't give stuff out as much back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just never.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never close.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's rightfully so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you let something out,
it's going to be out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like don't get mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if someone gives me a clown and
they're like, oh, well, you weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, then don't give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't want to have to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got workers at my crib or something,
or, you know, like that old, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my homies, like they know whatever
they.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just grab some cuts,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we try to hold stuff close still.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and now it's a little
different now because everything's like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's things are worth a lot more money
and there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start writing contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even the contracts are not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not 100 percent, but at least
with contracts and for all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like you got to have the money for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're really going against a big
dog, like a big company, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so but now there's a lot more
value within like the intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property that you possess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants are just like a very like
grayish area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so sure things get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everyone always someone's
helping somebody and then something gets
[SPEAKER_01]: out and then everyone starts hoarding it
or like, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or someone finds a seed in it and that's
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's happened quite a bit over
the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the seeds are better than the
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, like it's like, you know,
I get people all the time to like about
[SPEAKER_01]: like OGKB or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, you know, like they'll send
me pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I can't tell you like this mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't get it from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying you had to have gotten
it from me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't tell you out of a picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't validate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to be like, oh,
like so and so said, it's like it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: his cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, whoa, dude, I didn't say
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always tell people same shit like
Instagram doesn't tell the whole story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, never for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to show you what they wanted
to want to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of stuff looks good on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes the first hit tastes good or
sometimes it doesn't taste good at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of stuff looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like I said, like all this,
like, like, you know, all this new stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: call like Jarl and smelling weird,
you know, because it's like when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like back in the day is hustling and stuff
coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the pad that's the shipments coming
in and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'd be the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'd be the fucking bland shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there would be some shit was just full
of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no idea what the hell that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crystals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you didn't like that's,
you know, and then fucking people that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know they weren't really telling
you they were trying to get rid of their
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jerry Cusack, he was saying he's been
smoking powdery mildew since he was four
[SPEAKER_03]: years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, bro, like you're eating fucking
vegetables of DDT lace, like in the 90s
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit, you know, like they like,
you know, people don't understand what how
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the plant is and how how you
actually can manipulate it and how far it
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually go and how far it has yet to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once the other rules, factors come
into play, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got some flour to show us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's a bunch of stuff we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is a dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from Chris at Flora Flam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Moonbow is one of my
favorites, like when done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it like a couple of times and I
don't I never actually got it from
[SPEAKER_01]: Fletcher himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but like whatever I did see was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it ain't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes from reputable people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, I trust their judgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's really that goes a long
ways to me, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it has the frost of dosi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get like it's not just it's
not like diet skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smoke it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roaches still taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a bunch of different phenols
that are all pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think a lot of it, like I said,
from like like modern day, like whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: we know, nutrients have a lot to do with
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So and like growers, you know,
so like you can see the genetic potential
[SPEAKER_01]: in a plant if you grow really well once.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, you know, you might have if
it's really good, you know, I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what cookies actually kind of
revolutionized stuff in a sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was able to like bring along
that brand name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was came at a time where weed
wasn't getting that much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually everyone was starting to
pay for seeded packs again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it carried on that thing is it
definitely had that that bag appeal,
[SPEAKER_01]: like and it was it did have a different
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting turbine profile, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, and then there's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So flora flame, I feel like it just keeps
getting better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's supposed to get better as more
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best run was eight like back in the
days we used to toss everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would never dream of some shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really it's like farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you fucking farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like it's it's it's a little
more, you know, labor intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cure on this stuff is so nice,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got a refrigerated fucking
fully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's keeping it below six.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing everything right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else you got over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The poison gushers, some Jeff fuel gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'm a big fan of that poison
gushers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, honestly, like I get a I've had a
lot of that in the Sherbert room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, like, I like them either
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But poison gushers is my go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets you high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you really high, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it checks the boxes for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some fritter.
[SPEAKER_02]: These two right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are interesting because these are
my homie, Nas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sure he does fucking good work,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been holding that shit for like two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty five is he was probably he got in
on it kind of early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the twenty three.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a thirty three, which is thirty
three in the forty were my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the forty five was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like super purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all like not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nothing like for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be something like is that they
got blown out like like there's certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things that did like game changer shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I see it and I'm like, wow,
like I like that a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would almost make this a staple on
a menu that stuff to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Apple fritter is like one of my least
favorite genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, is like it smells so
good and it smells like apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get this apple pie smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, is when I go to smoke
it, you don't get that apple taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one thing I don't like
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks good, but it's not my choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of the apples and
bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this stuff was was grown back
immaculately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, a lot of this stuff is just
like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it all comes down to basically
who whoever grew up as you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like it's I'm a huge fan of apples
and bananas, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to get at is like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not super appley either.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like GDP kind of knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it reminds me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somewhere between the Albu and GDP,
that's kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just felt like I was probably closer
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was I used to grow that stuff
and it was like kind of big, super sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That aoda all the above.
[SPEAKER_03]: That shit was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's like early to mid 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the aoda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think so that after was sweet
and it yielded and it was super,
[SPEAKER_03]: super, super frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's when I saw the apples and
bananas, I feel like that terpene profile
[SPEAKER_01]: came through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's it's I've been looking
to get that real after you back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the after that we have is different
here than it is over overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know originally it was big,
humble staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I got from originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a shepherd's meadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does super great work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a farmer or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, he that's kind of how I got into
a lot of this stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was on the first few that was
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: To that, you know, it won a cup in like
2006, not a high times one, but one up in
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's this is a glitter bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Stens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit about the glitter
bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it was basically, I mean,
I just approach everything the way I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like like I had done some outdoor
runs with GKB and then I pollinated them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still have a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd see that I still got to sort
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones, though, I got down to like
there wasn't that many of those GKBs in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of non viable seeds,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that to a blueberry headband that
I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I grew those out and I gave Chris
the female that I selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris from Compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, I just went over there and
then just I was like, yeah, let's fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: make something happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cross to one of your males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I didn't know if they were,
you know, I didn't foresee like them
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it like, you know, as far as
marketing it the way they wanted to market
[SPEAKER_01]: it, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they did a really hell of a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like eye candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got it's got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely photogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if it wasn't, I'd be like,
I mean, I'll be the first one to tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's got unique chirps, too,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stands out in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but my only complaint is you
take one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first hits taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But down at the Roach on the refire,
it doesn't taste quite as good as some
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But initially, the flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's and that could be grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always default that because that's kind
of what we've always been told,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and everyone else wants to spout
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is like, I've seen a lot
of good stuff through Athena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's nothing there's no reason to
lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I've seen I've tasted good
weed from pretty much probably every
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never had a complaint.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember, like, good weed better than I
remember bad weed that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: When stuff is memorable, it's just like,
you know, when it's bad, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, shit, like I'm not going to know
names, but I got to like I met these
[SPEAKER_01]: dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a really flashy booth and all
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like a touch screen and all this
stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, yeah, we got these
three roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like, you know, he's like,
yeah, you take some.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, you know, smoking on the way
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, it was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to complain much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you got a good if you're going
to do a pre-roll, you got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got I mean, any more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want an amazing pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whether it's to show your brand
off that you're just giving away or
[SPEAKER_03]: whether you're selling them, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me you have to do like the whole
giveaway shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't just give you my shit
if I really want you to have it like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't want no cheap shit with
my name on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want whatever you're going to get is
going to look nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that that may have worked in the
beginning of rec or medical in 2012 where
[SPEAKER_03]: you could give stuff away and people were
happy, but people are not going to come
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I feel bad because I like as a
person that pays for this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't ask for prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it done the way I want it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, unfortunately, that if people
want to buy it, that's on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be quality and it's not
going to be you're going to get like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're going to you should be
happy with what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think with clothing,
it's easier to it's kind of easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: convince somebody that it's good than it's
more subjective with clothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, then then actually then then we too,
though, we can be we can be subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be everything is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we all have different palates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what one person likes, you know,
I wouldn't say everybody's going to like
[SPEAKER_03]: cat piss if you give them some cat piss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like cat piss, but and I'm sure I'll
still try it here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I'm not I wouldn't go by
like a pound to smoke it to the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silver Haze, like I probably would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd have homies that I smoked a
bunch of that super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've probably got a good amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, boom, this is like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything I like about Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We and then like Soma, like we he had like
a lot of people get like they had NYC
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did Soma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the great for you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people still think that's like a
diesel type of like it's not diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so far from diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it totally frustrates me,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you don't know that,
you know, like when you start growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I bred that into the sage and sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that's like that was from DNA or
who was that was from TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like one of the first shops in
Amsterdam, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they were the first for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I remember that's exactly
right around the time they had moved out
[SPEAKER_01]: to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right when I had gone out there,
710, Adam and I are doing a drop sage,
[SPEAKER_03]: more sage against the machine crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We I did the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam's promoting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing the packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's putting his beautiful touches on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the sage like sage and sour is
definitely very it's it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my homie had I have another homie
that when I was young, he had brought some
[SPEAKER_01]: weed down here from college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, damn, this is fucking I
was like, this is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, girl, I didn't get rid of like
10 pounds is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then, I was a little bit like that
was the best dispensary weed that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've ever bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to go back and buy these guys
in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe used to sell it to Harborside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the sour structure as this
very like the way the calyx stack is kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like sour, but it's more like Williams
Wonder, one of those ones that's really
[SPEAKER_03]: podgely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the calyx.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the way they stack is very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that stuff smokes so good,
though, but it's smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sour, like the Fino, I like smoked a
lot like sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a sweet, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's very blend between both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a sage, like I like it,
but when it's burning, it's a little too
[SPEAKER_01]: offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like kind of getting the whiff of it
when I pass by.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sitting there because I'll be at
my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: My homie left some of the house and I'm
like, why do you smell this shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, and I was like,
it's not lit that I could smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was right there in my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but the sour, I love sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do like I would do it for myself
all day, 10, 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, really, I'm just going to
put out whatever I like and like you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: choose what you like and if you don't,
then fuck, I need to find a new career.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to grow a bunch of sour,
11, 12 weeks every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never let it just go 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like 10 is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like you really got to let it go at
least 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like the best was 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in the days, yes, because you
could actually let your shit go for three
[SPEAKER_01]: months and to get good money for it
regardless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of times I'd only go one
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd want it to all finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's not like I'd have half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, no, we were monocropping for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like there was certain like
Legends, Ultimate Indica, L.U.I.
[SPEAKER_01]: like that was like a super monocrop,
like straight yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like I said, we were throwing
roaded cuts straight into four by four
[SPEAKER_01]: rock walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw them into like into the like get
them all ready for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw them for like two days in there and
then flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then by, you know, you'll start
seeing roots like they'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll end up with short, stocky plants,
but you're you're going to end up with no
[SPEAKER_01]: larf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all like fucking tola bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Champion nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Champion nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, that's my like everything with
my cultivation is like tops are all
[SPEAKER_01]: champion nugs if you want to pay for
something in a jar, you know, which I do
[SPEAKER_01]: like I like it, you know, and it's like
this is like champion nugs shit right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, everything else just gets like
processed within the best means possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the day,
I'm learning like, yeah, it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty competitive out there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I'm not really
trying to leave nobody else, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not trying to say I'm better than
anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but it's better just compete with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm I'm at biggest credit,
you know, and I don't take offense to
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people give me a ball, like,
you know, and it's like, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, like it ain't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I respect that.
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't like fucking avocados.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I like guacamole, but I don't
like avocados.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was like, yeah, everyone loves
avocados.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently they got avocado toast and shit
everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, avocados.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the most popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Popular fruits in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, but that's like more new,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I like avocados.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Avocados are good on every.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm a big fan of eating avocados
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just get, you know, but also,
I mean, your taste change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got at least like onions when I was
younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that's that seems weird,
but it's really good, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just might do the green tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I think if you like green tea
or ice cream or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green tea ice cream is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mochi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have like, here's like, we got the
clothing and stuff going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like how it comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a black compostable bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a lot of your merch stuff that
you're launching soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I figured I'd bring it by,
show it off real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got our little ball or these clone
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you buy clones from us,
they'll be coming with a individually
[SPEAKER_01]: tested certificate of authenticity or not
of, you know, basically of this path and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pest and pathogen free, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you will also be getting this for
like snips.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring them in these rose vials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ship snips and all you people,
you guys go ahead and buy it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first time I've seen a snip
shipper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, a lot of people use the clone
shippers and wrap them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best way to is in a gallon baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's if you're sending multiples,
like for singles, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gallon baggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: No paper towel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just throw a bunch of these
together and send it off like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Polyethylene bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like polyethylene bags with almost no
air in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can even put them in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't understand those
slips are pretty durable.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like on the cusp of like
everything kind of going a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, me getting involved and whatnot,
I guess, in whatever I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some stuff called the Juicy Fruit
that came down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure where it came from,
actually, now at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it came to the Bay and we got it and
it tasted it was like Skittles on the
[SPEAKER_03]: level of the sweetness of the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was like Juicy Fruit bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted just like it was Juicy Fruit and
it tasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started noticing everything
started getting called the Juicy Fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a bunch of fake Juicy
Fruit that's gone around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't I didn't know at the time,
like, you know, like it was renamed Golden
[SPEAKER_01]: Goat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize weed was a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it ain't like my mom caught me
growing weed in her in her closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was like she's wondering what the
hell that light was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and she's like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, it's just plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like and like she's like,
oh, is that a weed or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, but that's not weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's and that was probably a little
bit after I figured out that it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like she was like, oh,
wow, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, but she never smelled weed
in her life or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: She really didn't like it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: She does not want this for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she started with one light or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started going into that store at West
Coast Groves and I was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get home and my house was my chick at
the time and I tore everything out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: out of my closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like a cool like I like three by
five, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did two sixes in there and I like
drilled the holes in the and I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to operate tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so young and I was like banging
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the one in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost trying to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: My girl was like all the clothes is
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a portable air conditioner
in there that didn't last too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, obviously my cable bill
jumped up crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They you know, you don't think about these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to remedy these problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's creating heat as a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the room was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was, you know, like it's yeah,
it's like I said, I've tried everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's I've wasted a lot of money doing
it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to buy like I used to be that
person buying 30 bottles of different like
[SPEAKER_01]: now things are I feel like are more
simplified.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much more simplified.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to we didn't have like,
you know, like do certain things for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to like figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always got my best results from when it
was the least amount of stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't need.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to be turning your
lights on and off every day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of timers back then, they
wouldn't even handle the amperage of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a 1000 wall light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like it's yeah, they made
them better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like there's other things that,
you know, controlling your CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running that closet with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized I had to do a closed
loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was running the air through the
lights of two 600s and then going back up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be pumping it full of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I was running bio
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't really doesn't hold well
in reservoirs at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the newer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how long has it been since you used
bio?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've changed their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using the bio heaven,
I believe, when I kind of started veering
[SPEAKER_01]: away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went on a cutting edge and then
I like cutting edge still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like cutting edge because they're
local and I like, you know, they're cool
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't like I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, needing moving barrels of
nutrients is not, you know, you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: forklift for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I'd rather have a lot of
powder and, you know, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better for the earth for one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better for your back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better for the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and and there's interesting
products that aren't made with salts
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a if you're going to go that
route, if you're not going living soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like there's like I couldn't say I was
disappointed in anything, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was, it was because it didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm doing seed production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using cocoa and I'm using salts
typically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I experiment with a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like cocoa a lot, you know,
like, but like I just don't like using
[SPEAKER_01]: like the dirt that I got was from bio 365.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a pretty good job about like what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy with their dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would use that here, but I can't do it
because it's not sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you can get bugs
potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because most dirt is sterile
cocoa, sterile cocoa and rockwell.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do rockwell mostly sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, back then, like, I mean, we didn't
even we were just doing royal gold
[SPEAKER_01]: defaulting and we were putting our bags in
like black contract bags and loading them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like when powder came
into play, I was like, you could just do
[SPEAKER_01]: this instead of carry a six gallon,
you know, like a three part nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it's like 50 pounds a
piece.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's a lot, a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, it's like I said,
I've tried to like house and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I all sorts of stuff and three part the
house and garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, three part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original is always Lucas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I mean, it was there was an
original three part, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like most people, if you knew that,
you know that you didn't have to buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like you just get by on the
micro and the bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and I mean, I still have people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so we used to use Jax, like,
you know, out of Home Depot and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jax was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the blue stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, that's like a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they still make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have it in agriculture houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it in like a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I kind of really want to do
these blind taste tests where I would
[SPEAKER_01]: purposely use that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, there's no names attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a completely blind, like,
and it's just a hangout, like all we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a hangout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone will be chilling, smoking,
whatever, comparing notes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe have a questionnaire with each one,
like checks and boxes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they all get thrown in and then
the results get calculated by a computer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, by the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you don't like it, then you're a
minority.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the thing is I never get
got like there was there's always some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a clandestine like like sort of
like, I don't know, like they was just it
[SPEAKER_01]: was always like very like held.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was always events that I feel like
were held out of like out of the public,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like and I just want to keep
everything like everyone shows up with
[SPEAKER_01]: their harvest, like freshly cured,
you know, growing all my strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can compare notes on who's growing
what.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all kind of help each other grow
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, so I'm just looking
for like a venue at the moment and get
[SPEAKER_01]: started on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like a lounge, you know,
really like ultimately like I,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't really go out much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I smoke a lot of weed now,
like a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just I'm not less smoke more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't drink at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you stop drinking, you realize how
much it costs and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: damn, like how much money you can save.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my meals are like less than half off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before it was like, oh, I'm waiting at
the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was a drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's like soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have a drink, you know, but like it
just adds up and like really, it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: good look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm still trying not to drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't drink a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drink now and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like even fly everything in my first
class and they offer you a free drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, it's your drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's like that was a problem,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I was on planes so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would be in, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was and you can be smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but either way, I'm looking at venues
currently and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, we're going for things
like taking it slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to find the right place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you'll get a lounge in San
Francisco or Bay Area?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's where I'm at, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's not cheap, though,
but it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't plan on making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all you're asking like like about
like, oh, how are you going to make money?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't think about throwing
anything to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I might bring stuff and like,
you know, it's a cool place to like
[SPEAKER_01]: showcase things, but I'm not really a
salesman like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if I see things and I want them,
I'll get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they catch my.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, you know, all people like
what they're what they're grabbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know, I appreciate the
support always.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, yeah, like, I mean, it's it's
like if I could break even at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the month, you know, and like by throwing
the like having a Friday, Saturday,
[SPEAKER_01]: going and chilling there at night to bring
my dogs, maybe, you know, like breaking
[SPEAKER_03]: even is tough because if you end up losing
a bad month, then it's like I lose all the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking goddamn time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost more money than I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like I just this
point, I just do what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, things kind of you do good
work and you do work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people threw in the towel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even see that as a reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I didn't make any money off of
weed, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, I I like I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see me taking on another career
where I would literally go into like
[SPEAKER_01]: reading every I've never read a book in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably before I stuck by school,
never reading a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's doing like Goosebumps or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I read every publication
out on this, you know, Horace Cervantes,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the weed books, but nobody even knew
it was Robert Connell Clark, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because Horace Cervantes was Robert
Connell Clark.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Connell Clark is Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a there's because it was an alter
ego.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's Jim.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Mel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that really Jim?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to make stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those guys in Ed, you know,
they put out the grow books back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were those were all great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think some of the stuff is
outdated, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I mean, that's the
beginning of an industry, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in its infancy stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the stuff still holds true.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is really nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm still working on my reading
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're hoping that it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one I think came out the Greg
Green's Breeders Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a reading book that's that's full on
reading everything about breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you know, we got a lot of pictures
that are going in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our photographers really dialed in to
building the facility at the same time is
[SPEAKER_03]: really helpful when you're writing a book
because you can do step by step and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually show the parts, the cutting
clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can show that you can show germinating
seeds and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm I'm very big on like taking
pictures as things are progressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can kind of go back and pick
whether you even want to put it up or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And showing your work isn't a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like showing your work,
showing that you're actually doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, you're doing the work,
you're doing the phenol.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people can talk about it all
day, but show your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like an honestly like I like
I'm not like you said about the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder question, like I wouldn't consider
myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I look for better and I do what a
typical breeder would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't really spend too much time
like making lines and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of visit things and if they
work and I like it, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, I'd actually rather spread it
out and get it to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I said, like with my weed,
like I have, you know, my homies come
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what they got to say about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it's like I don't want to
smell it all in my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're looking for winners and you're
popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that's why I buy this,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I want to know what you think
about these winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are like, oh, this kind of
smells black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, but it's good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the hardest part about
breeding is actually finding the winners.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, at the end of the day,
that's the real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see a lot of losers like,
you know, more losers than I see winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like that's the one thing I'll post
about room failures like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like pests, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final product like, you know, like it's
like it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's it's it's it's it's very
subjective as far as like what to what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's keepers and winners and then
there's complete like that aren't going to
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, it depends on what you're
looking for, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes in a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing that's so subjective,
because there's a lot of times I pop a 10
[SPEAKER_03]: pack and not find anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can follow the keeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not going to be something that
I've been looking to run a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like Fletcher's old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't ran any of his new stuff,
really, because I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely some I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more of like, yeah, you know,
I have to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I've been busy doing other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm up in Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Archive grows amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they send me a couple of some seeds,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, it's also like I'm dealing with
some stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, where I need it,
like pretty much I'm not going to crack
[SPEAKER_01]: those until I got a clean space to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like usually my place, I like do a lot
of my projects experience and I bullshit a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot like, you know, just to see how things
work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really will probably kind of know
how it works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, still like experimenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I love doing things like I remember
we used to grow in like laptop cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, like, you know,
like, yeah, like, you know, like I like
[SPEAKER_01]: the micro aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done the big and done really dope
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, it's cool, but it's a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, honestly, like, I don't it's
just it's so complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You deal with a lot of people,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, man, I really appreciate you coming
on today, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a pleasure talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to do this again sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you let me know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can people get a hold of you if
they're looking to get some seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, clones, all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so norcalgenetics.com, www
.norcalgenetics.com, which obviously gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me that that domain name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on Instagram, your norcal
underscore ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I try to keep everything the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be changing names and all
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go, if you don't see my brand no
more, then it's still seeing my weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be somewhere, you know,
like cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got clones out there in the
red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got I got a good like I'm
waiting to on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, we're we're the website is
not up yet, but we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, you know, once everything is
ready and good to go, then it'll go up and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be ready to roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people can DM you at Instagram or do
you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm always, you know, welcome to
talk about strains, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, yeah, I love talking about
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's one thing you put in a room
and I'll talk for year off all day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like and I'm always willing to
learn more, you know, or like see what
[SPEAKER_01]: other people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's one of those things that I
really am not that like so many opinions
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, there are so many opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, and it's like really if
something like I don't like it and like I
[SPEAKER_01]: like people do like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know why, you know, and like at
the end of the day, it's not like really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, you know, but sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the Skittles, like,
you know, take a look at it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll smoke some skittles for sure,
man.
