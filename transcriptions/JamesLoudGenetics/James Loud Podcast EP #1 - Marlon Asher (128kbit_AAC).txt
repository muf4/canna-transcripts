[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is James Loud and this is The
James Loud Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to my first episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my good friend and special guest,
Mr. Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my pleasure to be here on this
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people, it's been so long that
my friend, Mr. James Loud, has been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this and I'm so glad to be here
today, actually here with you today
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about stuff that we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been an adventure getting this
podcast set up and getting this dialed in
[SPEAKER_02]: and you've been a big part of this helping
me out, helping the crew out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really appreciate everything
you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's been a journey and I,
you know, it's motivated me a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the way I do things because I
saw your drive and what you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, I can finally say in my mind
that, you know, James is at his place of
[SPEAKER_00]: peace, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a nice spot to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon and I go way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met at a High Times Cannabis Cup in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I won the first cup, you were my
first cup in the hybrid category in 2012,
[SPEAKER_02]: so 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was partaking as a, I was actually
a celebrity judge at the cup at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I was performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had the best time of my life
after I met James because James had that
[SPEAKER_00]: good, good smoke that I was looking,
searching the place for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all about OG back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was all about OG, sour diesel,
the gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all kind of, you know,
cookies was coming on the scene and I like
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies was great, but those classic gas
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG spliff, that was it for us,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bonded because we were both,
you know, actually lovers of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That OG Kush from way back, that strain
that I don't think we can get it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't yield that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's farmers in California,
everywhere, farmers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like growing it because it
doesn't yield as much as some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the OG can yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to grow some OG back in
the days, you know, and I had a few rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got a few pounds out of it,
me and my good friend Judah back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we had a good run from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the most, you know,
requested strain back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of what made me kind of
fall in love with the strain OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the exotic of its day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you had the OG back in the day,
you had the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the variety everybody wanted,
you know, like that nobody could get
[SPEAKER_02]: because there was only a handful of people
with it and nobody wanted to share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason why we bonded so
much in Amsterdam because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was kind of an awakening of aroma when
we smell that OG coming through the crowd,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must say thanks for, you know,
having it back then because.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was great over in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over in Europe to have OG Kush was a rare
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I would have been on a panic streak
because I had, there was so much sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe how much you guys smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the crazy part.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of weed you guys smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys, you guys smoked hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I grew up, I would say go in and
buy weed for the elderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go run into the.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to sit and smoke the weed before
I take it back to them and make sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a fair understanding of what,
you know, the good stuff is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've experienced cannabis for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've seen the evolution of it and how
it's changed into the rec market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit about my show.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're doing is a blind tasting on
each episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have three different products that
are from the California rec market,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to sample each one in a
blind fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have one that's a five dollar gram,
one that's around 10 and then one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: more than 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the premium exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're doing a blind tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see how these different
products are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm going to get some feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Marlon and we're going to see how his
palette works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me say before we go forward that
sometime the five dollar gram can have
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste that people, you know,
really hold on to other than the 80 dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, sometimes, man, you said the
words.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can go both ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen some stuff that's really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: This trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen some really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so this should this should be
excited because, you know, sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the herbs that we test,
you know, brings out something special and
[SPEAKER_00]: we hold fast to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see where it goes from here and
what I'm smoking after today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your thoughts on outdoor
versus indoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a preference on outdoor versus
indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like indoor, but outdoor to me
carries the flavor that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of how about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect is different from the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor is more if it's if it's in deaker,
it's more down a vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the outdoor in deaker gives you an
upliftment that, you know, you appreciate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometime outdoor is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG outdoor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, especially OG outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all these different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living soil, though, living soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say sometimes indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm OK with smoking cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke cocoa indoor all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind salt, but I do really enjoy
living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil is I think is actually I think
is actually what's leading in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a living soil spliff is always nice to
compliment today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you can't go wrong typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's light it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you scared?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably sometimes, you know,
it is we get some weed and we can't I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive home, you know, so I got to be
careful of what I smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice gesture, but come on,
I'm scared a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: From first is what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's flavor in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some readiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little creaminess, a little breadiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could taste that creaminess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flavor is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got that nose bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had to guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you get another couple of hits
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can tell me, do you think
that is the five dollar or less?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ten dollar or less or the 15 plus?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely the ten dollars or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten dollars or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely the ten dollars or
less.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as oil, we're not getting too much
of an oil raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of starting, but it's not
burning clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, that's not it's not white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not white ash by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely ten dollars and under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ten and under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm right because it's got a nice
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten and under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten and under.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it got the flavor,
but it doesn't do anything otherwise than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good smoke though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to smoke that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the effect, let's talk about the
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I feel like it's mellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it's over 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take one more hit just to
confirm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take another hit just to confirm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you must feel the effect from a,
you take a draw of the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could creep on you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes we get some creeper
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we know about creeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got some Burr's Crepe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Burr's Place Grape and Crepe.
[SPEAKER_02]: See now, maybe it is 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's creeping up on me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burr's Place and it's Grape and Cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says it's above 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's above 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30% should rock your world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just about 30% though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was above 30%, I would push back
when I pull it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy as a consumer buying this
for that price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just where it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just where it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in California, that is a good
deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's value bargain weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people shop and buy
weed around that average area,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 and under, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dive into number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me about Trinidad and the
legalization over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been pushing forward with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to get a cultivation license and
distribution probably, or transportation
[SPEAKER_00]: at least license over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working on forming a cannabis
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of waiting around for them to
issue the license, which they are about to
[SPEAKER_00]: issue the first 10 license on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to be part of that
first 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've come a long way, I must say,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they've been working really hard
to meet standards and not be overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're actually taking their
appropriate time to do the right things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's our good friend Dr. Green,
Mr. Marcus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Marcus Green, my good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: The king of the hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, he tried politics just the
other day and, you know, he's doing well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say, you know, for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's Mr. Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know he's a very educated man,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a very educated man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll kill you with his hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats a lot of hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first experience with Trinidad
hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I must apologize for it being Mr.
Green, because he do go heavy on the... He
[SPEAKER_00]: goes heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, on the hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot sauce and weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gets high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to Trinidad and we went to St.
Vincent together in 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had an adventure over there working
with the Cannabis Authority over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we gave a lecture that was
supposed to be a 30 minute lecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it ended up being like a three
hour lecture.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on St. Vincent in
their future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, St. Vincent for me, I think,
you know, St. Vincent is very promising as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as the Herbs go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to be pioneers in
everything they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely in the future, they're going
to be a top runner for the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already stair ahead in their
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, we've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a special place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely a special place,
especially the soil they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got lava, molten lava that,
you know, covers the land from time to
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they always got fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some of the poorest people that
I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the happiest people, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the most enlightened people.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably be going back there soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you grew up going there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: On vacations and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vacation, no, but I always,
I got friends that I always go visit and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always, you know, when you leave your
home and go to, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you leave your home and go to a
different island, it's always party time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you leave in your country to go
there and sample the weed that 's in that
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back then, the Vinci, the St. Vincent
weed was like top number one on my island.
[SPEAKER_02]: So describe the Vinci weed for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like the weed now or the weed back
in the day, what you guys loved about the
[SPEAKER_02]: Vinci weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the effect or was it the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys did a lot of roll-ons,
too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I think it's a combination of a
lot of things that made that weed special.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, this weed was fluorescent
yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fluorescent yellow, like spongy or like
dry and hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not spongy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not spongy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dry, but it's not spongy and it's not
hard either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was there a lot of trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was properly grown and properly well
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could actually see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there seed in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was lots of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I wish you would have saved those
seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, I had no idea that we would
have been doing what we're doing today.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing about life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it prepares you for a lot of
things that you don't understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: because as soon as you find a seed,
you go and put it in the earth for sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to grow something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back then, we'd be collecting the seeds
and growing them out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: having not being able to grow it right and
get a bunch from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would get a smoke, a couple buds on
a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it used to be because control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds were not controlled,
so they couldn't yield the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you compare it to Orange Hill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, Orange Hill is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: In what ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Orange Hill, the strain in Orange
Hill is a land-raised strain that stands
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It knocks you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even explain the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about that Orange Hill weed is
you get it today, you smoke it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same effect every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get a different smoke of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think this is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is the $5 or less?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is the $15 or more?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually really surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we got an oil ring on this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's $5 though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know it's $5 because here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bargain right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it gets you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel high from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: More high than from the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about this $5 split with me,
I feel high while I'm smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we stop now, I feel.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is a $13.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Republic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Riverview Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gushmints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gushmints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gushmints.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got smalls of Gushmints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good bargain weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, check out the buds though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're good smalls though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while I'm smoking it, I'm feeling the
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we stop now, it went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I think it was $5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but if you compare these,
I think that's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as far as quality goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have tricked you.
[SPEAKER_02]: By putting another $5 one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a little bit about Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got back from Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been working with Don Corleone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don Corleone is an amazing producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kelly Keys, you know,
amazing writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Corleone, amazing producer,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my album this year is going to be
something that the Grammy is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the level of music that I think
it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us a little bit about your new
album.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to hear it in Atlanta when I was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm freaking blown away because it's a
different style than the others that you
[SPEAKER_00]: put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I sing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sing deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to go into the music that
uplift and really resonate with your
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this stuff, it's like blood to your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new style for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more uppity beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, at the same time,
it's still the message that I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to carry and portray myself as.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, man, I can't wait for people to see
what we've been cooking up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just filmed a bunch of videos for
it, too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica was nice, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Kingston, met with Sizzler,
my good friend Sizzler Colonji.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did a video for a song that we
did together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a big cookout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Sizzler's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You introduced him to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a super nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
Spiritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's strong, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff here is what I would go to the
dispensary for.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much would you pay for an eighth of
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seventy five bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seventy five bucks right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: SF Kana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are killing it, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is their Zerbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a Sunset Sherbert times Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, it's a fire breeder, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just it's it's a little bit
skittly, but it's super gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like the candy in it because it's
not too candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do I don't like diet
skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if it's going to have skittles,
it's got to be real candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the half candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has a little tiny hint of it,
but it's super strong in the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's mild taste of the skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the gas comes at you like,
whoa, gas and there's cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look how it burns clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that's a winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be nice in a pre-roll or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they do pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw something a while back,
but I haven't tried any of their
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they're probably good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're producing good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they got a bunch of different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Skittles that's friggin ultra
delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it has one of those uplifting
highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one thing Skittles is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that back flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavor are you getting from that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The back flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get cream, almost cookies from Girl
Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like creamy breadiness to it,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice, James.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so we're talking about Skittles
and Skittles is on this upward trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's become really popular again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always loved Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I smoked Skittles was in
2014 at the High Times Cannabis Cup in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Brandon from 3rd Gen walked up
to me and I was with Kenny from Tricom
[SPEAKER_02]: Technologies and we hit it and I was like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still to this day, I have that kind of
holy shit going every time I smoke them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh man, this is what weed should
taste like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if all the shit tasted on the
level that Skittles does, more people
[SPEAKER_02]: would smoke weed for one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the first time I got
Skittles, I was like, how did they do
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they infuse it with something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were like, man, this genetic
is going to be the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And So Said So Done Skittles is one of the
most sorted after strain right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's talk about our collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got Ganja Farmer Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell seeds together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make seeds and Marlon helps with the
selection process.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the face of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a good partner too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we make good music together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganja Farmer Seed has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met James and he fascinated me with the
works of the seed and how it actually is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the engine of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing a lot of good things
with the marijuana, breeding a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the process of selecting for me has
been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And James, I was kind of a one strain
minded guy, but then I learned to
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you went to GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: You went from OG to GMO and then you were
puffing hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were smoking GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like crazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff gets you super high,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You quit doing dabs and you were smoking
GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, actually the GMO reminded me of
dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could, I could smoke and dab at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I made a lot of good
music off of that GMO though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That meditation and that state of mind
that I needed to be in was necessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then you got into like lemon cherry
gelato, Pluto, we like Pluto for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pluto for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pluto was killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you know, for me getting to
appreciate the different strains and the
[SPEAKER_00]: way weed evolve, you know, it's been a
process for me, but I learned to navigate
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand that the weed is a industry
that grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's growing, a lot of different
things would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, I feel like we're
having positive impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having positive impact here talking
about cannabis for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a mainstream thing and people
looked at it negatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good people even looked at it negatively
because they didn't fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all fucking changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in a world where my parents
weren't heavy smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to say, I never thought I
would see the day that my mom would be
[SPEAKER_00]: using a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents have a CBD company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Wellness is the name of their CBD
company out of Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were against marijuana when I was
younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sanjay Gupta is the one that changed a lot
of it when he had a 60 minute special and
[SPEAKER_02]: he had kids that were being cured of their
disease with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad thing, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents back then, if they ever knew
that I'm involved in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have been bad for me because I
would have gotten whooping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were disappointed because I was
pretty honest with them all the way about
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing I think we both have in
common that very few people have in common
[SPEAKER_02]: is that if you looked at our 18 year old
selves and you told them what the fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing now, they would be like right
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to tell that story to your 18
year old self that this is the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: life you get to live and these are the
kind of things you get to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a blessing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traveling around the world has been a
blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's been such a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, God has really shown us a way to
love what we do and get to do it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing that our work is our
life, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're going to be in Spain
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: How blessed are we to get to go to Spain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Spannibus is going to be amazing this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the last time we were there,
we were like, oh, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, we're going back there with
a plan that we're doing this and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we kind of got, I'm not going to say
we got screwed, but COVID screwed
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely it was like right when we
were about to launch Ganja Farmer Seed
[SPEAKER_02]: Company in Europe, all of a sudden COVID
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this booth set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were running a good chunk on all this
stuff and doing it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a booth set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a beautiful booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like the banners up and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even get to use the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that kind of put us back a little
bit, but it's like, all this stuff happens
[SPEAKER_02]: for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that we're on the right path and
we're doing things the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Ganja Farmer Seed Company
is going to take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so much more to offer now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as, you know, genetics,
you know, it's the best that we can offer
[SPEAKER_00]: to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a good variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Ganja Farmer Seeds will be
available on James Ladd Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be online soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone will get to enjoy what we
enjoy, you know, which is growing good
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and getting good results when you
grow your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smoking good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think either one of us smoke
nearly as much as we used to, but we still
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a good amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can still put it down, especially joints
I love on my days off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't smoke as much from the days as
I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I sit down and remember when I
would smoke lunch all day, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember when you said dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, that's like you don't dab anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the cold start, you know,
the baby dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I take a dab now,
I would fall asleep immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got a pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, I do have a pen at home,
but I don't travel with it as much because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really go to the pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was the Farmer's Cup?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did the judging for the Farmer's
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of the entries?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a good time?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you this, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are sure being innovative,
you know, and trying to be the best at
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, sometimes you got to really
fine tune what you're giving to the world
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that it's absolutely the
best product cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like for myself is what I want to
present to people in any aspect of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sale, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something for people to
think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the Farmer's Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you judge just the flour or did you
judge the extract?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was chocolate entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through pure rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did some like drinks,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of the new beverages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I don't think I'm all that too fancy
of the flavors they're choosing though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's like the next big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if it's a Pacific,
you know, cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's limited to what those
people presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes a thought is not really good
in taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think so many products
conceptually say it's going to sound good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in your mind, it sounds like this is
going to be amazing, but you have to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of R and D and you can't just stop at
a certain point until it's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, over time, that's like what we
do with breeding and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, at least I try not to just
stop and go, that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted the best product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with something that's going to
be so competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better have something that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like everything with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better have a competitive product
these days to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you join in a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there is nobody there to compete
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just giving people something
that they're going to get accustomed to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people already know what they
want as far as cannabis culture goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to really come with something
that wows the taste buds or even their
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your new favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I just can't even say right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Mochi right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good Mochi and bad Mochi,
but I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mochi is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get a good Mochi.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get a good Mochi, you get a good
that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's all about tasty weed these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flavor is to die for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your flour, especially like if
you roll joints of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really surprised with the samples
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not the SF Can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to smoking SF Can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other two were for their price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't have a lot of money,
I would probably buy either one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest with you, I figured the
$5 left in my mind was going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen garbage weed in rec too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that wasn't garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like all three of those
definitely have their place in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in the market there is a buyer
for every for all three of those there are
[SPEAKER_00]: buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people smoke differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people that thinks that,
you know, oh, I can't smoke that Mochi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know people that they can't get
enough of that Mochi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely these three strain here
right here that we tested today have a
[SPEAKER_00]: place in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would definitely buy any one of them
and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ish.
Ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know what I would lean to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always like we want to smoke the
best stuff that we can afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a price point for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I heard about $1,800 ounces the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: $1,800 ounces living soil weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would probably be something that we
would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a sample of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the $1,800.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the $1,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to NorCalNemo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big respect to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of mind blown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm OK with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living soil is a really good concept,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silas, always running deck on IG,
grows some fucking crazy, crazy,
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy living soil weed that I really
appreciated over the last three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: years since I've known him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, he he presses it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see more growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flora Flame, you know exactly what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lauren Flame in Oakland are doing living
soil and they're doing it at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see some more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like the or even home growers,
home growers living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cleanness of the smoke is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the high from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps you high for a longer period,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's a different kind of high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like it's a different
kind of high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil, you know, it's like it's one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in my country in Trinidad,
there was this strain called Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could smoke any weed in Trinidad
that grown in Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this weed, when you get it,
you know, mind this shit is special,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing about some good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smoke whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get a good weed, it often,
you know, brings you back to that place of
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort and happy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I definitely will lean more towards
the more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate you coming on the show,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me,
James.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just want to say to all the fans
out there, look out for my new album.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are you going to launch the
videos at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually going to be launching a few
singles before it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leading up to the album.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a vast productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vast production is definitely looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got Sizzler on your album.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else is on the album?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sizzler, Luciano, Torres Riley,
Massica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Capelton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next album is going to have Rihanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're really into the,
you know, music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, you know, people recognize us for
the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're doing, you know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're putting out amazing stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate you coming on the show
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, James, for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tune in next week for the next episode of
The James Loud Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it love.
Thank you.
