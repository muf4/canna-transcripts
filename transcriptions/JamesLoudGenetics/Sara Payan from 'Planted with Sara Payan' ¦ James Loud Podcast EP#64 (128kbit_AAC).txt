[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going everybody welcome to
another episode of the James lab podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: and today our special guest is Sarah pion
from planted with Sarah pion So we met on
[SPEAKER_01]: 420, you know, I met some amazing people
on 420 You and your husband are definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that group and it was a
serendipitous day my friend had passed
[SPEAKER_01]: away and in the morning on 420 and You
know, I look back and Everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we get these blessings in life
and I feel like that day was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to meet Amazing people and
there was this amazing event that David
[SPEAKER_01]: Downs put on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, David's great Yep, and to be part of
that that was great and it was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: fun I feel like the perfect amount of
people it wasn't overcrowded like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: events are Mm-hmm, especially the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know it could be either be
completely dead or completely packed and
[SPEAKER_04]: you were filming your show there Yeah,
yeah, we did plant it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a bunch of people sitting in
including you Yeah, and we were talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about what 420 meant to us and it was
really nice Actually, I just talked to
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody yesterday who said that they
weren't able to make that event But it
[SPEAKER_04]: made them feel like they were there but
there were so many great people especially
[SPEAKER_04]: people who have done so much for the
movement in the industry and I need to be
[SPEAKER_04]: on that beautiful roof on a beautiful day
just being able to Share some smokes and
[SPEAKER_04]: and talk to people was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather was perfect Yeah, so now that
the roles are reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does 420 mean to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: 420 to me means first of all Community,
but also the patients because I'm old
[SPEAKER_04]: school guys You know like you I've been
doing this for a while and I started in
[SPEAKER_04]: the two 15 days and it was a year out of
chemo, so I really For me, it's all about
[SPEAKER_04]: social justice creating good policy to
support the people and a chance for us all
[SPEAKER_04]: to get together and really enjoy each
other's company because we're all so busy
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's so many things going on and
Especially with you know, the way things
[SPEAKER_04]: have been in California the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a lot to worry about yeah,
but there's also a lot of joy because We I
[SPEAKER_04]: for me like I love the work that we do But
one of the biggest things is the people I
[SPEAKER_04]: always joke that if you're in cannabis
You're part carny We're all a little
[SPEAKER_04]: weird, but it's like my kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: We eat carnies Yeah, some more than
others, but we all are absolutely part of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's part of a movement You know,
I think there's like the community and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's the movement and there's the
this will and this amazing Energy behind
[SPEAKER_01]: it and yeah, it definitely has some of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So for me, that's that's what it's
all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I I worked in a dispensary for many
years and I loved loved the excitement of
[SPEAKER_04]: people coming in and that was when you
know, we were Weighing out deli style so
[SPEAKER_04]: we would get flowers that we didn't see
any other time of the year and just seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: people's Excitement and all the fun things
that would happen and you'd always have
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody who would bring in some crazy
infused cake for the staff to have
[SPEAKER_04]: afterwards and it was just kind of like We
would work hard all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bring so much joy and then we'd get to
enjoy everyone's company afterwards and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's still even though I no longer work in
a dispensary I still feel that way when
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out with people during 420 because
it's you know We just have so many things
[SPEAKER_04]: to be grateful for and so many good people
to enjoy their company Yeah, there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean every day there's so many things to
be grateful for we can be upset about
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff or we can be grateful and I think a
lot of times people have like life
[SPEAKER_01]: Dismorphia and they're like my life sucks
and but they're not really counting their
[SPEAKER_01]: blessings and it's like there's so many
things to be grateful for We're not at war
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not fighting in war,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean that we're all war about
other stuff But but as far as like the the
[SPEAKER_01]: movements at war, but we're not Fighting
for our lives necessarily, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel like I wake up and I fight
for my life every day So that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a Jerry Garcia thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about cake, but he had a
story and I just the reels have been
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in on Instagram about the time
where he ate the cake and he He ate the
[SPEAKER_01]: frosting because he's like there's
definitely acid in the cake but I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna take some of the frosting and then
there was these mafia guys and They were
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in when he started tripping and
he's like, oh these guys are gonna kill me
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I he went on stage and then he was
playing for his life and So that really
[SPEAKER_01]: resonated with me and so like lately I've
been thinking, you know I need to get up
[SPEAKER_01]: because he said he's he's been playing for
his life ever since and so I feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to get up in the morning and I need
to Fight for my life every day and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I think that's a different kind of
battle But it's it's still like if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have that mindset like we got to do the
best we can every time we do it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we're doing podcasts or whether
you know, it's in the room with plants
[SPEAKER_01]: Really putting all my energy into the
stuff that I'm passionate about of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that is gonna help me survive and
make me successful I can see that I think
[SPEAKER_04]: for me like Every day is a gift and even
when things kind of go a little awry I
[SPEAKER_04]: always look at it as what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what is that driving me towards?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gonna create goodness because I
before I got into cannabis I worked in
[SPEAKER_04]: civil rights and before that I was in
corporate and corporate felt really empty
[SPEAKER_04]: for me I always joke that I'm an extremely
greedy person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like every moment to matter You know,
so I got into civil rights and I loved it
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know One of the things was that I
wasn't doing the direct work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was an ops manager So I kept the
lights on so that my colleagues could do
[SPEAKER_04]: their good work, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was always searching for that
meaning like well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that I need to do that fulfills
me and also does good, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: and then when I got sick and It was like
it was like a bad Country music song cuz
[SPEAKER_04]: it seemed like everything was happening
and I used to think to myself This is
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna make sense someday, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found my heart Work through that
because if I hadn't gotten sick you and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be sitting here today yeah,
I mean some of the most painful terrible
[SPEAKER_01]: things are blessings in disguise and they
make us stronger people they make us
[SPEAKER_01]: better people they make us more,
you know, it's the sour and the sweet you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't appreciate the sweet unless you've
had this hour and I love that and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that Suffering is a good thing to a degree
so that you can appreciate when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: good times Yeah, cuz gotta stop eventually
It's gotta stop eventually and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old enough now that I realized that
it's all gonna work out in the end and
[SPEAKER_01]: even though we go through these things and
they suck there's gonna be good days and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's gonna be bad days and Just
grateful that we're having good days right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and the weather is a little extreme
But uh, you know, that's that's part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know I'm enjoying the sunshine,
but it is I mean It's it's about how
[SPEAKER_04]: nimble can you be and how much can you be
like water?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not always gonna be easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's gonna suck Yeah,
but man, it sure does make the good times
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have some good stories at the
end You know, I think that's part of it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely Absolutely, and ten years
from now when we look back on this time,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering what we're gonna be thinking
Yeah, you know what will have happened
[SPEAKER_04]: between then and now what are we what will
we have learned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or or not learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's that too Yeah, there's both
both sides of the coin for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I honestly feel If you were to look
at a hundred years in the future a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: years in the past I kind of talked about
this a lot, but I feel like they'd say we
[SPEAKER_01]: were kind of crazy right now, but we're in
this in between Place between technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean who knows what's gonna happen in a
hundred years if we'll be around I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: we're around I think I think there's drive
and there's the will of the people and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, but people like well, what about you
know these these events that could happen
[SPEAKER_01]: earthquakes you know nuclear war I think
that I Think that we're gonna survive
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly, but I think if they were to look
back at this time People would say man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going on the stuff with politics
the stuff where cannabis is illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the cannabis being illegal and
we're putting people in jail for a
[SPEAKER_01]: nonviolent crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think it's silly and I think a hundred
years ago Maybe not a hundred years ago a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred fifty years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd think it was extremely silly,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean people going to jail for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of crazy When you think
about it, but I mean change doesn't come
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're comfortable Yeah, it gets it
has to get to a point where you're fed up
[SPEAKER_04]: with it Yeah, that's it and I think you
know when we are talking about all the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are going on now it's like
we're in this era of legalization and
[SPEAKER_04]: People forget that there are a lot of
people that are still in jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean we're doing you know the work that
you and I do every day and We have to get
[SPEAKER_04]: past that it's still it's still totally
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Absolutely, we got I mean I've had
Richard DeLisi on the show and Luke
[SPEAKER_01]: Scaramazzo that you know together They did
over 50 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah for the plant Yeah, I was actually
just talking to Robbie bigot today his
[SPEAKER_04]: family is the bigots and the boons were
the cornbread mafia yeah and talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: how much time that you know people in both
families have done and You know they had
[SPEAKER_04]: his sister Was murdered and the man who
murdered his sister got 25 years with the
[SPEAKER_04]: chance of parole But his brother Got 25
years Mandatory sentence for growing a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah That's messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is and I mean these laws
are slowly changing I mean not soon
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, but they are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you know we see stuff like
Scheduling and we're afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want D scheduling But we are progressing
forward I think in a lot of ways we're
[SPEAKER_01]: progressing forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think there's good and bad You
know, we saw the influx of really bad
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in California with legalization
initially and now we're seeing it correct
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm seeing better and better stuff
every day In the in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so but unfortunately it's there's
still The race to the bottom where if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the best stuff you might as
well not do it It's kind of how I feel I
[SPEAKER_04]: agree I mean if you if you don't have the
best stuff and you're not doing with
[SPEAKER_04]: heart, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Because you can tell when it's not
made with passion and heart to well and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not gonna compete with the big guys
that have Huge facilities that can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff at scale and pay pennies on the
dollar that can beat you on price That's
[SPEAKER_01]: true their exit price is much lower than
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, and then how do you compete?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have to have a better product
You have to have a better brand a better
[SPEAKER_01]: product, you know The brand has to back
the product now the marketing all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff before it was like You know the hype
wins and the hype still does win to a
[SPEAKER_01]: degree But if you look at you know,
these guys Backpack boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are putting great products in
their back SF Canada These guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: putting amazing product out to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only issue is the point from Harvest
to the consumer getting it to the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh Yeah, and I think it's the people
were talking about it now more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know refrigeration Getting it
there in a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the sooner you get a fresh product
the better it is Yeah, I mean now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: turplock bags they help with preservation
and other things but still fresh product
[SPEAKER_04]: is gonna win any day I Agree, but then
you're also looking at a subset of people
[SPEAKER_04]: like people who are more into
connoisseurship, which I think is What
[SPEAKER_04]: we've directed a lot of our attention to
yeah, but what about the normies?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about that whole swath of the market?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's looking at cannabis as wellness and
they may enjoy a really good flower sure
[SPEAKER_04]: But can they tell a really good flower
from amid?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know and so what is it that draws
them in then sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean we have like that That LA Times
article came out everybody that I know
[SPEAKER_04]: who's kind of curious or kind of on the
fringe the wellness are all like Now
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like, oh dear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it all bad?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like well, no, it's not I mean we
we have work to do Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of things to do for the
controls around, you know lab testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that But it's a nightmare out
there the whole lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a nightmare You know,
there's no consistency across the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's changing slowly but surely You
know, you're seeing 45% THC that's pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: wild Do you think that's true though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really think it's 45% because I
feel like somebody's yeah, absolutely not
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I'm saying is you're
seeing these super high lab results These
[SPEAKER_01]: coas that are saying 45% Yeah,
but then you could send that same product
[SPEAKER_01]: to another lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more reputable maybe or more
consistent and you're gonna see 35.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe 37 maybe yeah, maybe but these
40 plus I I don't know I I Have a hard
[SPEAKER_04]: time believing I do too and I also you
know Just the whole thing the whole race
[SPEAKER_04]: to the top with THC I just think
personally and and you know, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: be food will disagree with me on this but
I think it's BS because it's like I have
[SPEAKER_04]: had stuff that has been like 13% THC with
a really interesting terpian profile that
[SPEAKER_04]: Works wonderfully with my body and I'm
like, whoa This feels much stronger than
[SPEAKER_04]: something that I've had that's been in
like the mid to high 20s Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would tend to agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that It's an easy marker and it's
an easy way for a dispenser to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay Well, we have this this is how strong
it is, but that's not accurate not by any
[SPEAKER_01]: means I think that terpenes dictate a lot
flavorants we're talking about flavorants
[SPEAKER_01]: now thiles and flavorants and All these
other factors come into play And the the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference of a strong Narcotic Strain
versus a strong stimulant strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so it's so individual too you
could have one thing that like someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: loves the stimulant stuff and Then they
smoke a strong narcotic Indica if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to call it Indica but like something
strong and heavy and then they they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: feel right right or the opposite somebody
who's smoking these Candy flavors and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the gelatos in these and then
they go smoke some Super silver haze and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like my heart's beating out of my
chest So it's it's all subjective to the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual and we all have such different
body chemistries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really hard to Identify how they
should I mean people are talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: like flavors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll talk about Different flavor
profiles lemon orange citrus categorizing
[SPEAKER_01]: those together and then they can
categorize But some of the stuff is just
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so it makes it complicated it
does and it's I also find like cuz you
[SPEAKER_04]: know working with people's bodies and
cannabis like like I have over 18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: hours of working with human beings and
cannabis so I've seen Had the baseline of
[SPEAKER_04]: how the majority of human beings respond
I've seen people trip out on 30 to 1 CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: to THC and I'm like, you know instead of
being like I can't be right It's like I
[SPEAKER_04]: lean in I'm like, oh that's fascinating
what happened, you know, I want to know
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's also neurodivergence that
comes into play because I I've worked with
[SPEAKER_04]: people who have like a DD ADHD and they're
like, you know Durban poison or you know
[SPEAKER_04]: island sweet skunk or you know something
that for me would be like dab it And
[SPEAKER_04]: they're like that chills me out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like cool calm and clear and then I go
to the gym and I'm like saying But it's
[SPEAKER_04]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally amazing body chemistry being
so unique as it is I have some friends
[SPEAKER_01]: that can eat five Hundred milligrams of
THC and it doesn't do anything to like
[SPEAKER_01]: literally They could eat something that
would make someone feel like they were
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would doesn't Yeah, I think most people
five hundred milligrams will take you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but then Yeah, Kay his his wife from
trichome technologies his wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: She could Eat an unlimited amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that that's about liver
function.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so Yeah, I mean I that's I tell
people like when they're a little Looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at doing high amounts and I'm just like
well good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you if that affects you Whether
you believe in him or not, you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: holding on to the toilet talking to Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah You know, but then there are those
exceptions and it's like wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what to What do they need to help them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like inhaling may be good for them
Sublinguals might be good for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it's it's fascinating to see how
people react cuz like I have a relatively
[SPEAKER_04]: high tolerance for inhaling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a really low tolerance for eating
it same thing I'm exactly the same like I
[SPEAKER_01]: I do eat edibles from time to time But I
prefer low dose edibles now before we
[SPEAKER_01]: never measured dose like before ten years
ago There wasn't like oh, this is ten or
[SPEAKER_01]: twenty or thirty milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this is a brownie Yeah,
you know, this is a cookie or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had brownies cookies rice krispie
treats Irish moss drink Do you remember
[SPEAKER_04]: that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was a crazy one I got way too
high on that and was having a call with my
[SPEAKER_04]: oncologist actually an in-person meeting
and I was like I got to go home I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: have this conversation and then I went
home and bought a $300 espresso machine
[SPEAKER_01]: don't shop high So Irish moss drink is it
like bang like with milk It was like a
[SPEAKER_04]: non-dairy like some sort I can't remember
Right, it kind of felt like it but it is I
[SPEAKER_04]: had this herb Irish moss and it was a I
believe what I recall was that it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: gentleman from Jamaica who made it and it
was a creamy drink, but it was like some
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of plant milk and I don't even know
how many milligrams it wasn't then because
[SPEAKER_04]: like you said we weren't really worried
about that I just chug leg the whole thing
[SPEAKER_04]: so I was nervous about having my first
conversation about chemo and then I after
[SPEAKER_04]: that I realized only half or a quarter
like a quarter if you want to buzz a half
[SPEAKER_04]: if you just really want to be nice and
stoned and Be home anything more than that
[SPEAKER_04]: is for your body Sarah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't do that And I don't do
homemade edibles anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I if somebody gives them to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always grateful I'm always gracious,
but I do not touch anything that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know the milligrams for cuz five
milligrams does it for me now which You
[SPEAKER_04]: know back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I especially during the two
fifteen days It was more than that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm actually happy that it's just a
little bit and I use a little bit to sleep
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I'm not Groggy in the morning and
otherwise I smoke right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I'm a huge fan of Delta 8 I'm
gonna get some hate for that, but I really
[SPEAKER_01]: like the effect of Delta 8 It's it's 20%
the strength of like Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for sleep Delta 8 is my jam like 50
milligrams of Delta 8 gummies or a
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture whatever That has me sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not groggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel super rested I feel like it puts me
in a really deep sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if I do Delta 9 and now is to do
10 milligrams of Delta 9 and probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: want to sleep or I wouldn't get that good
asleep Is it so that one's a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: more cerebral for you then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean that's I I get that because
like I know for myself Delta 8 gives me
[SPEAKER_04]: like a nice fuzzy buzzy body feeling and
I'm not in my head But then like my
[SPEAKER_04]: husband it actually like Delta 8 masses
with him with his body chemistry Wow And
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's like, you know your mileage may
vary because I was like across the board I
[SPEAKER_04]: was like, oh Delta 8, you know It's just
it's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not cerebral for most of us It isn't
but then you get those particular body
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistries in and all bets are off for
sure I like CBG to CBG is another one and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like yeah CBG is just so mellow It's
like it's a good alternative for ibuprofen
[SPEAKER_01]: if people are interested in getting off
ibuprofen I think it's a great solution
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like it's also
anti-inflammatory I feel like it relaxes
[SPEAKER_01]: my muscles I feel I feel like it relaxes
me from the inside when I spoke it such a
[SPEAKER_01]: strange thing like Stuff that's higher in
CBG and I usually don't just do straight
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG It's a blend because it's a full
spectrum smoke of whatever flow garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does Hemp and he has some of the heavy
Z that he got seeds for me and sent me
[SPEAKER_01]: some flour and it's high in CBG uh-huh and
It was the most interesting thing because
[SPEAKER_01]: when you smoke it I feel like you exhale
and then it's one of those instant ones
[SPEAKER_01]: where all of a sudden you start feeling
relaxed And there's there's depth to that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just hit you right at once It
kind of gradually makes you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're settling into your couch Even
though you're not moving you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of not not like you're melting
in like you're high But like you're just
[SPEAKER_04]: getting relaxed and I love that I like
that I have not smoked CBG but I've had it
[SPEAKER_04]: like in tablets and I have a tincture that
I like that has a little bit of THC some
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD CBBG and CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and for me because My I have so much
going on in my brain It calms me so that I
[SPEAKER_04]: can focus and I can do things and I was
actually working with a family friend who
[SPEAKER_04]: was who had esophageal cancer and He has
been sober for over 40 years and he was
[SPEAKER_04]: having problems with eating and nausea and
also stress and He wanted to see about non
[SPEAKER_04]: euphoric ways to be able to use it because
one of his greatest wishes was to die a
[SPEAKER_04]: sober man Wow, and we used that and he was
so incredible Happy he's like it helped me
[SPEAKER_04]: eat it helped calm me down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize I was stressed help the
nausea and I feel at peace because I've
[SPEAKER_04]: I've stayed with my wishes with not having
any sort of you know, just staying sober
[SPEAKER_04]: and that That felt really good and I and I
find like with CBD as much as I like that
[SPEAKER_04]: I get forgetful on that one It makes me a
little spacey, even though it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah interesting my brain,
you know Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all subjective to the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, we're so different because
like CBD doesn't do that to me at all I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like CBD relaxes me even if I dab CBD
Like my friend had this crazy CBD flower
[SPEAKER_01]: that they turned into extract and it was
like this crazy BHL Did it taste like
[SPEAKER_04]: cherries?
[SPEAKER_01]: this one tasted like cherry cough syrup
and It was is many Mike and this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: while ago my buddy from Washington and
When I dabbed it I just it was like taking
[SPEAKER_01]: a heavy dose of some anti-inflammatories
Like that was the feeling I got from that
[SPEAKER_01]: but it did it doesn't mess with my memory
at all It just made me really relaxed and
[SPEAKER_01]: chill kind of like CBG but different like
they're very Similar but different as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as how they affect my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm THC is another one where you eat it
and it doesn't really do anything but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really beneficial I like that for me if I
ever grow I just put it in my I don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not growing big beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just making plant smoothies I do
make plant smoothies with it and I find
[SPEAKER_04]: that it like just Makes me like very calm
throughout the day like having that THC a
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so good It'd be interesting to do a
comparison with different genetics That
[SPEAKER_01]: have different chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for plant smoothies So I'm big into a
and B testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're like, okay Well, what does this
do compared to this and we do that with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything around here We got the Dosatron
versus the agri-tech irrigation system and
[SPEAKER_01]: we have different lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Under canopy we have light lifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just we're testing at everything and
I'm constantly like how can I make this
[SPEAKER_01]: better?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I make the genetics better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's interesting because I never
even thought about tell you just talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, but really testing somebody
who's Juicing the plants is like if we
[SPEAKER_01]: give you leaves and you juice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this affect you compared to this
is we have Like a hundred different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that we're working on right now
So we could easily give you a little bag
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaves and you can compare it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool Well, you know and then
you think about if you're making a
[SPEAKER_04]: smoothie you're adding fruit to it So
you're getting other terpians in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how is that skewing it too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I love getting nerdy with
you It's a lot of fun and the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I feel like Almost like an
explorer like we're able to be explorers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to be scientists, even though
I'm not a scientist I Am able to do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the scientific stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and now we have these awesome tools
So like on the computer like logging data
[SPEAKER_01]: recording data We're able to take 50 over
50 data points on each cultivar that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have so when we're popping seeds that one
individual plant we we log all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different points of information and then
as we breed stuff, we really get to know
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and it's fun and interesting
and you know, the thing is is like you can
[SPEAKER_01]: change one thing in the life of the whole
Plant and that could change the chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: profile of it so yeah one also like when
you're looking at like Terroir,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, if you if you're stressing something
out, that's gonna change things too for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure It's just so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that when you're doing your pheno
hunts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you collecting all the data there?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing all the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we just data mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool We log massive amounts of
data on everything and so we're constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting data whether it's indoors
greenhouses Outdoors, we're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: separating that but we breed for specific
things like if we're breeding for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: we're Testing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but we're also testing stuff
outdoors to see how it performs outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: to see if that's the direction We should
go with something And kind of when you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it out one time you kind of get an
idea, but we grow from clone not from seed
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get rid of that seed start typically if
we were doing for outdoor first people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are planting acres We'd want to test
it from seed But a lot of times we're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting and testing to sell clones So if
we're gonna be selling clones or genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: in clone form or tissue culture We want to
see how it performs after the first
[SPEAKER_01]: initial run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm So it keeps it keeps things
interesting and there's so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: projects that we have going on all at the
same time So we really try to stay on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's that's got to be so much fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I mean I always enjoy like testing out
like trying out different phenotypes of
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers and just Like just as like a
person who's partaking and just seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: what's what happens with certain things
like even when I was You know in in the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary and we would get a flower that
would come in several times and people
[SPEAKER_04]: would be like Oh, it looks different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh The experience was different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it smells a little different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, it's not made in a
factory It's nature, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're gonna have variations But what
do you think as far as like how people are
[SPEAKER_04]: being able to kind of drill down and
create?
[SPEAKER_01]: support consistency with plants Well,
the thing is is like the the life of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant if in flower is like roughly 70 days
And it could be affected that one Clone if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going from clone or you know,
if you're growing from seed, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different But if you're trying to get
consistent you're growing from clone and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a clean clone that doesn't have
any systemic bacteria pest or pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is is nutrition and environment
affect the outcome So if you want we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about chemo type, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at a chemo type and we're
trying to get a specific profile You want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have that consistent throughout the
lifestyle?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want to try to mimic exactly and
record as much data so you can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: same results every time Yeah, but one
thing goes off your humidity fluctuates
[SPEAKER_01]: that could change it the light intensity
that could change the chemical profile at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end so the user could get a different
experience and That's the hard thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know as far as looking at it from a
pharmacist Perspective as smokable flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know because you can extract it and
you can pull stuff out You know frac
[SPEAKER_01]: fractional distillation and all these
other methods that people are able to use
[SPEAKER_01]: you can Separate a lot of the cannabinoids
and you can separate terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all these really cool things
And then you can have a consistent product
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can test it but to get the
flower consistent every time That's very
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to do extremely hard to do and I mean
you need it needs to typically be grown
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors Because if you think about the
light the the light cycle throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: year changes in a greenhouse or an
outdoor, you know You're looking at you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, if you're planting multiple times a
year You're gonna get a different
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and just like wine making the
wine comes out different every year If
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing outdoor your outdoor flower
comes out a little bit different every
[SPEAKER_01]: year, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's the same genetics,
you know and wine and they're they they
[SPEAKER_04]: come back every year Well, then that kind
of goes back to like, you know and and and
[SPEAKER_04]: so many people like I'm so tired of
talking about this but when we when people
[SPEAKER_04]: will talk about indica versus sativa and
of course, we know that that's not correct
[SPEAKER_04]: and that you know, but Getting into like
the chemo types.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where we're really nailing it like
because you will see or at least back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day you saw like maybe something that
showed up on the more uplifting side of
[SPEAKER_04]: the menu and then another batch would show
up and something that's like more hybrid
[SPEAKER_04]: II or a little bit more drowsy and Like
really nailing it by getting into the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemo type But then how do we my question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is always just kind of like how do we
create that lexicon so that the public?
[SPEAKER_04]: Understands it and it's not just those of
us that are really passionate about what
[SPEAKER_04]: we do and we're all like ooh, you know I
think this is a discussion that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening the the ganji a's that are out
there, you know, they're having this
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion they have their own ways of
training and testing and I think I Think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a bigger conversation that we
all need to keep constantly having and
[SPEAKER_01]: debating debate without fighting yeah,
but Discuss because I think when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into you know indica and sativa
that was great for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Something that people could
relate to you go in I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the indica or I want the sativa
Yeah, but really moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what people did for years,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like it's so much more
complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many more Things that
you know the boxes that need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: checked, especially if you know if someone
in a dispensary How do you help people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, you can't do it off just indica
sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't but even that in itself like
when you tell someone, you know These are
[SPEAKER_04]: just kind of placeholders to describe the
spectrum of feel like getting your average
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna call your normies to even
understand that like I remember back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day when I was just smoking whatever
you got like Your guys showed up with a
[SPEAKER_04]: few, you know Roaster bags of stuff and
they'd be like I've got sour diesel I've
[SPEAKER_04]: got granddaddy purple and I've got some
headband and you'd be like, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: which one should I get and they'd be like
I don't know all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Exactly, especially now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could have all three of those
right in front of me right now I know
[SPEAKER_04]: right but back then I used to think when
people would talk about indica and sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was always like some some friend of
mine who smoked a lot of weed and had
[SPEAKER_04]: liked frisbee golf and I was like whatever
you pretentious ass, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then after you understand it is
important to be able to talk about the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that there are lots of different
cultivars with lots of different fields
[SPEAKER_04]: and But getting the public to understand
just that was difficult and now that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're hanging on to that How do we rip
that away from them and give them
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's more accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just do it slowly but surely and I
think over time things change It's just
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's one of those hard discussions,
but it's like people saying strain instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivar Yeah, we've been saying strain
and that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wrong wrong wrong strands of
viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah COVID yep strains of COVID But you
know and then mushrooms you could say
[SPEAKER_01]: strains go along with mushrooms fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm, but a cultivar is the correct term
variety cultivar cross Not strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know that that's a it's an
interesting conversation But like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting away from that slowly,
but surely people are saying cultivar I
[SPEAKER_01]: hear it more and more that makes me so
happy I'm okay with strain just because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like the industry standard and so to
talk to people I still have to call it
[SPEAKER_01]: strain because Some people are just it's
it's over their head and it's okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not trying to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always go I always go You know cultivar
also known as you know also referred to as
[SPEAKER_04]: a strain, but I always try to say cultivar
first So like get it in their head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like cultivar cultivar cultivar I just
want people to feel that I'm not I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I'm better than them Right,
you know or pretentious or whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're friendly about it They know
for sure, you know, sometimes sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes but yeah, the whole strand
thing has got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's been gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully but I still You know the
old-school guys, you know, the guys
[SPEAKER_04]: old-school if you say in strand Yeah,
and I don't correct them from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been there way longer than I have
I'm gonna I'm gonna leave that be cuz I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: just a newbie I'm a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna correct everybody that says
strain or strand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that's not my job Yeah,
I feel that I feel that I'm out here
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to argue about stuff He's
trying to cultivate conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So yeah, so tell us about your show
for our guests.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they're excited to watch your
show Oh, well, I have been excited to do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are on our fifth year Yeah,
so planted with Sarah pion is on the radio
[SPEAKER_04]: miss fits network out of Chicago,
but you can listen to it wherever listen
[SPEAKER_04]: to it Yeah, listen to wherever you listen
to your favorite podcast and we've we've
[SPEAKER_04]: had a lot of amazing guests and actually
Today we just got in Forbes which was
[SPEAKER_04]: really super exciting and it was to
highlight our new sponsorship with Yerma
[SPEAKER_04]: Kalkinen of Jefferson airplane in a hot
tune of fame has a CBD brand called
[SPEAKER_04]: Yerma's Choice So they have naming rights
for the podcast now and we just added
[SPEAKER_04]: another new sponsor to our Sponsor family
the National Association of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses So that's been super super
exciting, but we've had a lot of great
[SPEAKER_04]: guests I was lucky enough to get an
interview with the late great David Crosby
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the last interviews before he
passed really cool and cross was the best
[SPEAKER_04]: and we had little Stephen on We've had
Peter Coyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had MSNBC's Michael Steele.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had the Democrat Democratic
firebrand Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett
[SPEAKER_04]: on the show and our very own Barbara Lee
also We've got Rick Steves coming up which
[SPEAKER_04]: are super excited about and Of course,
you know a lot of our industry friends and
[SPEAKER_04]: family have been on it too, right and
you're going to be on it Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely 100% looking forward to that So
tell me about Peter Coyote because I bet
[SPEAKER_04]: that was a really cool interview It was
and a lot of people say that it was one of
[SPEAKER_04]: their favorites and the funny thing is is
that Peter is sober But his he told his
[SPEAKER_04]: first I was asked guests about their first
cannabis experience and his was crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: because like they went to Mexico and they
got like a whole bunch of weed and they
[SPEAKER_04]: like hit it underground they ended up like
getting busted for it and it was just you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, he's you know being like the
activist he was all the crazy things that
[SPEAKER_04]: he did he just He he had a really really
good story But then you know, he's also a
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddhist monk now And so now he is talking
about the fact that he believes in the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal use of cannabis But he feels
like for you know Euphoria and things like
[SPEAKER_04]: that that in our world We tend to do a lot
of things to distract ourselves instead of
[SPEAKER_04]: grounding and being comfortable within our
bodies So he was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe instead of getting high you meditate
And so it was it was really fascinating
[SPEAKER_04]: because he's just a lovely human being and
he's done so much I mean aside from being
[SPEAKER_04]: like a prolific actor.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a musician and an author and he
actually narrated a documentary on medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis Several several years so many
documents hasn't he though and he's got
[SPEAKER_01]: that voice It's totally recognizable the
second you hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need to watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it So it was it was a delight
and you know, he's just over in Sebastopol
[SPEAKER_04]: So nice and then right after that is when
I got Crosby and Crosby was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh That Peter Coyote.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a rascal.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a ladies man and I was like Yeah,
I bet that interview is amazing as well
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, it was we we went all over the place
and we actually got into Some really
[SPEAKER_04]: really deep stuff because at that point in
time he was saying, you know I probably
[SPEAKER_04]: have three to five more years to live
Sarah And I have so much more to do and he
[SPEAKER_04]: had his hands were starting to work better
So that he was able to play the guitar
[SPEAKER_04]: again because he had stopped for a long
time So he was working on a new album He
[SPEAKER_04]: was a perpetual student and he was always
doing so much to lift younger artists up
[SPEAKER_04]: and just really excited about working with
people and and seeing kind of what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: into and what makes them tick and he we
had a conversation about him being afraid
[SPEAKER_04]: of dying and When I was going through my
chemotherapy, I went through Chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_04]: called full Fox five.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom is a cancer researcher So she
actually did the clinical trials on the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemo that I took years later and I ended
up being very allergic to the platinum
[SPEAKER_04]: salts The oxaloplatin that they gave me
and I almost died twice during it but the
[SPEAKER_04]: first time it happened I was in the chemo
chair and my body was freaking out and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was going into anaphylaxis and In inside I
was very calm even though the outside was
[SPEAKER_04]: very frantic I was not in control of my
body and I was watching people rush around
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was thinking to myself I was very
calm and I was like, ah I'm dying Who knew
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like and then it changed I told him
that story and I was like and then it
[SPEAKER_04]: really like calmed me and and and gave me
this whole other perspective about death
[SPEAKER_04]: where I always was afraid of it and I'm
not anymore and he was he said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I hope I feel that way when it
comes So when he passed it just because he
[SPEAKER_04]: was just months later.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just tore me up but we had such an
amazing conversation and I actually had
[SPEAKER_04]: given him some questions that had come
from our listeners and one of them was you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, What should we tell kids about
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like in typical cross fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him the truth You know, just just
tell him what's happening and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know He was he was a delight and I was
really looking forward to spending more
[SPEAKER_04]: time with him I was I was gonna go to his
garden in the summer when all of his
[SPEAKER_04]: plants were going I guess it had a bunch
of cannabis that was in kind of like a
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese garden And I was really excited
to spend some time with him and Jan but it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't to be but I was really grateful for
the time that I had with them and then
[SPEAKER_04]: with little Stephen from the East Street
band that was that was a great
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation where he had tried cannabis
when he was younger and He was of the ilk
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know, it was very psychedelic for
him So he got what he he needed out of it
[SPEAKER_04]: and he stopped using it But he understood
the medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he has a CBD brand and he also has a
high THC brand in Massachusetts I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: may be in some other states as well But
the question that I asked him was because
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he was on Sopranos.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked him I said would Silvio use
cannabis and he just Crack up and he's
[SPEAKER_04]: like no Buddy sell it Yeah, yeah,
and then we just got into politics because
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he's a very political guy so we
went down that rabbit hole What's your
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite part of the podcast that you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it all I think with podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things where like I've
heard people Say, you know, there are a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of work, you know people get tired of
doing them But you have to love it to do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to you know, absolutely and then
I love connecting with people and talking
[SPEAKER_04]: with them and I love hearing back from
people because You know unlike with yours
[SPEAKER_04]: where we get to hang out here I only have
a few that have been in person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is pretty much virtual So I
really love the fact that it gets people
[SPEAKER_04]: to think because you know my podcast not
only appeals to our colleagues,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's also people who may not be
immersed in cannabis and it's thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: about How cannabis is and it's almost a
macro micro thing like it's a call to
[SPEAKER_04]: critical thought It's a call to think
about how everybody is different It's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like when I teach my classes and
I tell people, you know, we may produce
[SPEAKER_04]: our own endogenous cannabinoids in our
bodies Not all of us tolerate phyto
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it doesn't work For you and it's not
right for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't necessarily mean that it
shouldn't be allowed Yeah, we need to we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to have these conversations and see
the beauty and all of our differences but
[SPEAKER_04]: also feel empowered to be catalyst for
change and and that's That's what I love
[SPEAKER_04]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Being able to hear about people's
experiences Learn from them and to be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to share that with listeners is it's a
labor of love for me and and to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: talk with people like you and to be able
to you know, not only have you on my show
[SPEAKER_04]: but to be able to come on yours and really
like appreciate the fact that There are a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of us doing this and we're all doing
really interesting stuff and I really
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy that I feel like we're all just part
of this bigger machine Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean not not just us but the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all part of like this amazing
Machine and you know, I did not even a
[SPEAKER_01]: machine but this entity and this this for
driving force and this consciousness Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be part of that I'm just happy to
be part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just just super blessed and to be
able to get people's stories and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to Be that guy who's part of the oral
history and recording because I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna learn different in the future
the books are great and The way people
[SPEAKER_01]: have learned is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think down the road we have instead
of One person's perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 100 200 300 500 thousands of
people's stories about the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, you know if we talk about
Alcohol and Prohibition, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we we've heard stories from handful of
people But it's not the same picture that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have now for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's um, I think really putting faces
to those voices is Super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of the things when we get into
conversations about policy and I remember
[SPEAKER_04]: like when I worked in a dispensary and you
know after legalization a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite products and brands and growers
were gone and The prices went way up and
[SPEAKER_04]: especially people who were counting on
this for a true medicinal use Were very
[SPEAKER_04]: upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of tears.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a lot of anger There was a lot
of finger pointing saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the brands are greedy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're greedy and it was like,
okay, so Let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk let's talk About how the
sausage is made, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason that everything's gotten really
expensive and you're missing some of your
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite products and you're missing some
of your favorite growers is because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really hard to survive in this industry
and There's taxation all along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may teach you what excise taxes Uncle
Sam is your your silent partner exactly
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was like and if you don't like the
way that Availability is and prices and
[SPEAKER_04]: the structure of how you can legally
acquire cannabis in your state.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a voice Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulators are making these decisions
based on outdated views of who you are So
[SPEAKER_04]: it's time to come out and say I use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I contribute to society I pay uncle Sam
and a vote Get active right it matters
[SPEAKER_01]: more than you think Yeah, and these
podcasts normalized the people that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Were previously outlaws and you start
looking at them and listening to their
[SPEAKER_01]: stories and it's like all of a sudden you
realize they're people too and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: good people And sometimes things that are
illegal aren't bad Yeah, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: things they're illegal that are legal are
terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, like McDonald's french fries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but they're so good So do you smoke in
the morning afternoon evening or all I do
[SPEAKER_04]: it in the evening now when I I used to
smoke Throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but my work has changed like when I
was working in in the shops I'd always I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: have like a little before I came in and
I'd have some at lunch and then I'd have
[SPEAKER_04]: some after work Yeah, and now I find that
a little bit of THC is okay, but it can be
[SPEAKER_04]: a little distracting with my brain Yeah,
and if I have a lot to do because I'm like
[SPEAKER_04]: writing and doing other things I I still
use cannabinoids during the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm doing CBG CB CBG CBD and just a
tiny bit of THC or THCV yeah, because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's really great with my brain and then
I get stuff done because Then I can look
[SPEAKER_04]: at my long list of stuff through the day
and I'm like, oh, I know what to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: that but too much THC and then I'm like
Maybe I'll take a little break and get
[SPEAKER_04]: back to it later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not gonna do that work that I
know Yeah, I mix it up every day is a
[SPEAKER_01]: different day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like life is like a box of
chocolates You never know what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get with me, especially,
you know It just depends on when I go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the gym in the morning Sometimes I smoke
before I go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I don't I usually hit a pen and
get like a little hit if I have a Lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cardio or it's something I really want to
focus Cannabis really helps me focus when
[SPEAKER_01]: I exercise or if it's something I don't
really want to do but it's something I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's in repetition Cannabis is a
great solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I know some people who say that red
Congo is their thing that they do before
[SPEAKER_01]: they go to the gym I really like red
Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like it's funny because Durban and
red Congo are both African I love Durban
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different like One makes you
laugh like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one gets you extremely high the
Durban just gets you higher than high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah My experience is with it I had one
with Marlon where we just got way too high
[SPEAKER_01]: on a episode of the James Loud show before
the James Loud podcast Uh-huh and the red
[SPEAKER_01]: Congo we've done the same thing where we
just laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes me laugh It makes me it puts
me in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me laugh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets me extremely high as well But I
find that red Congo is one of the most
[SPEAKER_04]: polarizing flowers people either love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or they don't and I would always
tell people smell it before you smoke it
[SPEAKER_04]: because if you Because people who like red
Congo and this is a broad generalization
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seems like they can't get enough of
the aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, ooh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's totally my thing But that other
people that are like not so much and then
[SPEAKER_04]: they smoke it they're like, yeah and I'm
that person because for me I Appreciate
[SPEAKER_04]: red Congo and I love the bud structure
like that those crunchy fluffy buds Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it doesn't work well with my body and
I don't like the aroma of it But I always
[SPEAKER_04]: love watching people who love red Congo
like get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love red Congo I and the thing is is I
smoke a lot of skittles and Gelato crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's mostly what's going around
with my friends and circle of people and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the stuff I'm breeding for is
purple candy, but I also love a good gas
[SPEAKER_01]: strain Yeah, I love OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sour diesel and then the super
silver haze the red Congo's the Durbin
[SPEAKER_01]: like if I get Them I can't get enough of
them while I have them and I'll like smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to share them with everybody
And then my friends like I don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: like that Some of my friends are like anti
they're anti sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're anti.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can't be afraid of sativa There's
one for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, but I think there's also
people that are like that's not my jam
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I hate tangy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of friends that hate tan like
hate tangy They use the word hate really
[SPEAKER_01]: tangy and I think if you look at how many
awards Tangy won there's a reason they won
[SPEAKER_01]: those awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hate on tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hate blue dream Yeah, I mean not
smoke blue dream a lot I have a joint of
[SPEAKER_04]: blue dream right over there actually dream
has I don't smoke it a lot but as a
[SPEAKER_04]: special place in my heart because It's a
functional strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is and that one got me through chemo
every Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: My nurse would come unhooked me for my
chemo I'd be on it Wednesday through
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd smoke a little that I go to my local
cafe I'd have my huevos rancheros and all
[SPEAKER_04]: was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some good stuff best game I ever
bold was on blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: See he's above 200 and I'm not even a good
bowler Yeah, it's one of those things it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very function for me it's a functional
thing and I don't mind the taste I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: mind the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's got blue like a really good blue
dream is really good Like it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I've seen sticky amazing resonance
Blueberries like you open the bag up and
[SPEAKER_01]: then some people are just like I hate blue
dream and that's subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything's so subjective I used to be
one of those people that used to think
[SPEAKER_04]: that they couldn't have the more uplifting
flowers I used to think ah, that's what
[SPEAKER_04]: gets me anxious.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then like the first time I had lamb's
bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh Lamb's bread is so unique
like the real lamb's bread and like we've
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it called a couple different
things Yeah, same years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But every time it's got this muskiness to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost parmigiani It's almost
parmigiani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny thing is is like the last
time I saw some across actually They're
[SPEAKER_01]: from Sonny Chiba He was at Harborside
Farms at the time and he was showing me
[SPEAKER_01]: this lamb's bread cross And he's like
smell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you smell like lamb's bread is the
first thing they came to mind I like lambs
[SPEAKER_01]: are he's like the Lambert lambs bread
cross It's like that the aroma of lamb's
[SPEAKER_01]: bread is so unique It's got this musky
strange Savory kind of smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's herbaceous and savory and I
really really like that smell and I love
[SPEAKER_04]: the buds Structure on that one,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I there's I have this one favorite that I
only had once and I never found it again
[SPEAKER_04]: it was when I first started working in the
shop and it was a blueberry granddaddy
[SPEAKER_04]: purple and it was so Calming like the day
fell off your shoulders blueberry
[SPEAKER_04]: granddaddy purple blueberry granddaddy
purple only saw it once and then later on
[SPEAKER_04]: I found something that was almost as good
it was a It was a bubba kush purple Urkel
[SPEAKER_04]: cross burkel burkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the burkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long time That was like 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no I saw it 20 years 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the burkel Yeah, there was a guy
who used to back in the 215 days used to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell it to the store and it was really it
had like it was it didn't look like those
[SPEAKER_04]: those crazy pictures of purple buds that
you see now or you're like Did you die
[SPEAKER_04]: that or have you thrown that through a
Photoshop filter?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it definitely you saw the purple in
there and I think it was the last time I
[SPEAKER_04]: saw that was Maybe seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow Yeah, we had the Larry bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another one that was amazing all
my friends that watch the show They know
[SPEAKER_01]: all about the Larry bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Larry bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was just another good one I
mean there was so many different things
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingrid Ingrid was another great one It's
funny that you said that cuz I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about Ingrid like maybe three or
four days ago and I'm like we haven't even
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about that in forever and then you
brought It up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of another like kind of almost
savory sort of flower Yeah, there was we
[SPEAKER_01]: had the ogre and the Ingrid were going
around around the same time a long time
[SPEAKER_04]: ago and yeah Yeah, I can't do cheeses
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make me crabby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know why I know so many
people who love them and I used to Explain
[SPEAKER_04]: to people and they'd ask about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, it's like video game weed,
man Smoke it sink it at the couch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah play your games.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me I get just really like Not
wanting to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably wasn't up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I I stay away from that Yeah,
doesn't make me paranoid just makes me
[SPEAKER_04]: like the couch lock doesn't do it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about trainwreck?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does trainwreck do for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends or Jack.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Jack you like Jack and I know some
people that really freaks them out I like
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people but they never got good
Jack is my my guess for the most part is
[SPEAKER_01]: they never really got to see The good Jack
or some of the jack crosses that we had I
[SPEAKER_04]: cleaned my house With Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And then trainwreck is one of those
ones that was super super strong real
[SPEAKER_01]: trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the arcade or trainwreck that was
like super strong Kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have this lady who came in She
was in her 80s and she would that was one
[SPEAKER_04]: of my first like when I started realizing
that people from all walks of life Yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke weed and she if you saw her you
wouldn't you'd never be thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh this woman like likes to smoke she'd
come in she Was just like this little lady
[SPEAKER_04]: and she's like I love me some rec you got
that reckon It would crack me up that was
[SPEAKER_01]: her jam every day all day love that it's
funny because I Have a friend who good
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyer friend of mine who I don't think he

it's kind of like og's like nah,
[SPEAKER_04]: not the same Every everyone knows what
they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't straight up og is hit or miss with
me, but like Like when when like fire og
[SPEAKER_04]: and godfather og were out I used to like
those you don't see those too much anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just it's depends like so that
really piney where you get that where it
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes like pine and citrus Or it's almost
like fresh pine needles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that You know, it's like and the
thing is is when it tastes that good down
[SPEAKER_01]: at the roach That's when you know,
you got something special and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: because the effect from good og2 is like
one of those ones where Just makes you
[SPEAKER_01]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of those I wouldn't consider
it a morning or evening it's one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time sort of things and I could
smoke at any time of the day sour diesel I
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't do sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sour that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's The one that I had when I was
a kid that made me stop smoking for a
[SPEAKER_04]: while couch lock no Panic panic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It totally freaked my brain out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Yeah, right, you know and I know so
many people who love it but when people
[SPEAKER_04]: used to come in from New York and they
would be like Totally looking at the menu
[SPEAKER_04]: and like their eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'd look at me be like you can
get something besides our diesel today
[SPEAKER_01]: Hilarious Yeah, it's like that's the way
that was the big thing still is the big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Piff Piff is a new the new I don't
know that I have some flour at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Piff is a It's a nl5 or it's a
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's a nl5 Hayes cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and it's got this really unique
aroma to it and it's not like space rocket
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativa do you smell the nl5 in it you For
sure smell the the nl it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's it's unique and but it's like
there's a lot of crosses, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Fort Collins cough also has that same
in there But it's it's more of a mellow
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of buzz and it's not super strong for
for it being an uplifting on the Stimulant
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the palette or a stimulant side of
the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely kind of more mellow,
but it tastes great It's got this really
[SPEAKER_01]: great You know, and the thing is is like
the smoke is velvety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm I like it when it's like that
velvety kind of smoke my buddy Josh grows
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it's like one of those ones Josh
Freeman He's been around a long time and
[SPEAKER_01]: he's really good at growing all kinds of
stuff living soil He does he does soil
[SPEAKER_01]: always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that piff he has It's like it's
amazing and it has a lot of subtleties in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's complex with subtleties.
[SPEAKER_04]: The smoke is good and It's mellow see that
would be something like a lot of people I
[SPEAKER_04]: know who are like in their their 50s late
40s 50s early 60s their biggest complaint
[SPEAKER_04]: is I can't smoke anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is so strong That sounds like
that would be one that you could be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know You can actually have a couple
pups of this and enjoy it not worry about
[SPEAKER_04]: freaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe not
[SPEAKER_01]: The high octane One of my buddies is like
could I just buy some leaves off you cuz
[SPEAKER_01]: like I just missed the weed back in the
day That was all leaves Give you some
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can CBD leaves too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got CBD leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are Make you feel like, you know
right out of the 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's I but I was work when I was in
the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a very famous comedian who came
in and I won't name names, but he was like
[SPEAKER_04]: he said shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all smoke now is too strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I sent him home with can of tonic I
was like look at like a one-to-one or a
[SPEAKER_04]: two-to-one and he came back and he was
like that shits my jam Yeah, totally into
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That reminds me of what I use is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's one of those I feel like the
flavors if you get good can of time
[SPEAKER_01]: because they've there's seeds of it that
have gone around So there's all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm, but can of time the real
one-to-one the classic Is amazing the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of it is great Yeah, it's one of
those ones where it just I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a great one for someone who doesn't
want to get too high Yeah, just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the effect and they want to have good
time with their friends But they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be high they they get because I
have a lot of older friends That grew weed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like burnouts now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I don't smoke weed anymore,
but I feel like Those guys can probably
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke some can of tonic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, and I like to mix it I mean,
I'm a big fan of making a salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another thing we were like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes like with this maybe if we cross
them it'll taste like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't usually work like that But like
it's still fun to do and salads for
[SPEAKER_04]: effect, especially if you know,
yeah Yeah, when you're like aware of what
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got like I used to have like a
little bag just full of like Half-eights
[SPEAKER_04]: of a bunch of different things and I
figure out like time of day like what was
[SPEAKER_04]: I gonna have?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, or if I had like a headache I'd
have something that was like a white widow
[SPEAKER_04]: cross, you know be like, oh, what's it
gonna be?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at these different things and
my friends would be like why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need these are friends who weren't
in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you need so many different kinds
and your little bag?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like because I don't know how I'm
gonna feel Yeah, I need I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: correlate this with how I feel because
everywhere I go show and tell that's right
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny because we do the salad so
like somebody will come over Shiloh came
[SPEAKER_01]: on the show We mixed it up with sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a salad with two strong Strong that
there was like turning it into Voltron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like from I love that from the cat
into the full on Voltron It got us
[SPEAKER_01]: laughing and I was crying on the show and
But yeah, we do when I see friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, yeah, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we should do salad I love those
where you're like you somebody's got this
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that let's see what happens when we
roll them together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it That's it or sometimes
like just like throwing in some different
[SPEAKER_04]: hash with it, too I love doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't the reason I don't smoke on
podcast is because I'll just stare at you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I Won't be much fun and you'll be
like why is she here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had that happen and I feel like I
just what I've learned over the last year
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half especially is that the guest if
they don't want to smoke it's not worth
[SPEAKER_01]: having them smoke because we've had some
episodes where they were uncomfortable or
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody wanted to smoke and I probably
shouldn't let him smoke so much You spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: like an ounce before the episode Luckily
we have great editors Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that note, we've got your husband
slash producer slash everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: coming on Jeff Jeff Pearson from further
and from many other bands.

it like being a producer?

route Michael Steele Michael was the head
[SPEAKER_00]: of the RNC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hates Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's kind of it's funny Let's dive into
talking about the Grateful Dead and Dead
[SPEAKER_01]: in Company because we were at the same
show I believe or you believe yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I took Sarah Sarah, you know Sarah and I
weren't together for The entire time I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah mostly because I was gone seven
months every year, but So she had never
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced a show so we that was my first
dead show we went to dead in company and
[SPEAKER_00]: of course we you know, because I know
everybody we went backstage and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out and Saw my buddy Bill Walton
and his beautiful wife Lori Incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: people super friendly hours so friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes John Mayer look short He makes
everybody look short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I was gonna say my favorite bill
story is one of my You know, my main band
[SPEAKER_00]: is called box set but I had another kind
of band for a while that I just a big rock
[SPEAKER_00]: band called the fall risk and We got asked
to do the national anthem at a warrior
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockets game one night and so I go and
this is when Bill's son Luke was a bench
[SPEAKER_00]: coach for the Warriors and so Bill was
there and you know, we knew each other
[SPEAKER_00]: because he said every further show
practically and I jokingly said hey Bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: why don't you sit in on the anthem
tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, I'll do it,
you know Wow, so I went to the Warriors
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well Hey, what if we get Walton up on
the anthem sign?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all like, well, can you sing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no mic stand that's seven feet
tall The mic will be in front of me and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other guys and he'll be in the back,
you know, and they said great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it So we did it and then ended up
on the lead-in for Sports Center that
[SPEAKER_00]: night, you know, it was just a kick in the
butt It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: God rest his soul Yeah, I mean that show
at Shoreline I had been starving myself
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had bet my friend a thousand
dollars that I could lose more weight than
[SPEAKER_01]: him in a month and it was like on maybe
the 12th or 13th at Shoreline two years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm and we were the The weigh-in was on
the 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like I went to the gym in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I wasn't eating carbs I was eating
like chicken and asparagus and so I was
[SPEAKER_01]: basically I wasn't fasted but I was eating
very low calorie and drinking lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: water right and I popped a little
microdose and it gave me the macro dose
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and Bill's arms, you know,
if you've ever been to a show you see
[SPEAKER_01]: bills are even back and forth and Yeah,
the trails on Bill's arms were pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have Imagine they were you know,
it was a great set that was a great set,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know dead in company All the all the
Bay Area shows have been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm fun band very fun band Yeah,
great great group of guys to work with I
[SPEAKER_00]: bet incredible guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a great Like little six-year run
with further.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really a lot of stuff a lot
of things I can't talk about I bet What
[SPEAKER_01]: was the best what was the one if you think
of the The best experience that you had I
[SPEAKER_00]: think for me it was probably first time at
Madison Square Garden I had dreamed about
[SPEAKER_00]: playing there since I was a kid When I
used to hold the tennis racket pretend it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a guitar when I was like eight years
old Amazing and my group box said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know We we played a lot of big places
and but usually as the opener So to
[SPEAKER_00]: finally get there and be the headlining
act at Madison Square Garden was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I always remember And then
you know, like someplace like Radio City
[SPEAKER_00]: Music Hall Was obviously very exciting
first time I read rocks was great You know
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the absolutely iconic places and
then of course, you know, I'm a Bay Area
[SPEAKER_00]: guy So, you know playing shoreline and the
Coliseum and the Berkeley Greek those were
[SPEAKER_00]: all special because yeah I had played a
lot of them before but as not as the
[SPEAKER_00]: headliner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to all those venues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must be of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're all we're all from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah We know how special they are and yeah
And then the shoreline has that's that
[SPEAKER_04]: special connection with the dead and when
you're backstage you get to see some of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the stuff that Well, it was built
for the Grateful Dead Shoreline was
[SPEAKER_00]: literally built for the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're up in the air above it,
it's a steely It's really cool for those
[SPEAKER_00]: of you that don't know that yeah Yeah,
if you're above it if you ever fly over it
[SPEAKER_00]: look now and it's a still your face Yeah
shaped like that on purpose by Bill Graham
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty amazing pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was blessed But you know Bob used
to come see My band box set which is going
[SPEAKER_00]: into our 34th year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our 34th year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Bob used to come see box set all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah in the 90s So when they formed
further, you know, I got the call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like we all have our place on
this earth and it's amazing when you find
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're meant to do absolutely whether
it's music or podcasts or podcasts and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing You know, I just I love being a
part of this this bigger this bigger thing
[SPEAKER_01]: this collective consciousness that we're
all a part of and It makes me smile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and to meet other people that
have found what they're passionate about
[SPEAKER_01]: and able to Put the years in and the time
in and and have great stories Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, you know almost every
musician I've ever met and known
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciates cannabis people
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good thing for us to have We got
together people said it made perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what I used to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much weed around You know
further in the Grateful Dead when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with them and I thought that was a
lot of weed until I met Sarah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, everybody sends her
everything to check out try this I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out with this What do you think and
they want to get her approval?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally I got to the point where every
time we take an uber I tip them with some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cannabis product to get it out of
my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice That's always a you know,
I feel like a lot of times that's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: great tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially guys a lot of stoners,
especially in the Bay Area You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people either smoke or
have friends that smoke and even if they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't smoke But they take it, you know,
it's probably gonna go into some good
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people don't throw weed away No,
that's the beautiful thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always ask the driver I said are you in
the cannabis and inevitably 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time they're like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I get a nice bag of cookies,
but it yeah working as a as an educator
[SPEAKER_04]: and a consultant I get a lot of people who
want to get feedback on products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's it's I love checking
stuff out, but there's only You never
[SPEAKER_04]: think that it's a good problem to have I
know you have to Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean so like with with testing out flour
I've been in the habit of lighting up half
[SPEAKER_01]: joints like smoking a half a joint or not
rolling a half joint rolling a full joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I want to know how it burns past the
Initial part because you really got to get
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if it tastes good in the beginning
That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But halfway down if it still tastes good
then you're on to something Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I've seen your joints and
they're big Yeah, I like smoking good
[SPEAKER_01]: joints and I feel like that's the best way
to determine if it tastes good or not
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so a half a joint for you is
probably a full Yeah, yeah, yeah when we
[SPEAKER_00]: when on 420 that joint you had I was like,
okay, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah We got some more for you today
Yeah, I love I love the big joints I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: better than my thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah The party joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you know, I mean that's I think
that That's how I like to consider You
[SPEAKER_01]: know how I really enjoy the flavor and I
use thin papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah smart and You know you got I want
them to draw a good amount of smoke Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not a huge hash hole guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are into the hash holes
now and it's cool I'll smoke them every
[SPEAKER_01]: once in a while if somebody has them I'm
not I don't go out of my way to roll them
[SPEAKER_01]: or to buy them, but I get gifted some
amazing stuff But yeah, I just love real
[SPEAKER_01]: good quality flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it's just exciting Yeah,
it does me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you know, Sarah was just
talking about the famous comedian that
[SPEAKER_00]: liked catatonic Yeah, I'm kind of that guy
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cuz you know when I was smoking
everything in California was outdoor It
[SPEAKER_00]: had a high amount of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it balanced everything out And so the
stuff today kind of makes me a little
[SPEAKER_00]: shaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm kind of a catatonic guy,
too I only smoke what she tells me I can
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's a grower up north Tina
Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah from moving made farms who was just
Everything she and it's outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's sun grown and everything
she does Is really good for my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried huckleberry hill farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're just getting ready to go
visit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're getting ready to go visit
Johnny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she just stopped a ridgeline Yeah,
stop a ridgeline on the way up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean Those guys have some
specials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the head over there looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the huckleberry hill farms that White
thorn rose is something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and After you smoke that I should
have some blue 13 done and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke and compare and contrast I would
love to I feel like the effect it's
[SPEAKER_01]: feel-good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you feel good You can smoke it in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke it at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke it when you're depressed You
can smoke it when you're happy and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good Yeah, and there's there's
nothing wrong with that and I feel like we
[SPEAKER_01]: need more weed like that We need to go
back into breathing for effect a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we've gone Into flavor and
you know I'm to blame for that too where
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been breeding for flavor heavy on
flavor and then Kind of neglecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect part because I feel like the effect
is tied in heavily with the flavors that I
[SPEAKER_01]: like Yeah, but in all honesty,
I need to go back to breeding for effect
[SPEAKER_01]: and Especially that feel-good stuff where
it's like it makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I can breed it and I can smoke
it That's what I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got to taste good, too Of
course still got to check the boxes but
[SPEAKER_01]: that Feel-good effect is Something that we
all need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I feel like that's that's
the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the real, you know, that's the
magic The magic is found there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do still enjoy that dry hit before
you light it up though Really like
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing that I might dry hit him like
a couple hours before and then like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I might dry hit him 20 or 30
times sometimes or Sometimes if I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to smoke in the car on the way home
So as far as strains you guys like to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke together What is something that
works for both you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably kind of tonic just cuz or no,
you know what cherry moon cherry moon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, Tina Gordon again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah cherry moon Moon made farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, is it a CBD strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it isn't but it's like it's it's
moderate THC with a really nice like I
[SPEAKER_04]: feel like it just has a really balanced
profile to it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like He has a couple pups.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's totally happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smoke it and I feel something That's
you know, we I tend to like things that
[SPEAKER_04]: are a little bit stronger He's he's the
example But yeah when I teach my classes
[SPEAKER_04]: and people are asking about dosage and I'm
like, okay So body mass has nothing to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like My husband who is almost twice my
size is my two hit wonder Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have a high tolerance and it has to
do with what's going on with your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's amazing how that works alcohol
is the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some women they can drink men under
the table Oh when I back in the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been I've always had female
friends, but I've always had a lot of guy
[SPEAKER_04]: friends And so, you know you keep up and
I'm a bourbon drinker if or wine if I
[SPEAKER_04]: drink I don't drink that much anymore But
back in the day I can hold my own for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's either bourbon or wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah bourbon or wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have everything Yeah, we have
everything to accommodate our guests,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're bourbon and wine I got a whole
bar at the house and i'm not drinking
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so How does that feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look down there and i'm like,
it looks interesting but Doesn't interest
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah right now And I like entertaining
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always one of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love having my friends over for dinner
And I also like making cocktails and food
[SPEAKER_01]: and rolling joints And doing dabs and I
got a set of hot knives i'm waiting to try
[SPEAKER_01]: on some friends So I just found and i'm
like, yeah, we're gonna try these on
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody Someone's coming over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some hot knife hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe my friend ru will see Um Are you the
cook in the family?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am but He said he was a chef.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I remember that but just because
you're a chef doesn't mean you cook at
[SPEAKER_01]: home I'm really picky about what I eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I eat mostly protein I'm on a low
carb high fat high protein diet Uh-huh,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I I get away with not eating very much
But uh, yeah and like smoking weed will
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely make me more hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But yeah when I have friends over
like I have all kinds of cool stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: like stuff from the past that people
haven't seen in 20 years like before the
[SPEAKER_01]: volcano there was a vaporizer that you it
would have a glass glass piece with the
[SPEAKER_01]: hose on it and you would have an element
and you would blow hot hot air through the
[SPEAKER_01]: element and That was the that's how we
vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh was it that little wooden box wooden
box?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: My roommate broke mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really pissed at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, and like if you break it now,
there's no like the company doesn't exist
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore I don't know how to get the
replacement pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to have someone hand blow you
the replacement piece but there was the
[SPEAKER_01]: big buddha vaporizer and there there was a
whole bunch of cool stuff and I have all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of nostalgia from 20 years ago 25
years ago from when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that, you know, the only thing I
haven't done in a long time was use a
[SPEAKER_01]: magnifying glass to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did that back in the day and I'm
probably going to do that again this
[SPEAKER_00]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a toilet paper roll or an apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dorms we used to do that out of
desperation sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always the Bong MacGyver.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got to get creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some wild things for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know what you guys are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done that at cannabis conferences
where they don't allow weed in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get an apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instabong.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you guys put a fabric softener in the
cardboard tubes and like blow your hits
[SPEAKER_01]: into that when you're younger?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the dorms.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the dorms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put some bounce in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't get caught.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kill the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You blow it right through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we just used to stick the towels under
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we did that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dorm was on the 14th floor of San
Francisco State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were up high and we just opened the
window and blew out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was right by the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I don't think anybody cared
at San Francisco State.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not San.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Northern Michigan University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they cared there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go to jail for resin in your pipe
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny because now Northern
Michigan University wants you to come and
[SPEAKER_00]: be an Edgerton professor and teach a
cannabis class.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be starting a bachelor's
program in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these colleges need to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to educate people on how to work
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think all these things are a
great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to my experience with
culinary school, I feel like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people went to culinary school.
[SPEAKER_01]: They paid $100,000 for school and then
ended up working at Starbucks because you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get the industry experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like cannabis is the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to work in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to be a breeder or you
want to ... I think cannabis is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to go to college for plant
science, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as learning the basic stuff,
you should actually just go get a job at a
[SPEAKER_01]: farm, indoor, outdoor, greenhouse,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best way to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want a job in the industry,
you want to be professionals, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do, besides growing in your
closet at home, which is great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but go out and get a job in the industry,
suck it up for five years, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay, but you're going to learn
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that's ... Whether you're a
musician or whatever it is, doing it is
[SPEAKER_00]: how you are going to learn how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Musician, we didn't make any money the
first five or six years either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting that you're talking about
culinary school and then this,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that was one of the things ... I
was going to go to culinary school for
[SPEAKER_04]: pastry and I was doing a lot of reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was that big argument about,
do you just work under someone or do you
[SPEAKER_04]: go to school?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had applied to school.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I saw the loan that I was
going to take out and that I was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be lucky if I made 13 bucks an hour in a
kitchen, when I got done, I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, how do you get people to get excited
about actually doing the time in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, just working their way up?
[SPEAKER_04]: But also when we're looking at education,
some of these programs that are out and I
[SPEAKER_04]: know people who have gone, I ask them,
I say, are you doing it for the
[SPEAKER_04]: institutionalization or are you actually
learning something from it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they've been in the industry,
it's the institutionalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second question I always ask
is, are your professors people who
[SPEAKER_04]: actually have practical experience or are
these tenured professors with advanced
[SPEAKER_04]: degrees that are teaching the curriculum
that's given to them?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's usually the second as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think if we are going to be
having these programs, we need to make it
[SPEAKER_04]: attractive for people in the industry to
work in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But more than that, there has to be
critical thought in the educational
[SPEAKER_04]: institution that it's not necessarily
going to be a person with a master's
[SPEAKER_04]: degree that's going to be teaching this
class.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're going to have the knowledge in
the background to help create the
[SPEAKER_04]: curriculum, actually put people out there
and know what they're doing and can get
[SPEAKER_04]: good jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, at the end of the day,
if I'm learning how to, if I want to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: school for breeding, I want to know from
somebody who actually does breed how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, what's their approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's cause you can do the plant science
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the basics, it's great to go to
school for foundational stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the fundamentals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to learn the fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes down to cannabis and
learning how to breed, everyone has their
[SPEAKER_01]: own way of doing it and learning
somebody's style, learning their approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we all have different approaches
that, that helps you find your own way
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you really want to do is
find your own way to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can do that by practicing at home,
but doing that at scale is so much
[SPEAKER_01]: different than breeding in a tent,
you know, or breeding under, under four
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're breeding under 60 lights,
doing phenol hunting under 60 lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to four, that's a whole
different story, you know, and you're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to explore a lot more or doing a whole
field, you know, and usually you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do that on your own dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better to go learn on somebody else's
dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go lose some, not lose some money,
but not make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go work in Humboldt on a farm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and you may find that as much as you
thought that that's what you wanted to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's something else in the cannabis
sphere that you, that you weren't even
[SPEAKER_04]: turned on to before that you actually want
to do instead.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you created the curriculum for city
college, San Francisco, the first
[SPEAKER_00]: curriculum, the first group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a very interesting time because
it was very political to be able to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was, the faculty were not as open to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was, I was interesting because I
wasn't a faculty that was an employee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to kind of see some of the
politics, but not, but be removed from it
[SPEAKER_04]: was a blessing, but it was, I was grateful
to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, I did three, three hour classes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a session.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a whole session.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when the next group of people
came in and did the classes, I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: was easier for them to be able to get
through some of the politics and really
[SPEAKER_04]: like be able to have the freedom to put in
some really good curriculum as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always got to start somewhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self, and we're going to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: one at a time, what would that one piece
of advice be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many times as a struggling
musician in the early days where I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, you know, and you're not both my
parents, but one of my parents is always
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of breathing down my neck,
you know, join the apprenticeship,
[SPEAKER_00]: have something to fall back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I would have done that,
I don't think I would have had a career in
[SPEAKER_00]: music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't lose hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick to your guns.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine would be just staying true to
yourself, especially when you're younger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you doubt things and you get
really influenced by, there are good
[SPEAKER_04]: influences, of course, that help shape our
personalities.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think as human beings, we're given
this laundry list of things that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to do and be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it promises us this successful,
happy life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not everybody has the same path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be true to yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick to your gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
