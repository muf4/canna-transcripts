[SPEAKER_04]: Hundreds of... Did I knock it out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut!
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost started a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my guest is Brian from Vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, thank you for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've known each other for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've dropped soil off of my house
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the business and the trust
and confidence in using my product,
[SPEAKER_04]: something on your level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you have a great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really, really good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys stand behind your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your soil product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've always given me awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: 17 years deep now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you guys start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go back and give us a
little history lesson on maybe even before
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you start with the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you the quick rundown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Industry-wise, cannabis found me at a
pretty young age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt drawn to it at a young age.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I realized that it was also a way to
really link with other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good common ground to meet people
that may not be from your exact same
[SPEAKER_04]: demographic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just be able to open up your friends
circle on a huge scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one thing that unites us all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like food does for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have all these different
backgrounds of people that they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: normally be friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the plant, we're all
connected in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed that even at a young age,
in high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all schools are similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up middle class, Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much good weed ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was Mexican.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was weed, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like this weed or that weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely helped connect with
different neighborhoods and different
[SPEAKER_04]: types of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the football players, to the
burnouts, to the smart kids, to the jocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were smoking in the 80s?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: 82, 83.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like 10 years after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like it was a little bit of a
different scene after.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 90s compared to the 80s from what
I've heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the 90s was more of the BC weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they were starting to get some
California and some homegrown weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think a lot of the California
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from California too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably never saw Mexican
brickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Mexican brickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to get pounds of it for,
it was like $400 a pound or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would get you really high and
sometimes you'd have a joint and it would
[SPEAKER_01]: pop seeds out of the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You forget to take them all out or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the stuff was seeded,
but some of it was green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it wasn't brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to break it apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't start to see the better Mexican
weed until I was more in college.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I finally started seeing,
I'd say by like 88, 89 on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd occasionally go to a dead show in a
different area and be able to get a bag of
[SPEAKER_04]: weed that was amazing and try to just hold
onto that as long as I could because that
[SPEAKER_04]: was the only access to really high grade
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear every guest is interconnected with
the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not by selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I think Grateful Dead cannabis
very highly tied together.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially us older statesmen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's face it, ChemDog, that happened
because of a Grateful Dead concert.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many different growers would take
their craft weed and go hustle that on the
[SPEAKER_04]: dead lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of the open market then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before that, I didn't know of even
good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it opened my eyes to see what the
possibilities were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just... What kind of genetics
do you remember any of the strain names?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that strain names are like any... I
remember just smoking real blueberry bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in like 87, 88.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more of like a sativa, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was definitely a sativa for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first experience with any sort of
blueberry was a sativa plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the first things I grew
at my house when I got eight lights in
[SPEAKER_01]: with my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were from Oregon and it doubled
in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were growing up into the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I didn't really know what
I was doing, but we were figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember buying bags of weed of
this blueberry and then always been on the
[SPEAKER_04]: lookout for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And occasionally I would, I think once or
twice really only is all that I ever got
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that was the only time I
really saw the true DJ short blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just recently got the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So DJ shorts is a short plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: His is a very short plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's blueberry, but the one from
Oregon... So you don't think it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be the one that I've been having in my
memory?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be, maybe I'm wrong, but the one
I remember is very different than DJ
[SPEAKER_01]: shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was so excited to grow DJ shorts
and I grew it and I was like, got a
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that it was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just so different that it was a
letdown for me because I was expecting
[SPEAKER_01]: this sativa plant that doubles in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has these crazy frosty nugs and it
didn't have the same profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was blueberry, but like the one from
Oregon was like this crazy, not fuely
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, but it was like really complex
and down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could roll joints of it and you would
want to smoke it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pick the roaches up the next
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was that and it was from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the plant, I got it from
somebody who says, this is the DJ short
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if you had the
experience, but the leaves are super
[SPEAKER_04]: serrated almost to the point where the
serration goes inconsistent because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: such a severe serration.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost just blends together almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also even some
variegation in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious to see how it's going to
come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to just try it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go into Vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you start Vital?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a grower and I was always leaning to
the organic side of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew a lot of my own vegetables and
wanted to have a clean organic product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day I thought I was using an
organic product and I read the label and I
[SPEAKER_04]: realized that there were some ingredients
in there that probably weren't organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So long story short, I started just
looking more and more at labels and
[SPEAKER_04]: realizing that there's a lot of crappy
products out there that have this visual
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal that may tend to think that the
grower who's looking at it would think
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was organic, whether it's the name
or however they twist something in your
[SPEAKER_04]: head.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it started to bother me and I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is something I need to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And around the same time you brought up
earlier Israel, he's a good old friend of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine and he was living up in Oregon and
they were having similar issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were all comparing notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those guys started a company up in
Oregon at the same time, relatively.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also had a landscaping license.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I basically built my store and my
manufacturing company off of originally
[SPEAKER_04]: just getting that landscaping license,
a state contractor's license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my company was called Vital
Landscaping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, long story short, those guys up
there there was a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a little bit more capital put
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were a little bit faster putting
some products out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we distributed their products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would make products that would
be kind of like a companion to some of
[SPEAKER_04]: their products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like their first products was they had
a potting soil and then they had to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: in a bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my first product was a it was a
cumic acid, which is baseline and still
[SPEAKER_04]: one of our leading selling products.
[SPEAKER_04]: A liquid and a dry version.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next product was fish because
we were big on the whole compost tea
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting compost and worm castings and
putting them into water and adding a few
[SPEAKER_04]: things and mixing some oxygen into there
and trying to see what came of it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: how it started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we kind of learned about Elaine
Ingham and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically 2006 actually officially
opened doors of Vital Garden Supply and
[SPEAKER_04]: started distributing a couple of those
products from Oregon, the Vital Earth
[SPEAKER_04]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was Vital Earth and you were
Vital Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like they called me one day
and they're like, I got a great idea
[SPEAKER_04]: because I was already Vital Landscaping
and I and I was opening the store as Vital
[SPEAKER_04]: Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, we'll be Vital Earth and
you'll be our distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like and I was like, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, looking back on it, you know,
it definitely created a little confusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, we were all family and
friends and we represented them as it was
[SPEAKER_04]: our own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like we were the California,
you know, hub for them because being in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon and shipping and all that,
it didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they were caught up in
Oregon building their companies and lives
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iz has gone on to do all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's down in Columbia right now with Vital
Earth down there and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Phytonics, they did, you know,
he's done genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk very often.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still very close.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually been down to Columbia with
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a project in Columbia that didn't
all the way pan out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we went down there together and we're
checking it out in the early days,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably like five years ago, almost six.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just starting down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's finally now starting to click
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually when I met him was about
five years ago in Columbia at a
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see we have mutual friends and we all
went to dinner and it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, really good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, super good guy for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's him and his wife are like super close
friends with me and my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we are close.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping to retire and grow old
together somewhere together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia is not a bad way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I feel like, yeah, tropical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia is tropical too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Columbia is tropical.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where he definitely wants to have a
place there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure all the way committed to like
being the third world all the way,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I can definitely spend some time
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a beautiful country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the cost of living down there is
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food is so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fresh and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uber was $2 the most anywhere when I was
in Bogota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go anywhere in the city and the city
is 10 San Francisco's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just blown away because I would
take Uber, but then you have to sit in the
[SPEAKER_01]: front seat because Uber is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the taxi driver, you have to make it
look like you're friends with the Uber
[SPEAKER_01]: driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So otherwise you might get left on the
side of the road and the guy you might get
[SPEAKER_01]: arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, good experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually working with a group down
there who's got an American partner up
[SPEAKER_04]: here to get all of our products registered
because they're a certified organic
[SPEAKER_04]: facility already and they're struggling
getting products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working hand in hand with them in
the ICA, which is Columbia Department of
[SPEAKER_04]: Ag, to get all the vital products
registered down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully within the next six months or so
they'll be available too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Open our horizons a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're really interested in
cannabis, agriculture, all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of people that are
pushing the organics down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like the people are super
conscious of what they use and what they
[SPEAKER_04]: put on the planet and they care about
their land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting all these different
places we're expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look at Portugal right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal's going full bore for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have a friend who just left
yesterday to go work over there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they got 40 acres, 40 acres,
full term, which I saw the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you hear about stuff and that's
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 acres is quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not compared to the United States
really, but still, I mean, 40 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it is one plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 acres is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty amazing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to visit that someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can arrange that anytime for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's all over the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking about South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about, you know,
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand's making a big push.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just read the, is the prime minister,
he's not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that same article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it seems like it's doing it for
their economy a little late.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little late to make that call.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the planet for sure between what's
already happening in the economy and just
[SPEAKER_04]: like between technology and all the just
craziness and then cannabis being okay in
[SPEAKER_04]: this community, but not this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's not like even in our own
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just a strange thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in strange times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and for it to be like something that,
you know, that's going to be legal for the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole country is I'd like to see it
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and like see California, you know,
cannabis companies be able to thrive a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit better and open their doors to
like national, but I, it just seems like
[SPEAKER_04]: such a long, far off thing to me because
no one's roles are even close to the same
[SPEAKER_04]: in the same state, let alone the same
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how crazy testing is all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just within one state, you know,
as far as, I mean, we're so off base with
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of stuff, but it seems so far away,
but it's so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is closer than it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in 1996, it was like, I knew it
was going to happen in our lifetimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's looking like it's really
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it, but it's still like,
as soon as we think it's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we'll have a bunch of setbacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to see what goes on with this
potential rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I feel like it's, it's a constant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a fan of the whole reschedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to deschedule, not reschedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense to consider it a
schedule three drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, in my opinion, that's silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just kind of complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, this is, this goes back to what I
was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how are we as one nation going to
even be able to agree upon one set of
[SPEAKER_04]: rules?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, that's a terrible route
because all these people who are already
[SPEAKER_04]: like way invested are basically going to
have to throw away their infrastructure
[SPEAKER_04]: and start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to start scheduling
tobacco and alcohol to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're schedule three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're in very strange times because
we're in, you know, it's hard to say
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to happen next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's amazing we're at where
we're, where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing that we've gotten here so
quickly in some ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scary at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's advanced, you know,
I mean, look at cultivation and the
[SPEAKER_01]: advances in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made huge differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even big greenhouses and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually at a facility in
Watsonville and they were partners with a
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetable farm like on the same property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they share equipment and they just got
this robotic AI tractor that needs no
[SPEAKER_04]: human.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it could do anything from vacuum bugs
off of plants to spray them.
[SPEAKER_04]: To harvest them.
[SPEAKER_04]: To plant them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: With people that you and I both know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have infrared now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can detect, they can detect ethylene
in the plants, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can have infrared sensors and
they'll know if a plant's going to express
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex traits, herm basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, and this is just the
infancy of all this stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all, you know, we're just starting to
get AI involved with stuff and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a blessing and a curse,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day I feel like something new is
like showing its face and I just shake my
[SPEAKER_04]: head every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, holy crap, we can do this now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some ways, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other ways, I feel like it's speeding
things up too fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of even just how they like made
all these rules is like, they made rules
[SPEAKER_04]: without thinking of scaling or without
thinking of how it might be when we're
[SPEAKER_04]: connected to the state next to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or there's just so much like not well
thought out-ness, if that's a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen mitigation was never a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you hear it more and more,
like, especially in like Salinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at a facility last, not this week,
but the last, my last trip down there and
[SPEAKER_04]: they were like, they know that there's a
facility next to them that's doing some
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding and they saw lights on at a
certain hour and they're like starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: like worry and they're like, I know you
have males in there and it's creating
[SPEAKER_04]: anxiety and it's like... That will create
anxiety for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's one thing having one male,
but if you're making acres of seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, you know,
it's like you're affecting the people
[SPEAKER_01]: around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can make them in the off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: What people don't understand is seed
production can be done in the off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor production is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for consistency, because if
you're making seeds and your neighbor's
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds, they're going to get
cross-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Open pollination on large scale acreage is
scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are delivering soil all over
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil, fertilizer and newts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some things make more sense to
ship far than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other hand, like we're shipping
soil as far as like Michigan and New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's less than more.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually need strategic partners in
some of those other states to help us like
[SPEAKER_04]: have product on the ground there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my pushes for this winter
and spring is to try to just have more
[SPEAKER_04]: availability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like so many people seem to like
reach out to us and say, we want to try
[SPEAKER_04]: your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to buy a bag of our soil is super
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to ship it is like 50 bucks.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it could like quadruple the cost of a
bag of soil just by like giving it to the
[SPEAKER_04]: postman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one thing that's always been a
struggle with like moving soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: worm castings, compost, humus,
these heavy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuffed blueprints.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving things around is hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Liquids are a little bit easier,
but still heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we now have some dry soluble powders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have kelp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have smaller sizes for the home
gardeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our web business has definitely picked
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do need to figure out a way to get
products to, you know, further out less
[SPEAKER_04]: expensively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's a trick in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the home growers and living
soil, no till living soil, organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think there's been a big push
more so lately in the last year than I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's pushes in every direction
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I've seen a lot of guys,
you know, it's a hot topic right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you brought this up, because I
agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this year compared to last
year, there's a resurgence for like people
[SPEAKER_04]: who really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the last two years, not this
2023, but 21 and two, was the years of
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody like scaling back, trying to
figure out the cheapest way to grow as
[SPEAKER_04]: much as they can and cut their costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what really suffered is the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what really suffered suffered is the
smokers at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's a lot of really crappy
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't want to point any
fingers at any specific names,
[SPEAKER_04]: but some of these- Most of it's crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, most of it's,
I don't know about crap, but most of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: not a great product, not the type of
product that I enjoy consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a consumer, I want to smoke
something that tastes good, that gives me
[SPEAKER_01]: an amazing high.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the effect is important,
but the taste is also important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, you know, like we've been smoking
this stuff so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets you high, of course, but the
experience, the flavor, your mouth getting
[SPEAKER_04]: coated with the terpenes and the smoke.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're looking for,
is something to be like, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like we want that experience,
that wow mark, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I was saying earlier,
organic and well-grown weed is so much
[SPEAKER_04]: different than a nutrient company that's
just trying to tell you to increase your
[SPEAKER_04]: PPMs and push it, push it, push it,
push it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that created was like a whole
upset in our entire industry where like,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, like people were trying to,
they'd rather get it from their friend or
[SPEAKER_04]: their next door neighbor because they
would, they would have an experience where
[SPEAKER_04]: they would go buy some weed at a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may even have been a brand that
they trusted before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because that brand had to cut corners
because it cost a lot to produce and the
[SPEAKER_04]: state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even want to blame that brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't blame them at all because
it's just to survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is where status quo right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those people who went to the
dispensary and bought some weed and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: just like, not that great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, dang, 70 bucks for this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tastes like cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I think there's three types of
consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the social smoker that really
doesn't care one way or the other about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just smoke socially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's the flavor chasers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the dragon chasers that
chase the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like those are the three types
of consumers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of guys that care about getting
high, that's really the main focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it tastes good, that's a bonus,
but they want stuff that's super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of guys smoke extract too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those guys have gone on to smoke
an extract because flower definitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of it has a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although now we're getting back into those
like infused products, sativas that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about some of these,
you know, the pith is coming back and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hazes, you know, it's like, they're
definitely making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting because I think most
people in the other two categories,
[SPEAKER_01]: besides chasing the flavors, would
appreciate the flavor if they get to taste
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of stuff that we get to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think most people would
appreciate it because it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoke something that tastes
amazing, it's like, oh, that's all I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to turn back.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't want to turn back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once you smoke it for a little while,
then it's like you smoke everything else
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just not as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's why I think right now is a
good time for all of the cannabis brands
[SPEAKER_04]: and the growers to like shine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because we kind of went through this
period where like, OK, dispensaries were
[SPEAKER_04]: just like this such a novelty where just
the fact that you could go in there and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually go buy weed products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just like a mind blowing
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that people are kind of like used
to that part, they want to have an
[SPEAKER_04]: experience that where they like enjoy what
they're buying and they're actually like
[SPEAKER_04]: happy with their purchase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, the consumer is getting
more educated, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's I think it's the growers job to
put something in their hand that's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to change the way that they look at every
time they make that purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like what you said about educated
consumer, because I feel like California
[SPEAKER_01]: is a little behind as a whole because
legalization happened earlier in other
[SPEAKER_01]: states, Washington, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I I see it up in Washington
that they're able to not just sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: high THC stuff, they can still sell stuff
that not quite as high THC and they go on
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that they trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's happening more and more
in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting to shift back to that,
where the dispensary isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: making the rule or it has to test 30
percent or you're not bringing it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think that mentality has gotten
a little bit evolved where people are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when it has to, because I feel
like some of the best stuff doesn't test
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best flavor profiles that I
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I rarely test like in the in the places
where some of them just shoot up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love good gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess is making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually you hear people talking about
a year later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a big thing for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gas will be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG is going to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it won't be SFV or the Josh Dio or
the Tahoe or the Diablo or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be these crosses that are
coming out that are really heavy in the
[SPEAKER_01]: gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then purple with gas where it's like
real strong gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen a bunch of it,
but it's it's going to get even even
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to take that those Josh
D's and combine them with some crazy,
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That original.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the part about where we are in
this industry that is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because like people like yourselves
are making like amazing strains and just
[SPEAKER_04]: like opening up, you know, terpene
profiles that have never been,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, exposed because of combining
things that, you know, that's part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fun of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, of the feno hunting
process, the selection process is going
[SPEAKER_01]: through and finding stuff you've never
seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had fried chicken up in Washington for
Jason up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to House of Cultivar with
the fried chicken feno.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a really good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good guy for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just good people.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember early days going up there and
meeting them and talking to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they even came down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you know Gordon from Grass Valley?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good friend, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He crushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does he have something to do with those
guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: So him and I and Jason work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've made some crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some reversals up there with Jason
and we made some we've made a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gordon's made a bunch of genetics on
his own in Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some really awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's just he's another guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Gordon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy and friend and so just a
very likable person and someone who loves
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the people I gravitate to now,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people love the plant, you know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just obvious, typically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people that can't stop talking about
it and talking about flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just you know, I think it's one of
those things like I'm here because I love
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there's struggles along with it,
but I feel like that's part of life's
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if it was easy, everyone would do
it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some of the struggles that we're
all faced with feel like they there's
[SPEAKER_04]: enough other ones that these ones
shouldn't be in the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which to me is like the regulation
type stuff and the ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, things that they make us go
through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other hand, the rest of it is
part of the as you know, the harder the
[SPEAKER_04]: struggle, the sweeter the victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think you don't want an easy
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a you know, it's it's
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost you want you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want your kids to struggle or
you don't want to, you know, your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want your family to struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think struggle defines helps define
who you are and what you're capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: overcoming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you never have a struggle,
then it's hard to learn anything because
[SPEAKER_01]: like when there's no contrast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you're really successful,
you don't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the sour and the sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of need both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you fail and you learn a lot if
you fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these last three to five years just
in selling like soil and fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_04]: just dealing with growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we've had to completely
evolve how like we communicate and like
[SPEAKER_04]: help farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like one of the things when when I
first started all my products,
[SPEAKER_04]: the first thing I did, you know,
when I was testing them before I would
[SPEAKER_04]: even like bring them to market,
it was to see how much you could actually
[SPEAKER_04]: use without burning the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you basically want to like come up
with your application rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone was worried.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to go over the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to tell people to use too
much and burn their plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's more like, well, how little
can we use and still get recommended to
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody feel good about their what their
outcome is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the point where we know they're going
to keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had to like completely like
figure out a way for them to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: use our products on a less expensive
basis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you got to know how to
pivot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have to work harder and longer
and go further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To get the sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, you got to like make sure that the
grower understands how to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you may have to present something to
the finance department just to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're going to approve the sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, there's like
all these different layers and it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: like turned into like all the I feel like
we're always quoting against somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, they need to
look at what we could do for you as a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole instead of just like what the cost
for this bottle of whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's so competitive in soil and
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like if you look at there's so
many seed companies out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: what makes you stand out compared to any
other seed company or me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what am I doing different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really think hard all the time
about like, how can we improve our
[SPEAKER_01]: product?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we make better genetics using
tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents making sure our genetics are clean
before we even start making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, that's a part of our
goal, you know, is like to be able to give
[SPEAKER_01]: people the best product possible and not
just so we can get the sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we feel good about what
we're doing as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm in for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like this is the first year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to get people introduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to keep them if you're still
around on the nipple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still in the industry,
I think at this point, you're in it for
[SPEAKER_01]: the long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's hard work and it's
it's enjoyable work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you love if you love doing it,
it's actually fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and all the driving around.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this last week I did this little
like firstly did this event in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, in northern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Arcata is like from Nevada City,
like a six hour drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the way up the top, almost to the
top of the 101 before we get to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did a three day event there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to see a lot of old friends,
people, you know, people I've known since
[SPEAKER_04]: I was 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was cool to connect and see,
see, you know, everyone's kind of in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's better than it was last year,
but it sure could be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're glad to see you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if we're here, then,
you know, that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and then we rolled all the way down
and did I first I stopped in Salinas and
[SPEAKER_04]: had a, you know, a little consultation
down there and did a walk through at
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Reserve and checked out their
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're growing all the massive
genetics because he's now part of that
[SPEAKER_04]: whole conglomerate now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did a nice feno hunt there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And amazing stuff's going to come out from
that.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy's gone big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not messing around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was one of the original founders there
and I'm a shareholder now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely a bigger company now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also one of Vitals,
you know, best customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've stayed really true to keeping
it organic and doing a really good job
[SPEAKER_04]: with their their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then after bouncing from Salinas,
we did this event in Ventura, which wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the National Heirloom Seed Expo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was like vegetable seed,
you know, fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that whole seed mentality
is the type of people that we are,
[SPEAKER_04]: like all those people that are looking out
for the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they really care about what they're
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, so we got to talk to passionate
farmers, passionate gardeners and growers,
[SPEAKER_04]: people making seeds, people buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, I feel like
there is a really big movement towards
[SPEAKER_04]: people getting back to the land,
growing a little bit more of their own
[SPEAKER_04]: food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, sure, technology is coming into
play, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think people still have that craving
to have a connection to the earth and grow
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, house plants are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, growing food is
very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's my therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if I don't have a garden,
I feel like I'd be like, I wouldn't know
[SPEAKER_04]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, what should I be doing right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, let's say you don't want to grow
tomatoes or you don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still grow herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still grow herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many little things that you can
do that you can eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not too late right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's always stuff that can be
grown that you can consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have a little plant of chives in
your window to, you know, a tomato plant
[SPEAKER_04]: under a grow light if you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, yeah, now they make these LEDs
that go and, you know, you can put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: your window or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I assume people have these
little grow tents with a veggie garden in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their cannabis garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have like food and I think that's
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good for families, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you live in a city and you want
your kids to be exposed to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking if you live in like a big
city right now, there's such a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: disconnection with like natural world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's better than making your
kids trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think I think it's a good
family experience for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a great way to teach your
kids about produce and about vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: and also to be able to taste the
difference between stuff that you grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff you buy in the store, because I
think most people have never experienced
[SPEAKER_01]: like, OK, well, yeah, I wouldn't say most
people, but there's a small percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: us that have grown a lot of stuff and then
a lot of people, they've only eaten store
[SPEAKER_01]: bought vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between a store bought
tomato and a homegrown tomato,
[SPEAKER_01]: even the heirloom in the stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aren't nearly as good as if you got
heirlooms yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you go to Berkeley Bowl,
you might find some good stuff during the
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, there's some great farms that put
out some good produce, but you got to like
[SPEAKER_04]: nail it in that perfect window.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been trucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows how many people put their grimy
hands on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing like that experience of
going and picking something ripe and
[SPEAKER_04]: carrying it into your kitchen,
cutting it up and eating it or putting it
[SPEAKER_04]: on a sandwich or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's so many places you can buy
exotic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you don't have to just grow a
plain cucumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of places sell different
cucumbers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we talk about pumpkins, cucumbers,
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's multiple varieties that
you could buy seeds of at the very least
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even cucumbers now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew a bunch this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love those little lemon cucumbers and
those Armenian ones that are long.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Armenian ones are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those things never get bitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be like three feet long and
still bitter and sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And still sweet, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they love the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things crush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are good up in Grass Valley for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with different lettuces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think different lettuces during the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different things and it's
like that you couldn't even get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: store if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lettuce is my favorite thing of
anything to grow in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my favorite because it's a
short crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's it doesn't even need fertilized
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you just as long as you have
some like rich soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's it grows such a short period of
time that it doesn't need fertilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that is something of all the
things that you could grow yourself and
[SPEAKER_04]: notice the difference between store bought
like fresh lettuce.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you cut it, wash it, eat it compared
to like sitting at least if you sit in a
[SPEAKER_04]: store, it's at least five days from being
cut.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least at least that's like probably
a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like Santa Cruz or something where
it's getting, you know, coming from
[SPEAKER_04]: Watsonville.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like most people throughout the
country, at least a week or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's if it's in a sealed bag,
a week or two, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like growing your own lettuce,
harvesting that and eating it is like one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the most rewarding things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done microgreens in a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I experimented a long time ago,
but my buddy is crushing garden house
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing microgreens now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy makes the best microgreens and
they're super.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and same thing with arugula,
too, like arugula.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get you get it from the store and it
just tastes green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it tastes plain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you get some really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a strong pepper flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love arugula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to eat more of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arugula is actually another super it's
even shorter than lettuce.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like 30 days you're like got
baby arugula.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the best when it's small,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, microgreens 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love microgreens.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can set that up under
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super easy to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get those little prop trays and get a
little baker's rack in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need much, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're super.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like as far as nutrient dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, like they're super amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you buy if not to just pitch my
soil, but if you grew microgreens in my
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, you definitely don't need to
fertilize it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like my soil is tons of
fertilizer, but it's rich because it has
[SPEAKER_04]: worm castings, compost, humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like got minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be, you know,
nurture your plant, but it's also going to
[SPEAKER_04]: put out some like tasty mineral rich food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's funny, if you grew microgreens in
all the different soils, they would with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same seed, they would all taste
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that's a great experiment someone
should do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys travel all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: for events.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about are you doing international
stuff soon?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit like this Columbia thing
is starting to pop into place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little tricky getting product out
of the country because of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Ag regulations and
especially the nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm sure salt based fertilizers are
probably easy to ship because they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: so worried about microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with organic stuff and just they're
super paranoia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of like microorganisms that are going to
like go into some country and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, wreak havoc on some crop or
people or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like that paranoia of of just
germs in general, like there's bacteria
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're scared of bacteria, then you
shouldn't walk outside your door because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's floating all around everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, when you tell
someone that you have bacteria or fungi in
[SPEAKER_04]: a bag in a bag or a bottle, then they're
just like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, aspergillus really screwed
up the Colorado market organics and it
[SPEAKER_01]: almost screwed up the Oregon market for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the growers fought back and were
like aspergillus is on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, it's on pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably on us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's just but you get these
companies coming in saying, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't want aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys need to make it illegal to have
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to test for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it tests positive, you guys
shouldn't be consuming it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those same people who tell you to push
that four point whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: EPMs are the same people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to like get rid of, you know,
organics because they're worried about
[SPEAKER_04]: aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, they just want to pound
more salt and pollute the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wild wild west.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as genetics, you know,
we saw some I saw some OG Kush that was
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That skittles is pretty baller.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a cut from that actually Brandon
and Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was third gen when those guys were
still working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been able to maintain the mom of it for
that long of a period of time and take
[SPEAKER_04]: good care of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure it didn't get into the wrong
hands and get populating virus or
[SPEAKER_04]: something else weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's one thing that I feel like
has happened that has hurt the industry as
[SPEAKER_04]: far as like keeping good genetics around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder if that's one of the reasons
why like the real sour is kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: this like unicorn that is just like super
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sour is a tricky one though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I keep seeing people say this is the
one and it's so close, but it's just I
[SPEAKER_04]: still have not always seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had the weasels diesel that I
got from my friend and that was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing, but it was still a little bit
different, but it smoked amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love those two for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a good, that'd be a
winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's been, you know,
a lot of, a lot of bullshit copies,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Hopladen did a number on sour diesel,
especially, you know, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: a really old plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, from the nineties,
it's like 30 years old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genetics aren't the same,
but I mean, there's still good chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still good old school chem D
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some good sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have any on me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be better if I did, but I'd like to
see it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I've grown a couple that were
close and I'm just like, almost,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, not quite there.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG, that one's just been able to be banger
for super long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've had that same cut for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, it's also like not
commercial.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like to grow that on a large
scale would be hard because it takes a
[SPEAKER_04]: long time to root it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it grows funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you probably don't want to be growing
that in the same room as other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like there's dynamics and
that's why some of these strains have gone
[SPEAKER_04]: out of like popularity is because of it's
easy to grow a bunch of gelatos that are
[SPEAKER_04]: like super uniform and they yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good production weed for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some phenos that are really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some expressions that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love gelato 41 still, you know,
the boccio cut, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the 33.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 33 is good too.
[SPEAKER_04]: 33 is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: 33 is actually a really good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's renamed about a gazillion other
things too, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing with the 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of names, but 41 is still
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the 45 had its place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trippy how many good cultivators of ours
came out of one cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you start thinking about
it, you know, if you like gelato,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you like gelato, there's,
there's 10 bangers that came out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: These, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's in a lot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of them breed really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little bit, you know,
for the hash people, which is popular now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as breeders are concerned,
the whole washing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it wash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it not wash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like five percenters only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only five or six percenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, and there's a handful of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me I'm the only six percenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause they're out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I've, I've actually grown
GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO and Banana Condor both wash over six.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, GMO, I was stoked at the
time, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's GMO though now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the guys that have like five
different strains, they're all like GMO
[SPEAKER_01]: based.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they wanted to get that six
percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, like what tastes the best
in rosin is something like Skittles,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is like two percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe three, if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be the best extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Rainbow Belts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some good sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know, the best sour rosin
that I've tasted comes from that J Plant
[SPEAKER_04]: speaker guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes, I get like an ounce every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like trickle it out to myself and it
tastes great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen the Finnish flower,
but the rosin, my friend actually gets it
[SPEAKER_04]: and.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice tart.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this sour cherry that's like super
tart from So Cal Dang.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make this rosin and that stuff is
just tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those ones that you want to
keep smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after you're really high,
you're like, I could still take one more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's kind of how Rainbow Belts
is to me, because it's that gas and that Z
[SPEAKER_04]: Tarp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's strong and it's just like,
man, makes your mouth like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like skittly, but not skittly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the Rainbow Belts?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moonbow is like one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That old school, like the 75 or whatever
was before the 75.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have some Moonbow rosin with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I know Adam from Archive and he
crushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do their rosins really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of theirs, I kind of feel like
they've done the best job, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as like getting the hashes that are
really like bangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, their flower is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go get their flower in Oregon,
it's super top notch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, especially that Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the 112 is the one I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy actually is a Nevada county
grower and his name's Skrillmo.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have heard of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He put this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was all grown with my stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I don't like is diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do like is Skittles crosses
that are complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like them watered down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to you got to make it
complex and different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to just a lighter version
of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no point really.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, who does a really good Skittles
cross is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lamb from Compassionate Heart is dirty
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really good string.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Vermont diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes some really good rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw some Afghan Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was like, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably got like some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hashy funkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like a Skittles light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh, I get it a little bit,
but it wasn't like Skittles is supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be overpowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to where like it's so bright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Skittles needs to be loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year, I actually grew a whole
garden of it with a partner in Nevada
[SPEAKER_04]: County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought and I was like, it was
growing too good.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my mind, I was like, the whole time I
was doubting it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the nursery basically gave us a
Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't even know what exactly it
was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took until about week two or three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, no, that is not Z
terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew an entire garden thinking that was
going to all be for rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it ended up being this other strain
that came out OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a good producer for the guy and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still what my whole intention and the
reason I even like was involved on that
[SPEAKER_04]: exact garden was to like get a whole field
of Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like those are the things that,
you know, there's certain projects that
[SPEAKER_04]: get me excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one that did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want jars of Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want like years supply.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like multiple years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it didn't work out last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about time is there's
always next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what are we going to smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some of this Nemo Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you see the market going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think you said your Internet has
been doing pretty good as far as web stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's going to get bigger
and bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, that's another part of my
winter and spring focus is like D size
[SPEAKER_04]: downsizing, not getting rid of the big
sizes of my products that I have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to offer like a four quart
bag of soil, a four quart bag of compost
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of like one and a half cubic feet
that cost fifty bucks to ship across the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not everybody needs that much anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're used to the NorCal grower like
who needs like truckloads worth of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, this whole new rec market
and like legalization has opened up a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of people to just growing their six plants
or depending on what state they live in,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, six to ten or whatever the
number is in every state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not even just for cannabis,
but we're seeing home vegetable gardeners
[SPEAKER_04]: like spend a little bit of money on their
crop because they care about what their
[SPEAKER_04]: outcome is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the beautiful thing about soil
and like your soil especially is it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: like you throw it out at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps going and gets better and better
and better every year.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I should say about
Pacific Reserve too is like we've really
[SPEAKER_04]: been able to like dial it in there to be
able to use this product line at scale,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also to be able to reuse soil and
compare the numbers and look at the yield
[SPEAKER_04]: compared to the fresh new soil and like
look side by side plants with new fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: soil and reuse soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a product that's called Vital
Soil Builder that's biochar, worm castings
[SPEAKER_04]: compost humus and bat and seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we basically at Pacific Reserve,
they've been doing two rounds in the same
[SPEAKER_04]: soil amending with like a cup of the soil
builder and a little bit of guano.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And stirring it up in the use soil and
replanting and the plants are actually
[SPEAKER_04]: even growing faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going even faster in the reuse
soil because they're still like leftover
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus they added this like fresh worm
castings compost and humus.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some biochar in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like living soil, you know,
round two, you know, it's not I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to go to the extreme of calling it
no till, which no till to me is a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of a just catchphrase anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it's low till anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who's busting out a tiller?
[SPEAKER_04]: But in reality, you got to pull out the
root ball and if you're growing outdoors,
[SPEAKER_04]: like let's face it, we got to like turn
the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to pull the weeds out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make the soil fluffy again so
that the roots can penetrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like way all for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the no till thing is a little bit of a
marketing thing that's like maybe it helps
[SPEAKER_04]: sell weed or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, let's face it like you
know, compressed soil isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: your best friend.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So given a little bit of fluff isn't like
a sin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like dumping a bunch of salt on
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to take away from the value
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't want to offend
anybody, but to me, the no till thing is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that came on like way late in
the game when we were already reusing and
[SPEAKER_04]: amending soil and cover crop and companion
crop and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the term no till is a little bit for
me, like not really describing what it is
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Living soil, I'm all for that term.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that term because that's what we're
all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microorganisms in the soil helping your
plant do a better job or helping your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: do a better job for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of the smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody likes the Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you seen any other stuff lately
that have been, you know, like exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, there is a little
resurgence for green weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that goes to the gases,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OGs and people still on that search for
the real sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's some hazes starting
to make a resurgence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shore is doing that big project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him a plan or two for that,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole haze thing is really cool,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody just didn't grow haze because it
took too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was a couple hazes that gave
haze a bad name and it was like the jacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like the old school jacks
because those were very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that linear jack that doesn't get you
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, but that's not how hazes get
you really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hazes should get you lit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I love the cough, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the Fort Collins cough is
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did some breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that with the banana skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Fort Collins cough from my buddy
Reuben.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plant is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows crazy, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like super, super thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just grew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just grew one plant of it over this
winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it came out phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was during that whole period when
like Nevada City got like four feet of
[SPEAKER_04]: snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So long story short, there was no power
for like 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was no lights for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took 14 years, 14 years, 14 weeks to
fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 years to fly would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it didn't even like take a hit that 10
day period of being, you know,
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe the structure, hazes don't
structure great anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the flower came out amazing,
tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has the Braxit stack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super unique as far as like the
profile of it is, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's definitely equatorial, haze-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little, but it's its own thing,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I guess the like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's way different than the PIF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is another version of NL5 by haze.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of diversity in the
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing I did with the shoreline
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of shoreline cross with
some of the popular stuff now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The banana skittles, skittles back cross,
grape gas, and double cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shoreline's got like this musky
funkiness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the musk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the musk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the cough has, I feel like,
the basement.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're both good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get them from the same person,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that like it really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that double cherry, is the cherry
coming out?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely like a sour cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I like sour cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some dabs of sour cherry,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a huge I like diversity in the
things I eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like diversity in things I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not just like, this is the only
thing I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll get on like these fits with
like skittles or with Pluto or with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these other ones where that's what I
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a whole bunch of different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one bag because it's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it's gone, I'll go back to
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like OG to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want to go back to OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time I get OG, I'll smoke it all just
because I like the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I like the taste of it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the good OGs that taste piney,
where you got that nice pine and earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the citrus is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like really citrusy kind of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost where you're tasting pine needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the Marcin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's stronger in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a combination of Marcin and
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of it have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Sour has it, but not to the extreme
like some of those OGs have it,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you feel like you're standing under
some redwood trees or something like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which actually, you can eat the new growth
off redwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever eaten the
sprouts off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're super piney.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste kind of like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time it's, you know, and you're eating
organics most of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me something earlier about most
of the flower that you smoke is from guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use vital products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use vital products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost feel like a connection to
everybody who's ever using our products is
[SPEAKER_04]: like an extension of what it is that I'm
all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I always feel like if
somebody is using a lot of vital products,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I know that they're putting a lot of
good energy into what it is they're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the outcome usually is more than
prevalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as customers that have won contests
and over the years, as long back as I can
[SPEAKER_04]: remember, people using vital have been
coming out on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this past year, Emerald Cub,
Rebel Grown, he's been a long term loyal
[SPEAKER_04]: vital customer for 10 plus years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day when 3rd Gen was sweeping
up the cups, they were always on the vital
[SPEAKER_04]: program.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've been keeping an eye
on this kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's using Cannabis Chris right now,
but he just won the Smoking Jacket last
[SPEAKER_04]: year, and he won that, and then he won
King of Zee Hill, which was the first cup
[SPEAKER_04]: that actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Castle.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Chris Castle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris won the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he did win the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy won the Rosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's won like five big contests
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's been using vital strictly for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love smoking his hash too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just seems like when you're proud
of what you do, and you know that you put
[SPEAKER_04]: out a good product, and you help other
people achieve greatness, then it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: an extra layer of rewardingness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so rewarding to know somebody else
succeeded from it, and then smoke the
[SPEAKER_04]: finished product, and then have access to
it whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's great being part of something
that's so much bigger than yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure, that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what it is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it's just so much of a bigger,
like the stuff we do has impact on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good or bad, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I care so much too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just like an ego thing where I
need to smoke the weed that's grown with
[SPEAKER_04]: my shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like check up on people growing
with my shit a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I love to visit farms, and I love to
like give my input.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you love flower too, so that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of you said earlier that
really resonates.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now isn't the best economic time to
be in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as being a cannabis lover,
it's probably the best time ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to drive around and go to huge
farms, and small farms, big farms,
[SPEAKER_04]: medium farms, talk about what I love,
help give advice if it's wanted,
[SPEAKER_04]: or just learn and hear what they're doing,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that we get paid to do this stuff
is pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to buy that by itself, to be able to
do what you love.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about our 18-year-old selves and
our 80-year-old selves as the only two
[SPEAKER_01]: people that you really need to impress,
and I think my 18-year-old self would be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: My 18-year-old self is blown away right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I got to work on impressing the
80-year-old and make sure that I can still
[SPEAKER_04]: be surviving then.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had one piece of advice to give
your younger self that first started out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry and doing the stuff that
you did with the soil, what would be that
[SPEAKER_01]: one piece of advice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of all, just be confident.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many times where I had
anxiety that something may or may not work
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even to this day, I have to remind myself
that it's going to work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's trying to get a big account
to buy stuff because sales aren't great,
[SPEAKER_04]: or whether it's somebody calls with a
complaint and you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no reason for them to complain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I think I care too much,
and I don't want to tell my younger self
[SPEAKER_04]: to not care, but on the other hand,
believe in your cause and just keep your
[SPEAKER_04]: eye on the prize, and it's going to work
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I spent too many years worrying
looking back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and my wife even have these
conversations like, I think we've spent
[SPEAKER_04]: too much time worrying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are the kind of lessons you
learn when you're older, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time to learn that you don't need
to worry because you have a stack of proof
[SPEAKER_01]: of the stuff that's going on where it's
like, all those times I worried and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about data points on my show a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout life, you get data points on
life, and cannabis, the more you smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more things you try.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn what you like and what you don't
like, but you also learn all the nuances
[SPEAKER_01]: and diversity that's out there between
each plant, between each smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else is like?
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount of people and the different
types of personalities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sometimes feel, even though I've been a
grower my whole life, a whole adult life,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been involved with growing
cannabis since 1988.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And never had a hiccup since.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always had that connection,
but sometimes I have different hats.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I go in as a vital garden supply,
not every place knows my history and not
[SPEAKER_04]: every person does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I feel like they look at me as
an outsider, as a sales guy who's just
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to push some product line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can sense that energy when I go to
certain places.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I respect that they're used to that,
but it's my job to make them feel
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable with me without bragging or
acting like I know it all, but more like
[SPEAKER_04]: making observations about what it is that
they've done and what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_04]: try to let them know that I respect where
they're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tricky game right now and
everybody's territorial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody thinks their system's better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get back to that competitive thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a million nutrient companies right
now trying to get a sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, there's always
somebody behind me trying to get the next
[SPEAKER_04]: guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to just believe in the fact that if
they have success with my product and the
[SPEAKER_04]: finished product comes out as good as it's
supposed to, they're not going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with something like soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replacing your soil is a big deal,
especially if you're reusing your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think a lot of people have tried
different things and seen if they could
[SPEAKER_04]: skimp on soil or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They later find out that that was probably
not the best route to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our last guests is homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more so the effect than
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get some stuff that looks great,
smells great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually doesn't have the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe every once in a while you find some
stuff that does, but definitely doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a soil fan, but I've also learned to
appreciate some people who are growing
[SPEAKER_04]: just like cocoa perlite blends and cocoa
because cocoa can attach some microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can hold some life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like Rockwell can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Half the time I see these Rockwell grows
in these big facilities and they're just
[SPEAKER_04]: pounding them with as much salt as they
possibly can to try to get their five
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds of light or whatever it is that
they're getting these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's algae growing on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't seem right to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least the cocoa gives the plant enough
space in a home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a good flavor with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some good, I guess people call it
nowadays, synganic, cocoa grown weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: People using some microbes combined with
some salt and coming out with something
[SPEAKER_04]: that actually has a happy in between,
a good yield, has that bag appeal,
[SPEAKER_04]: but actually has some turps and some
flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another thing that I'm starting to
have some appreciation for.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my younger years, I would have been
more critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, I thought that any amount
of salt was going to kill the microbes and
[SPEAKER_04]: it was just throwing it out the window,
but through years of experience and seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: people and different grows go through
cycles and sometimes facility will be all
[SPEAKER_04]: organic and then the next thing you know,
they make a switch because they want to
[SPEAKER_04]: save money or they hired a new grower or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Halfway through the crop, they may switch
from Vital to whatever brand and then next
[SPEAKER_04]: thing you know, I go there and I see
mushrooms still growing in the soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, wait, the salt didn't kill the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still fungus there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something I did learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first couple years of seeing the
commercial scale go from the backyard
[SPEAKER_04]: grower to loud pack types, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely something also as a
grower and from a nutrient company
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint, to be able to see the
evolution and learn how that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: combine products and there isn't
necessarily one recipe and you got to do
[SPEAKER_04]: what works for you as a grower and me as a
provider of products, I got to help the
[SPEAKER_04]: grower understand how my stuff could fit
into what it is they're already doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of that Skittles now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I prefer smoking stuff that burns
down to the roach, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't, something's wrong,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of genetics that
just aren't capable of it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where like you can get, I mean,
that's one of my favorite things where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a roach, you fire it up the next day
and it still tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't have that stale flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then something got done right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever see the cat piss back in the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ammonia, ammonia and skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not gas, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super skunky.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tenth of a gram would smell the whole
room up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also the champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Around the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Champagne from Champele.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name came up, we were talking about it
the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like somebody that I originally like would
work with that OG with, also was working
[SPEAKER_04]: with that champagne and he was friends
with Champele.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was like, we're talking- Yeah,
no one has that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's long gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking like 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was bag seed from Beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of champagne?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cause nobody has the champagne cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not exist as far as I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost sure that's from bag seed from
Beasters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually need to ask him that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back in the day, there was tons of
those Beasters in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some good stuff in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of stuff, but they also
used- Some of it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying it was a bad thing,
even though it was Beasters, but- Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, long story short.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those worlds collided at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But OG rose to the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG was like all anybody- For the longest
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For such a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG was as good as gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to get real good OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like, unless you were growing it
yourself or your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your friends were growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and a lot of us who grew it,
we made packs with each other to not give
[SPEAKER_04]: it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: To keep that value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did all right for a decent amount
of time, but eventually everybody got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it turned upside down and nobody grew
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is somebody gets a bag seed
and then everybody gets the bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even with OG, a lot of people that I
had, there's a lot of bunk cuts of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bag seed OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, bag seed does never get without OG
that I've seen.
No, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And low terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your OG should be smoking to the roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll enjoy that for sure.
