[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, my special guest is Jason Hadley
from Lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today, Jason?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fantastic, and it is an honor and a
pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've known each other a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you through... I want to say we got
connected through Autumn Carsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Autumn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been on the podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it crazy how it's just like this
huge industry, but it's such a small
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean... It's a little bit incestuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a good way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because Alabama's not legal,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you tell everybody a little
bit about yourself and how you got your
[SPEAKER_01]: start in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, my name is Jason
Hadley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently with a company called Filter
that's owned by Lighthouse Worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just sort of a funny way that you
like fall into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not one of those... I was not the
cool kid in class, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at some point, I didn't really
discover cannabis until probably like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe my senior year of high school,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny because like when I first
started smoking, like it was like close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the last day of school in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wouldn't you know it, who do I see
smoking weed in the parking lot at school,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like this rival guy that used to bully
me all the time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turns out I see him,
he sees me, we lock eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at him and I'm like,
dude, I'm not going to bust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sat there and we smoked a dupe in
the school parking lot together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen him since, but everything
was squashed in that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just... Oh, it was one of those
moments where I was like, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing really brings people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's one of the few drugs you do in a
circle, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever like got their cocaine on a
lazy Susan, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in this country, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, but so, you know, I go to
college, I do the rigmarole, I buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: American dream look line and sinker type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a sales job, I get laid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a buddy of mine, while I was
collecting unemployment, a buddy of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, hey, do you want to come trim
weed for me or with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: For a grower, I know it's cash under the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the legacy market days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yeah, sure, I would love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go and I meet this guy,
Sky Hank, if you're familiar with Sky Hank
[SPEAKER_00]: at all, from Smoke of Mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually know him from Autumn as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it turns out like I'm trimming for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I had like an actual working
career outside of cannabis, it turns out I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed up on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew how to read, I knew how to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was dependable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd follow through like, you know,
stuff that's like kind of valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, you don't see a lot of that
at the time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they're like, hey,
do you want to work for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I become the weekend guy and I
start learning the ins and outs of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: management and facility management.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're talking like a 5,000
square foot facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, by today's standards,
you know, practically cottage grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, so then I go to become the
weekend manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like any chef wants to start
their own restaurant, I got it together to
[SPEAKER_00]: get my own commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took over somebody else's problems
for lack of a better term, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like the build out was,
you know, designed by Dr. Seuss and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anything that could go wrong
would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my grows, my grows would
have never passed compliance testing in
[SPEAKER_00]: today's age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and then I was running,
I was running that for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: until the cops said, yeah, maybe you
shouldn't be growing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And came in and took the whole thing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I turned out at that time,
Skye Hank had invented Smart B
[SPEAKER_00]: controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which was for those of you out there
that may not know, it was a small,
[SPEAKER_00]: it still is, it exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small like wireless communication
sensor device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like a wireless troll master
system for your 50 light and under crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and then Smart B shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a little time swimming around at
Spectrum King until I figured out what I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that the filter guys
wanted to buy Smart B a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had met them back then and then they
invented this filter product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they called me up and they said,
hey, do you want to make a change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't even have to put the
question mark on the end before I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yes, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I come to find out that these
filter guys who I know nothing about are
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this much larger company called
Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their bread and butter is like,
think of it as like FDA compliant troll
[SPEAKER_00]: master systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their primary market is like
pharmaceutical, semiconductor,
[SPEAKER_00]: aerospace, clean room manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do the systems for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're not obviously measuring
like DLI and PAR and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're measuring particles and air
differential pressures coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: different doorways and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sophistication was a little much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much for this industry at this point
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, regulation may call for it,
but that's a whole other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so, you know, they're like,
listen, you know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to talk to, to, you know,
Stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll teach you everything you need to
know about microbe control as it pertains
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, sweet ass, where do I
start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a rumor that you had to have a
black belt to get into Lighthouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that the weirdest thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they jumped you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I decided to get sextant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it turns out so Lighthouse
Worldwide Solutions, it started,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was started by this, this lady named
Dr. Tae Young Kim, who is the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking female Taekwondo practitioner in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somehow or another, I don't know
where this leap came from, but at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point she's opened up a karate school or
Taekwondo school.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she came to from Korea with like
dollars in her pocket and did all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: American dream stuff to get, you know,
to owning her own studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden she decided she
wanted to start like a particle counting
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where that comes from,
but hey, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out all of the C team is like
her black belt students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the president of the company is like a
fifth degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boss is a fifth degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: His boss is a fifth degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the lobby of the building,
like it was so, it was a surreal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not used to the like the
corporate environment I've worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lobby had, was lined with
magazines, Black Belt Magazine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Taekwondo Magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they're all covers that Dr. Kim
and all of the C team were like cover
[SPEAKER_00]: models for, like whatever you call that,
the equivalent in martial arts publishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they're like breaking
boards and catching arrows and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the break room, you know,
like the CEO of the company standing on a
[SPEAKER_00]: rock, you know, shirtless with a bandana,
like, you know, doing cool like mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: top poses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that though, I will say that
because of that, like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: made me feel really good as a company
because, you know, like typically on
[SPEAKER_00]: martial arts is very, you know,
based in like honor, respect, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of things that not that like
backbiting that you see at like other job
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and they've been very nurturing
and supporting along the way and helped me
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop my skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowing me to get certifications
and certain things to grow my knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: base so that I can be more effective for
my customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, four years later,
here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm in my fifth year now,
now that I'm thinking about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the time flies by and they've just
been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I figured it like this,
is it's like, I don't need to know more
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of guys that know how to
grow fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to know more about one
particular aspect of it that everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And be able to specialize in that because,
you know, it's not just like hock and air
[SPEAKER_00]: filters and particle counters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's being of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping these, you know, growers like
cut a learning curve that state compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: threw on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem that they're facing is
like the equivalent of being told you have
[SPEAKER_00]: ghosts in your building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go find the ghost in your building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily enough, there's actually a lot
of commonalities between clean room
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing and where cannabis really
should be operating at in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain consistent testing success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you work with Peter McGuire too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is very much a black belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a really wicked smart dude and
he's mentored me along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Peter also is a member of
the cannabis section of ASTM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're coming out with standards
because that's the thing about cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: that as we know in our early days,
you had to be part plumber, part
[SPEAKER_00]: electrician, part carpenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I almost electrocuted myself
cutting a pigtail for a cord that was
[SPEAKER_00]: still plugged into the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a lot of standards in
telling you how you should operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I often tell my clients like
it's sort of like if you were lost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest, you'd watch what the rabbits eat,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're looking to like kind of
mimic a higher standard, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to kind of glom onto hospital
standard because it's what we see more
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, you know, not a lot of people
are in clean rooms and that's by design
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, with that though,
hospitals are fighting different things
[SPEAKER_00]: than cannabis is fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when it comes to operating,
I tell people, if you could live at pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top end and food manufacturing at
the bottom end, if you could live in that
[SPEAKER_00]: butter zone, you're usually going to be
pretty good from run to run and you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be running a pretty tight ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the funny part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I found a home in cannabis as far as
like, you know, maybe one day I'll be at
[SPEAKER_00]: another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day I'll start my own company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows what the future holds
for me, but what I do know is that this
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is very much feels like home
to me compared to other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: industries I've worked in in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's a great industry and
I think, you know, we're lucky to have
[SPEAKER_01]: people like you that do a lot of hand
holding in this industry too, like getting
[SPEAKER_01]: in and kind of explaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like there's definitely like
a learning curve for a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming from cannabis into clean room
practices and you got yourself and you got
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter that are going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Peter's done some lecturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to some of his lectures on clean
rooms and I've talked to you on the phone
[SPEAKER_01]: when we were getting our filters
installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that that's great to be
able to have that, not just the expertise,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being able to walk people through
knowing that they're in a place where they
[SPEAKER_01]: could use help and to get them the help
that they need, that's going to improve
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's so often that like
the industry doesn't know what it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's nice though is, is that you can
feel, as I was saying today to a client,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you can feel the yearning for
the learning, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, you know, like legacy market
days from a cleanliness standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was more about vanity because
the accountability was, you were only held
[SPEAKER_00]: to weight, bag appeal and potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, you just used to cut the
bad part off and put the rest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: turkey bag, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, things have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to explain to my clients,
like, dude, the reason you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate in the open is because,
and that the state is willing to let you
[SPEAKER_00]: operate in the open is because you have to
meet a minimum product safety standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll let you operate legally,
but you can't put like moldy bunko boof
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how that's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in this state, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's sort of the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting part is, is that while
they put these testing mandates in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it just simply says,
they haven't really cared how you operate
[SPEAKER_00]: up until the point of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, like, they're not telling
you what you have to do on a day to day
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just saying, this bag,
this turkey, bag, this pound has to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: X state of compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's starting to change a
little bit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hilarious because like Peter
and I have, you know, have been sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I've always kind of felt a little
bit like Chicken Little, like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: alarmist going like, stop using single
bucket mops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use double and triple bucket
mops, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know sometimes I sound like a crazy
person about it, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, there's not a lot of future
proofing that happens in cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a very proactive industry as much
as it's a reactive industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it has been in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my observation, most of the time,
like, an investor isn't necessarily going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to build the grow room of the
cultivator's dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, no, we want to be able
to make back our investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe when we've made like 5X on our
investment, we'll start talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements or whatever that benchmark
is, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And very few people are prepared for
what's coming with federal legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: and the possibilities of, you know,
the standards that they will have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so it's funny because we,
you know, we've always had these
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations around the water cooler,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, granted, I work at a home office,
so it's a rather lonely water cooler,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, just kind of like as we've
talked and strategized over the years and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the prevailing theory was,
you know, that if federal, if slash when
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legalization came, that even if it
wasn't necessarily the FDA that was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be mandating operation standards,
it would be some sort of organization
[SPEAKER_00]: under the FDA who would probably still
pull the current FDA regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A case in point, like a lot of state
license criteria was pulled from something
[SPEAKER_00]: called the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was straight lifted right off
the page and copied and pasted right on
[SPEAKER_00]: their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia is the organization that
develops the standards that are used in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA is the enforcement body of the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia, you know, like I said,
if you look it up, their testing standards
[SPEAKER_00]: are the same as like Michigan,
California, you know, several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have like, you know, four types of
aspergillus that are detect, non-detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they're rocking that kind of
stuff, it's usually like they lifted it
[SPEAKER_00]: from the USP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so if they're going to lift the
testing standards from the USP,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what are the odds they're probably
going to lift the operating standards from
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're starting to see a little bit
of that change start to creep in where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not necessarily taking the federal
level green light to make things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these states are starting to take
operating standards at a federal level and
[SPEAKER_00]: apply them at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take, for example, the state of New
York just recently legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state of New York is requiring
that you be adherent to ready for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody out in podcast land,
write this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 CFR part 117.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the regulations set for the
manufacturing of human food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how every cookie factory
operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how every cereal factory,
every, you know, potato chip company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one cookie factory that doesn't
operate like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to mention that,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, you know, but, but by and large,
like those levels of standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York had baked it right in from the
jump as far as like right when they
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Michigan is currently considering
the deployment of 117 specifically parts A
[SPEAKER_00]: and parts B parts A and B, which isn't
that big of a deal at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that because part A is mostly
like definitions, like what is a micro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is, you know, this, what is that part
B just basically starts to say that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are becoming that you have to be CGMP
compliant current, current good
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing practice compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but they reserve in the fine
print, it says we reserve the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: enforce later subsequent sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it gets live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, for instance, part C,
you would, you were going to have to start
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand something called HACCP and
HACCP stands for hazard analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: critical control points, which is it's a
food safety philosophy and practice that
[SPEAKER_00]: originally came about when NASA went to
Pillsbury and was like, we need to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that there's no food spoilage and
space because who wants the runs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: spacesuit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, so Pillsbury develops this
like methodology of being able to like
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze their process, find faults in it,
find corrections, preventative actions,
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, you're going to
start to see this kind of brave new world
[SPEAKER_00]: open up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you got the old dogs that
are like, well, I didn't get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: business to fill out paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yes, but businesses and
industries evolve, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're not using wheel spoke cars,
wheel spoke tires, because somebody's like
[SPEAKER_00]: vulcanization, that's devil talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like nobody does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like things innovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, most people got into
this industry because they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work a day job or pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so here you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, things have definitely evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I would completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I find that I seamlessly
slip right in because you do have these
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want to be at a higher echelon
of operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but they don't know where to turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know where to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news is, is all of that
information is all out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's funny because I sell an
air purifier, but my competition isn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy making an air purifier across the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's change, discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy says dot, dot, dot, you know,
my buddy says you should use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just like, dude, you just need
a better class of buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I try to really pride
myself on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to put anything out
information wise that isn't backed up by a
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the source is not your buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Peter McGuire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Peter McGuire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's, he's in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering what your thoughts are on
aspergillus and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause Oregon tried to pass the,
the law that they were about regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus and not being in and testing
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, they have to round it found out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything had aspergillus in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I mean, it listens from a
cultivator standpoint, I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pain point, you know, that, that section
of the country, as far as they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies, it's, it's very well
entrenched in, you know, let's,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's call them old world methodologies,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, you'd be surprised what
I've been willing to smoke in my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd smoke anything from Oregon cause
I've smoked stuff from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't even know bud came like
in a three dimensional form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it came as a feather cause I
didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand what Mexico is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew in bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the corner of the bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like eating counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, so yeah, no, in Oregon,
yeah, it's, it's, it's a tough one because
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I mean, I have an unpopular,
but hot take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it goes a little something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't grow clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to reform the laws
back to where they originally were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if I pissed off anybody in
Oregon, but you know, I mean, at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day, it's like, again, that,
that product safety standard is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the, the propensity for
people getting tainted weed is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not all that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that, but when it hits you,
it's, it, you know, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: debilitating, particularly because we've
been, you know, calling this medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it legal for, you know, 20,
30 years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, if you're going to grow
medicine, then you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make medicine the way medicine is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the, my, my take on,
like I said, hot take unpopular opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very unpopular, very unpopular on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a lot of slack for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't honestly know what the balance
is because I think there's a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to support growers that are growing
outdoors in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I feel like there's a
need to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to support small business,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, we want to
support small business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we want a safe product that's
safe for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the thresholds need to be
adjusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's probably what it's
going to come down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, and especially because,
you know, if nothing else, like the States
[SPEAKER_00]: are starting to see like revenue spikes
in, in their tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they don't want that to go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if they do have to like,
you know, make it like detect non-detect
[SPEAKER_00]: or X number of total coliform units,
you know, from your total yeast and mole
[SPEAKER_00]: count or some, some sort of give and take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and not only that,
but here's the thing is that that law,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was put into effect was basically
like, okay, you guys have to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: change everything you do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an X number, like long window to
make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now everything after that has to be
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't, it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fair to the growers, you know,
because like, again, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of, a lot of the legacy
methodologies just simply don't translate
[SPEAKER_00]: into like a compliant world, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, I mean, you know,
let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I applaud Oregon for being able to get
that repealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cause think about it, like no
other state is, is getting that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying power that, that they're all of a
sudden going to start changing the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hat's off to them personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have some amazing clean air
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to tell us a little bit about the
product line that you guys have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we were talking, we mentioned
earlier filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So filter is a commercial grade HEPA air
purifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same type of HEPA technology
that's used in pharmaceutical clean rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you would call a capture and
removal type of device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the philosophy in clean
rooms is they don't care what's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want it out of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't care if it's dust,
if it's mold, if it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you remove all of the
particles, which difficult to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: admittedly difficult to do, but like,
if you reduce the particles, you reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the problems that start out in
our facilities typically tend to come from
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of times our facilities
are negatively pressured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pulling outside air in,
especially if you're near places like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're growing near like a garbage dump
or you're growing near other growers or
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries that have different
requirements around their output and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal factories, for example,
are widely known to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember they get their corn and their
grains and all that stuff on boxcars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just dumped and siloed but into the
factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that stuff that's just sort of
rotting is, it's still usable for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of making Lucky Charms or
whatever, but like cereal has a kill step
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the production process, so they can
take in like different types of,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say stuff you wouldn't normally
necessarily eat raw, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: under its current state when it arrives
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the time it's made into a box of
cereal, it's perfectly edible because
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's been exposed to that stuff
has been killed off in the production
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, their material handling is
constantly like pluming molds and such
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming off of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending if you're upwind,
downwind, whatever, you know, you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, there's a propensity for you
to be able to pull those problems in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen it in lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the HEPA air purifier,
which is continually remediating
[SPEAKER_00]: particles, it's like, you know,
at the end of the day, like you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to not just get rid of particles,
but it's also very helpful to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect them and identify them in your air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the other devices we manufacture
is called an air particle counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it's designed to do is it's
basically pulling air in through a laser
[SPEAKER_00]: or through a box, it's running it past a
laser, it's sizing it, it's counting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's giving you a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then start to use to understand
the volume or what you would call the
[SPEAKER_00]: particle pressure, the particle burden of
your airspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that you can use to
kind of understand the general cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: of your air, but also you can use it to,
let's say like start to capture or how
[SPEAKER_00]: would I say this, potentially start to
identify problems that can be in your air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for instance, I'm trying to,
as we're talking here, I'm trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a ock here that I wanted to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I share a screen with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a falling particle car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you understand the concept that
heavier particles are going to fall out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the air faster than smaller particles,
you can see here that a 100 micron
[SPEAKER_00]: particle, which would be like roughly the
width of a human hair, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to fall to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular case, they're saying
it's falling one meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did was they took a glass
tube that's one meter long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dropped the particle in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They timed to see how long it takes to
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a 100 micron particle, the width of
your human hair, like less than two
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds to fall one meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to consider that in cannabis,
your smallest particle thread is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: one micron and larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one to two microns is like an
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spuma goddess spore, probably one of the
smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a one micron particle will take almost
five hours to fall one meter in perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: still air, undisturbed by ambient air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it, if it takes five
hours to fall in a tube where nothing's
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing it, and then you go to an
indoor facility and you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: fans on the walls, doors opening and
closing, HVAC that's perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: intermittently spaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, through the ductwork and stuff
like that, you're creating what's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: turbulent airflow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these one micron particles,
these smaller mold spores, they can stay
[SPEAKER_00]: aloft indefinitely, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where the idea, and all
they're doing is swirling around the air
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're coming to the seas of flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time, like I'm sure at some
point, if you've ever walked past like a
[SPEAKER_00]: candle or something like that,
and like the wind from you passing by
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbs the flame, you know, that happens
at the particle level too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, those particles are also very
easy to adhere to our clothing and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if somebody's in scrubs,
you know, you got to remember like to a
[SPEAKER_00]: one micron particle, like, you know,
threads are like, you know, giant like
[SPEAKER_00]: anchor ropes or like those ropes you use
in the gym, you know, a little thread that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see in a shirt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To us, it looks like a more like a hand to
a hair, but to a one micron mold spore,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's able to adhere easier and then
travel about the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with your particle counter,
I think one of the coolest things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: suggested is to actually use it to test
before you're doing it, like when either
[SPEAKER_01]: drain your build out before you actually
have plants in and then after once you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the filter installed and,
you know, being able to test the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's called baselining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the technical term is the
baseline of building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is, you know, like let's
say the last nail and screw goes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: construction crew leaves, you do your
final cleanup, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the time where you would
take particle counts to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would take air samples to see if you
can identify anything in your air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest swab samples as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water samples, you know, just test the
Jesus out of that place, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to know A, are there any
problems in there that you might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to catch and remediate before you ever
move plants in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you grow plants on top of a
problem, you're just proliferating a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the other side of this,
too, is that you then also have some
[SPEAKER_00]: benchmarks for cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you know what the building was
like before plants ever moved in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cleaning and testing regimens and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have something to compare against as
you progress through cycle after cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and then not for nothing,
but I talked to some of my clients about
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, because I'm always helping
them to, you know, be successful so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they scale and expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're thinking about buying a
second building, I'm like, let's go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: take some samples now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like the building that much,
but it's got a problem and you can prove
[SPEAKER_00]: it, then that might maybe give you some
negotiating power on price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, or maybe that you might
want to avoid it altogether, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people, as opposed to five years ago,
I think a lot of people are thinking like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's in the building that I'm going
into?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of pathogens are already in the
building?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but understanding the
history of that building, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not building from the ground up
from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, you find like,
say, for instance, in the New England
[SPEAKER_00]: states, like your Massachusetts Rhode
Island areas and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of that construction is a
hundred years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mold spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so it's like,
you know, I'm telling a man, you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a lot of epoxy around this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got to kind of
hermetically seal all these problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not like you're going to be
replacing wood beams and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's, you know, you have old
construction, but then you also have like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the building used for prior?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I might not necessarily want
to move a cannabis cultivation into like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was manufacturing dog food
previously or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want to move into a
slaughterhouse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want businesses that didn't
have anything to do with organic products
[SPEAKER_00]: prior, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those things will leave residual
imprint in the building long after that
[SPEAKER_00]: business has closed and moved on and it's
just waiting for the next client,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if, I don't know, like a more
innocuous business buys an old dog food
[SPEAKER_00]: factory, they're not as susceptible to the
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the plants that are the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are so sensitive, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where I have to explain to
people, you're not, you're not growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cucumbers and tomatoes that have
skin that you can wash and you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: like some sort of spray to or something
like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're growing something that's sticky
and catches anything that passes by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the remediation starts before you
get the plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree with you more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the other side of it
too is it's not even necessarily like the
[SPEAKER_00]: building has an illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, our day-to-day lives
from a microbe standpoint are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: savage by comparison to like the
cleanliness level you want in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, both you and I sitting
here right now, we have 100,000 skin cells
[SPEAKER_00]: sloughing off of our body per minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we look like, we look like the top of
a glass of Sprite at like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the, we're effervescent, you know,
at that microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, with that, we pick up a
lot of things in our day-to-day lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on the couch, you know,
Aspergillus fumigatus, largest producer of
[SPEAKER_00]: it is our, you pick up a lot of it from
your own bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, with that in mind,
it's like people tend to become almost as
[SPEAKER_00]: much, if not more so, a danger to the
process compared to the environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one thing to grow like in a
barn, but it's another thing to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: street clothes in a barn, you know,
like you're just kind of adding to the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, a lot of it has to do with,
you know, how, what are you doing around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keeping a barrier between
yourself and your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, can we talk a little bit about using
agar plates and how you can test for
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens and problems in your buildings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, let's say you're moving into a
building and you want to figure out what
[SPEAKER_01]: the problems are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a Lighthouse AC100 air
microbial sampler.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may look familiar to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in fact that you may have used
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did send this one to you,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I see my thumb print on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what you see here, and I just want to
make sure that the background doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: obscure it, but basically you got a cover
for the sampler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a sampling head and you can see
as I hold it up to the camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a bunch of holes that are embedded
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you would do is you'd put a
Petri dish here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd snap the cover on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd set the buttons up and you would
draw a specific amount of air for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific amount of time onto the Petri
dish, which then you would cap and then
[SPEAKER_00]: send off to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use malt extract agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be what's suggested because
that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's another one,
tryptic soy agar or potato dextrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to look that up, but I always use
MEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certain agars do not play,
do not capture the things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, powdery mildew doesn't plate
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use a different kind of device
in order to capture powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that device, we don't sell them,
we don't make them, but we made an adapter
[SPEAKER_00]: for their testing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they use something called,
I don't know if you've ever heard of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a Zephon biopump.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take something called an aerosol
cassette, which is essentially just to
[SPEAKER_00]: boil it down to like explain like on five
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a hockey puck, small hockey puck
shaped plastic disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air can go in and flow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inside the center of that is like in a
little adhesive circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so air impacts the particles,
you know, the airflow impacts the
[SPEAKER_00]: particles on an adhesive circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be looked at under a
microscope for visual study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't necessarily incubate it and
grow something out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like a lift tape sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lift tape sample of your air.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I mean, obviously I'm
a big fan of swabbing as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, I just want to know as
much data as possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open up your Trollmaster,
you open up your Arroyo or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be able to see like the
graphic representation of the heartbeat of
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to look at that and
you can start to see the interplay between
[SPEAKER_00]: systems in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I mean, if I was able to,
you know, for instance, I could even show
[SPEAKER_00]: you what a lab report looks like to kind
of give you an idea of what somebody can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect from a data standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll share this with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a lab report where I've
redacted the names to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, like if you look at
column one, does my mouse show up on this
[SPEAKER_00]: too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look over here, you see we
tested hall one, hall two, tricure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the attic area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason, this hallway was actually
just one hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took two tests at it because one day
when I was there, I saw them transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa because they didn't have any other
available workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have to do their work in the
hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I want to see if there's a
difference because they're paying for the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see, is there a difference
between the area that they work in and the
[SPEAKER_00]: area that they don't work in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so you can see here,
like, what it's listing is then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: listing the sample volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took 500 liters of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it has the time on here,
but you'd quickly want to note how long of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sample you took.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can see under the fungal
identification list, this is all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have specifics in mind,
you can always mention them to the lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can make a note on it to add it to
their list of things to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some molds are very industry
specific, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see in hall one,
we found five colony forming units of
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus niger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other end that wasn't being
used for transplanting, we only found two,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see where the concentration
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found some in their dry cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a little up in the attic,
which kind of says that maybe there was
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a leak up there that might be
beginning to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, by the way, for what it's worth,
this one down here, cladosporium,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever been in a facility
that I've tested that's ever not had
[SPEAKER_00]: cladosporides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a common plant pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where it got really interesting in
this particular lab report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was what was eye opening was this
one here is penicillium citrinone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, this is off the
charts compared to Aspergillus niger,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 192 colony forming units.
[SPEAKER_00]: 302, 102, 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going like, what is this and
where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's not why they called me to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they called me to come in about
because they were failing for Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: niger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, let's just see what
this thing captures, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they found a few other
things like yeast colonies and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to look back at this penicillium
citrinone and discovered that it is a mold
[SPEAKER_00]: that is on decaying matter and typically
grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found on grains like corn and rice
and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I think I'd mentioned earlier,
you know, having a cereal factory nearby,
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns out this is where I kind of came
up with this realization and use it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: talking point was these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I did a Google overhead
search, I discovered that they were like a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter mile downwind from a General Mills
cereal processing factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another point in time,
I took another test from the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the building and the penicillium citrinone
was dis-elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's like that's the level
of eye-opening this because when you get
[SPEAKER_00]: like a total yeast and mold count report,
like you want to know what total,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the yeast and the molds are,
because that's going to be a key in being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to figure out the root cause of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when you get your
Aspergillus fumigannus, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the biggest, you know,
producer of it is our bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that might speak to like a
cleanliness issue, you know, where like a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility culture, hygiene culture issue,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy for someone to scratch their
head and then go back to touching plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People touch, or touch your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or touch your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do this stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your phone has 25,000 microbes per square
inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody that's watching, make sure to
sanitize your phone regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipe it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, obviously, best case
scenario, you leave it out, leave it out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the critical area, but I understand
that's not reflective of reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what are the measures that
you can take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will wipe down their phones,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will put it in a plastic bag,
like a Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be good with that, you know,
because here's the other thing about like
[SPEAKER_00]: wiping down your phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is contact time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So contact time, for those that don't
know, is the minimum amount of time that a
[SPEAKER_00]: disinfectant needs in order to achieve the
eradication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're wiping down your phone and
you just wipe it, wipe it, wipe it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you didn't necessarily like leave it
wet for a certain amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you took another towel and you dried it
off, you're not getting the full potential
[SPEAKER_00]: of that disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about alcohol because not
alcohol, all alcohol is created equal,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're sanitizing surfaces
with alcohol, which I would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach is probably a lot better for
Hoplate and Veroid, as opposed to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I learned something from Peter McGuire
a long time ago, and it was the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between 90% and 70%, which I've used that
over and over and over in conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's an important thing for
everybody to learn the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% is great for cleaning your pipes and
bongs all day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the reason that it's 90% alcohol
is because it's only 10% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you dumb down the alcohol to like
70%, you didn't have 30% water,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that the cleansing agent takes
longer to evaporate from the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: and AirGo gives you more, a longer contact
time for it to achieve the eradication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here's the fun thing about contact
time, if you will, is that you might read
[SPEAKER_00]: on a label that it says like spray and
leave wet for 10 minutes, but you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: know how long it takes for it to dry too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you spray it and walk away and
go do something else and it hasn't met
[SPEAKER_00]: that contact time, again, not getting the
full potential from that disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually would need to go back and
wet it again, like do a second
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that's all buried in the
back on the labels and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I use that example all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, here I have a can of Lysol right
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just carry can of the Lysol
around, that's what I do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On these labels here, it literally says
like, leave for SARS-CoV-2 on hard
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, two minutes, killed rotavirus,
left wet for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things, it depends on what
you're trying to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surface contact time is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I'm a huge proponent of reading
your labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge proponent of contacting
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get questions all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you recommend this cleanser or
this cleanser?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, if you use them properly,
both of them should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use them properly and they're
designed to kill the thing you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill, then they should both do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I always tell people,
I'm like, call the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you, a disinfected manufacturer
definitely wants to speak to their
[SPEAKER_00]: customers because they want to make sure
that they're customers are using their
[SPEAKER_00]: product correctly, that they're using it
often so that they can sell you more of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to make sure you are as
knowledgeable as possible on their
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and most of them have pretty good
customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and I could tell you like
here in cannabis, like, man, customer
[SPEAKER_00]: service is key, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean- People in cannabis aren't used to
customer service though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like, you have a problem with your
weed or who grew your weed or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have questions about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, Instagram, you might be
able to get a reply, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the legacy years, that was all
there was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, and the other
thing is like, you know, remember I speak
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily to cultivators, but,
you know, and cultivators like have
[SPEAKER_00]: historically been big fish in their pond,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when I was growing,
I liked the Sinatra treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't like the Sinatra treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in life, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, it's like, if these growers,
you know, that I speak to on a day-to-day
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, they feel like I know what I'm
talking about, they feel like I can answer
[SPEAKER_00]: their questions, and that I pick up the
phone and I'm prompting my responses to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, like, it says worlds to like
building trust, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because, you know, I'll say that
it's one thing to get into a facility and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bunch of filters, up on the walls
and in the ceilings and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not much of a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the career comes in is helping these
guys get to all the other questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: are related to microbe control outside of
my filter, and that way they scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: expand to site number two, and then site
number three, and then they recommend me
[SPEAKER_00]: to their friends, and then now I'm
starting to get into their network,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, all for just being this guy
that's like trying to be of help,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a day and age, where if you have a
problem with Instagram, you can't call
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it near impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meta makes it near impossible to contact
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you know, there's ways to contact
them and, you know, through chats and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you're a paid advertiser,
they're more apt to talk to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but remember, like I said, the users of
Instagram are the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as far as from a customer service
standpoint, if my account got flags
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can't get shown to
non-followers, you know, because my
[SPEAKER_00]: content is a little, you know,
toes the line of good taste, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Racy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little racy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing I noticed is that I
love this industry because low brow humor
[SPEAKER_00]: goes really far.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I'm in the business of talking
about shit that's difficult to explain and
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't very interesting to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you have to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's like, what's the way that I can
make it palatable, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I throw a dick joke in and yet the
text underneath it actually teaches you
[SPEAKER_00]: something, I at least, you know,
that's the photos you see in my feed are
[SPEAKER_00]: like more to generate the shock and awe to
get you to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously, they're tied to
whatever I want to talk about in the post,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the text.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like,
yeah, I mean, I'm like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: social media is this river, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as a stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're standing at the shore,
everything's going past you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody's not standing at the
shore at the moment your information goes
[SPEAKER_00]: by, they miss it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's where the
hashtags come in and blabity, blabity,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point in saying that is it's like,
it softens the blow, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense of like, this level of
information can be really intimidating for
[SPEAKER_00]: some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but let's make education fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like we're trying to make
education fun and there's no reason
[SPEAKER_01]: education and learning shouldn't be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but you're going to
retain it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the retention level is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I get people that tell me
they're like, you know, you did this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture with this thing and now I can't
unsee it, but that means I can't un-forget
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that means I can't forget it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to make it last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it has, but, you know,
I've gotten a couple of, I'm triggered,
[SPEAKER_00]: please take this post down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you have a right to
not follow me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Below we live in, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sensitive times these days,
you know, it is what it is, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely know that like the core
of the industry loves having a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, the entire industry is
rooted in, you know, I mean, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I just don't get sad and smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be happy and smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like that's just not... I would
say it makes most people happy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an uplifting event, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it makes the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe people are in better moods
because of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen it firsthand with the
effects of, you know, from a medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, from people who have like,
you know, seen an ease in symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I'll tell you, when I was at
Spectrum King, I had a boss who had two
[SPEAKER_00]: bad knees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed two knee replacement surgeries
and he wasn't getting them for one reason
[SPEAKER_00]: or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can tell you is that my uncle
here in Michigan makes a salve out of his
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and everybody swears by it and he
sent me some and I gave it to my boss and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, get me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and he's like,
listen, you know, my pain didn't go away
[SPEAKER_00]: completely, but it went from a nine to
like a three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I'm a big fan of,
you know, there's not enough research is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I think we have a stack of
anecdotal proof and we have a stack of,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're starting to need a stack of actual,
you know, white papers and proof on that
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think like, you know, you would
watch Sanjay Gupta on 60 minutes and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a kid that he gets cured of his
seizures from, from THC or CBD or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, any of these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how can you argue with the parent
that wants to keep their kid healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I just, it's, it's so hard
to argue the fact and the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still schedule one is kind of crazy too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I had done that,
that, that, that whole story goes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: like paper mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yellow journalism of like the twenties
and thirties or whatever it was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reefer madness days where they demonized
everything for social or corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: interests, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I, I seem to remember like
historically, wasn't there some period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time where like every American farmer was
required to grow some sort of section of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp on their farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to remember that was a thing like
in the George Washington days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should go back to those ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I, you know,
I mean, smoking it aside, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you get more paper per hectare,
you get oils, you get all sorts of other
[SPEAKER_00]: usable things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remediation for soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact is it produces a lot more oxygen
than trees do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, there's all kinds of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, so from that standpoint,
I think it's, it's a sad state of affairs
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's not enough research,
but as I understand it, if it does go to
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule three, that that will open up the
door for a lot more of that research
[SPEAKER_00]: because the laboratory that can work with
that level of study will now have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, schedule three is a scary thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm all about descheduling,
not rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the last three episodes,
we've talked about the deschedule,
[SPEAKER_01]: not reschedule, because the second you
make it a schedule three drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens to the rec market?
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think there's a lot of
unanswered questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I understand that, you know,
as alcohol and tobacco are controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: substances, we should have it as a
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as like the fact that they want
to turn it into a schedule three drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to deschedule it
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I would say so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason it should have ever been
so in the first place, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so, so yeah, I mean,
from a, from a, to get people to that
[SPEAKER_00]: place where there's consistently,
you know, clean product on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, it's just requiring that you go
to a place of, you know, being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze your environment and being able
to, you know, take small mitigation risks,
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate or eliminate risks within the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that standpoint, you know,
it's not even just about putting a magic
[SPEAKER_00]: box up in the ceiling before you,
you know, operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about, you know, what kind of mops
are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what kind of gowning are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, you know, like, are you
fixing your cracks in your floors and your
[SPEAKER_00]: windows and what have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those types of questions,
like all those other risks that fall under
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny with the filter, we had the
option of either putting it hidden up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ceiling or putting it so that we can
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be able to talk about it when
people come in the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you guys, it's designed to make it
look nice too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the nice part about it is it
does come on, you know, casters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can wheel it around if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have hardware for you to be able to
mount it to the ceiling, mount it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, you know, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, ceiling and floor real
estate in a cultivation facility is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: premium, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to find the balance of the
size of a unit that you can work with that
[SPEAKER_00]: puts out enough airflow for it to be worth
it that, you know, still has efficacy in
[SPEAKER_00]: its process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to, you know, I mean,
full disclosure, you know, we are an H13
[SPEAKER_00]: HEPA filter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: H14 exists, but you lose air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of give and take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like, you know, even going
into the facilities, like just their
[SPEAKER_00]: native HVAC systems, you know,
there's something called the MERV rating
[SPEAKER_00]: system for air filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for minimum efficiency reporting
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is, is it's sort of a standard
expectation of performance for that
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's given a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for example, a MERV 13 filter
will remove 90% of one micron and larger
[SPEAKER_00]: particles, whereas a MERV 8 filter will
only capture about 60% or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, do I have a MERV chart?
[SPEAKER_00]: I might actually have a MERV chart here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, don't you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see it, but here's the
joke of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, or the give and take is the higher you
go up in MERV rating, yeah, you get their
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration performance, but your
mechanicals for your HVAC have to work a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot harder in order to push air through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the efficiency pops out because if your
HVAC system can't support the heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: weighted filter because it can't move the
air through it, you're going to experience
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling capacity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to experience, you know,
stress on your HVAC system, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where filter kind of comes
in to just directly attack the particle
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't cry into HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even suggest it as a bypass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, just you put it in the
room, let it recirculate its own air and
[SPEAKER_00]: let the HVAC do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're basically supplementing the
filtration because, you know, when people
[SPEAKER_00]: are specking in HVAC in their plan,
more often than not, they're factoring for
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling capacity versus, you know,
particle filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, it's like, I'm not
going to tell you to like rip out and
[SPEAKER_00]: replace hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you to put hundreds of thousands
of dollars worth of filters in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm kidding, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I mean, at the end of the day,
though, it's like, you know, not only can
[SPEAKER_00]: you immediately test filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the cool part about versus like
a lot of the other guys that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, the other types of technologies is
that I can put a particle counter on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put a particle counter on the top
and I can demonstrate efficacy in real
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, in fact, wouldn't you know it,
I might actually have that handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm going to be able to do
that, but I'm going to do it.
So you can see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can open this up and share
it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share screen has stopped as the share
windows close.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, we're going to share it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me roll it back here for a second,
just to be in suspense here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a filter unit here and you can
see we put a particle counter on one side
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see those numbers are counting
and you can see the time clock in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom right where it's counting seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show you the rest of the filter unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come to the output with a
particle counter running and all zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can prove that this thing is actually
doing something in real time versus a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of other companies that are out there
that, you know, where you would have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of testing of the room in order to
be able to understand if this thing's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually doing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, my my Bud's past testing is
anecdotal, but not very scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, well, it's a yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a beautiful world we live in
where we can test this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of awakening to like all of
these little facets is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time, while it's cool,
it definitely makes the industry a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more complicated, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, you know,
it's like so many people take pride in
[SPEAKER_00]: their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes you don't necessarily know
if the cleaning that you're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, and a device common in
food manufacturing, it's called an ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You familiar with those?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know what ATP is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adeno triphosphate or something like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andresine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an ATP meter is basically like every
living cell produces bioluminescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like, you know, when you go to the
beach at certain times of year and you
[SPEAKER_00]: kick the water and it turns blue because
of all the algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioluminescent algae or whatever animal or
thing is making that bioluminescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything has a natural level of
bioluminescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ATP meter is like roughly the size
of like a large cell phone, maybe twice as
[SPEAKER_00]: thick about that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes with you buy a bunch of
sticks where you break off the end and you
[SPEAKER_00]: swab it on a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put it in the device and it
spits out a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the what it's calculating is
how much bioluminescence is reflected
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in other words, like, let's say you're
at a cookie factory and you want to test
[SPEAKER_00]: your conveyor belt, you know, you can you
can test it beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get what's called an RLI relative
light indicator, relative light number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with them too deeply,
but you get a number that it spits out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you execute your cleaning SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you test it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see a lower number,
that's a validation that you've cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, a big misconception
is because a lot of people walk into a
[SPEAKER_00]: room and they're like, smells clean,
smells really clean in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, in some cases, that could
just be fragrance that the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabuloso.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it really does take the
ability to, you know, validate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know that cannabis is
necessarily there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pharma manufacturing is very much
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live and die by validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every claim they make, they have to be
able to validate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that and, you know,
following specific like SOPs, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedures are becoming
quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of requests for people to,
you know, from people to write them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know home growers that write SOPs
for themselves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't write SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like high level I do, but like I
don't write SOPs for other people as a
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply because, you know,
when you're you have to observe somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not necessarily like some cookie
cutter way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no boilerplate SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so custom to the individual
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's it's an amazing thing,
too, if you get it down right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's like a million different
ways to do something, the formatting is is
[SPEAKER_00]: where I think that you're going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for instance, is this the SOP
training template?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the SOP training template.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch this madness here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was a while back,
I did a webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on the filter YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was I did a webinar on
building SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And building SOPs from a pharma and food
manufacturing standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took what they do and just put it in
a template that makes everything very easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and we ran through all the different
various parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, in pharma SOP writing,
they have these very specific parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the scope, you know,
which defines where the procedure applies
[SPEAKER_00]: within the overall operation of the
facility, because people want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how does what I'm doing fit into the
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the purpose of doing this thing
this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, any specific definitions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's in charge of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What materials are you going to need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just cleaning materials and equipment,
but like, do you need safety gear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need like ladders and, you know,
extendable poles and what have you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you finally get to the procedure
where you actually list out the steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have references that you want to
include with there, you do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there's a validation
and sign off section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, like cannabis isn't
as huge on validating yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you this, that if it's not
documented, it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I have to tell people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you need to start getting down
on documenting, documenting everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: do, you know, because everything who
cleans the bathroom and when did they
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think those are little things,
but they're super important, believe it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even just necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily from a day to day
operation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you have a recall?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you get sued by an
employee who got hurt at your facility or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that or got sick at your
facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard about a case in Massachusetts,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all kind of got familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had some special nuances to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate that it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, you know,
it's to be able to document everything you
[SPEAKER_00]: did can actually, in fact, provide you a
legal defense in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can sit there and say
like, you know, yes, this happened to this
[SPEAKER_00]: person, but it's not like we've been doing
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this diligent particle monitoring
program, a diligent air sampling program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We document every time we clean something
and every time we change something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at least it gives you some sort
of plausible defense around like versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just you're just growing
backyard boogie indoors and you got my
[SPEAKER_00]: clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't document stuff because
they want plausible deniability as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to do it the right way,
then document it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, then whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But documenting it is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially it doesn't matter
whether you're breeding or whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing tissue culture or whether you're
doing cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to improve what you're doing,
documentation is where it's found.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find the ways in the past to improve
what you're doing through documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who kept a grow journal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kept a grow journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kept a grow journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it was just simply as basic as
you wanted to remember what you did last
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if it worked, you could do it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always changed recipes so
often in the beginning when I was learning
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, I was always changing stuff around
and there were these really complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: recipes and way more than what I would do
now for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're just buying like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 17 different liquids and like most of
them are 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are 95% water anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I will say that simplifying
things, making things easier, MacGyvering
[SPEAKER_00]: your way around things, like just because
I'm telling people to live between food
[SPEAKER_00]: and pharma doesn't necessarily mean you
have to spend pharma money to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean- But you got to have the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have the knowledge to know what
you need to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be able to be willing to
look at yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hold the mirror up to your process
and be willing to go, okay, this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut the ego out and actually look at it,
you know, from an outside perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said that today to a client.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at a site visit earlier today and I
was like, you know, there is a distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of CEO training in this industry,
you know, because I kind of find it
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing sometimes because like I'm seen
as like this like ultra clean guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really in my reality, I'm like,
I'm a pig, but like as soon as I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the facility door, as soon as I get to the
facility door, that's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showered, I'm suited, I'm booted,
I'm Tyvek'd, all my equipment's sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize the risk that I pose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have to be able to live it
because I'm telling my growers limit your
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like all those times you see
like, you know, glamour models going into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivation facilities to do like
marketing photo shoots for their client,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like those classic shots of
like some, you know, hippie girl like
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling the bud in her hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, you have sent down
the microbe's birth wearings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, yeah, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely the killjoy of the industry
sometimes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but at the same time, it's like you
are in a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do business as business is
done, unfortunately, there's some give and
[SPEAKER_00]: take around where your level of fun is
versus where your level of work is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love touching plants with my bare hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not the best thing,
but it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try I've worked really diligently on
wearing gloves most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really enjoy touching plants with
my bare hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what, I'll make you a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can start to deploy a hand
sanitizing regimen before you touch your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I'll allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have hand sanitizing stations all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, I tell you what,
man, we've been taught to wash our our
[SPEAKER_00]: hands since kindergarten, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but we were never really taught
how, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're supposed to say the alphabet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it three times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you what it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say happy birthday twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, here's where it where it gets
interesting is it's not even just the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time that you spend,
the amount of effort and direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're what you're looking at right here
is what's called the aseptic hand washing
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is used in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used in dental offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in pharma clean rooms like it is
considered an aseptic process right for
[SPEAKER_00]: aseptic manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it starts with is your
traditional rubbing your palms together
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're getting the insides of
your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting the insides of your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're you're interlacing your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting the insides of your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting the backs of your
fingernails.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting your thumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting the fingertips.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're getting your wrists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do this little exercise when I do
site visits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes what happens, I'll do a
site visit and I will I'll bring somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I will have them don a pair of
gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, the technical term for putting
on gloves is donning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don our gay apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fa la la la la la.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technical term is doffing to take it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donning, doffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just trivia night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be a beast.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doff Lundgren is what they're going to
call me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oh my God, that's an Instagram post
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so what I'll do is I'll have
somebody come up and I'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to put some hand sanitizer
in your gloved hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dark gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the difference between the dry
and the light and the dry and the wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say wash your hands like you
would normally wash your hands at home or
[SPEAKER_00]: here at work after using the bathroom or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they'll wash their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, OK, now take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see all the dry spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all the spots that didn't get hand
sanitizer on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, now try try this method that
I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it together in front of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, now take a look at your
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely, completely covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just a great way of,
you know, because I mean, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it, like when people grab the
gloves out of the middle of the box,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, like most glove manufacturers lay
their gloves alternate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, and you pull it from the
middle, like Kleenex, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a tissue box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but you're pulling it with
the finger and you're pulling on the part
[SPEAKER_00]: that is invariably potentially going to be
totally contaminating the gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In in pharmaceutical environments and in
medical environments and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: their gloves come individually wrapped and
they're locked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so that way they could just slip
into and put them on one at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, with that, it's like,
you know, those little changes and about
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that barrier between people who,
you know, because again, it's like humans
[SPEAKER_00]: are oftentimes the problem until robots
are starting to be able to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which we don't want to happen
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're never going to get the same
level of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking that turpless robot weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so so yeah, I mean,
that makes me a big, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: germ nerd to the industry, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the people that watch my show are
going to love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The viewers out there are going to really
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to do, you know, we could do
a seminar one of these days together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you wanted to assemble your
your your audience together in one place,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe we can run through it like a
co-hosted type of co-branded type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you know, and you just leave it out
on the on the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to know this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just they don't know where to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's, you know, and that's where
I want to try to be of help, because when
[SPEAKER_00]: you better understand the problem,
the solution makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see or hear, the kids are
calling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really appreciate you coming on
the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody wants to find out more about
you, where can they get a hold of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can always reach me,
you know, via Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm under dyslexic stoner 402.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with that in mind,
