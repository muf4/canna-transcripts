[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here at Reggae in the River with
Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, Marlon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hot, but you know, I'm fine,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at Reggae on the River, we're ready
for the performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blessing, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been getting me to Reggae shows
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one, this one, I hope is going
to be the epic one because I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reggae on the River has been missing for a
while and it's back and we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people were juiced to come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The camp situation is crazy, too,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here ready for the performance.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Rick from Royal Gold at
Reggae on the River 2024.
[SPEAKER_12]: Amazing event.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the first day.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty wild already.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just heating up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Day one, first time back here in seven
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously, this thing has been going
for over three decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is a big family reunion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's coming back to the spot that
they love.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got memories.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's talking about yesterday year
and the things that have happened and the
[SPEAKER_08]: music that they've listened to and the
great things that they've experienced
[SPEAKER_08]: around music around Humboldt County and
around the amazing plant cannabis.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all have great Reggae stories from the
past.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to sleep on the rocks one year.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was an experience.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the music.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's so sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is 100 percent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This as we get older, we notice we're
bringing camping pads and even pillows.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, when you're younger,
I definitely have that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I came down here where it was like,
yeah, the rock was the pillow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like that song, you know,
tough it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have an amazing weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they've done a great job,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just setting everything up.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that they positioned everybody,
all the vendors, all the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very community based.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've kind of put everybody together
where depending on what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're doing food, obviously,
those guys are always together in a food
[SPEAKER_08]: zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's kind of nice between
like the jewelry, the clothing,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you got the more cultivating
based companies all kind of in a zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just, yeah, it just feels
familiar.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just feels like a big family reunion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's like coming home, seeing your
friends that you haven't seen for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Luckily, we get to see each other more
often.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm stoked that you came out, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked about this, obviously,
you know, six months ago or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were on for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was on for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we mentioned this afterwards.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's one of those things, you know,
sometimes you can mention something like
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man, Reagan, the river is going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should come up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of times people will just say,
oh, yeah, it sounds like a great idea,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it won't happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: A week later, you hit me up and you were
like, man, I really actually want to come
[SPEAKER_08]: up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to take you up on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great opportunity to not
just do podcasting and get out there and
[SPEAKER_08]: talk to our audience, but to get back into
the roots and like the magic that
[SPEAKER_08]: surrounded us in regards to this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we go more commercially.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we go more legal, things are changing,
man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's very, very important for us to
remember where we came from and the magic
[SPEAKER_08]: that happened in these hills, you know,
these mountains, the why we're here now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we all cut our teeth with
this plant, you know, 30, 40 years ago for
[SPEAKER_08]: some of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's important, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about coming back, being a part
of the cannabis community here in Southern
[SPEAKER_08]: Humboldt County in the Emerald Triangle
and giving back and sharing and all that
[SPEAKER_12]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great because you meet the nicest
people here, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like everybody's in a good mood.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's more cannabis consumed
than alcohol, which plays a huge role like
[SPEAKER_12]: the people tuning in rather than tuning
out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that there's anything wrong with a
couple of beers or anything.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's always great.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I feel like people here are tuned in
and it's great to be around a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_12]: of people that are tuned in to what's
going on and happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just just in general, even though whatever
is going on at home is going on at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're here, you're here and it's
just an amazing feeling to be around
[SPEAKER_08]: people that are just so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 percent, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You couldn't have said that any better
because back in the day when this has
[SPEAKER_08]: always pretty much gone on the first
weekend of August.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was it was almost like a
celebration of you're you're you're done
[SPEAKER_08]: with with planting and really kind of
getting into the everything set up in your
[SPEAKER_08]: garden.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're just about to go into the into
the real part of Grumple County and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything flips where the copters were
going to start flying.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was about to get real.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's gather.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's celebrate each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plant, the music, because these next
couple of months you might even still be
[SPEAKER_12]: sexing plants like this time of year
outdoors if you're growing regular seeds.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the time of year.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, plants are big.
[SPEAKER_12]: The bigger ones show their sex early on
typically, but you'll still get some.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've all been caught off guard.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, seed companies have been built
off of that, you know, big time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, man, it's it's really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, everybody being in a
good mood.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's it's where we're at right now
where people, you know, post covid.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that was a traumatic thing
for people like us, our tribe,
[SPEAKER_08]: our culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: We gather.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to circle up and ceremony.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in those years, man, it was really
difficult for us to sort of get back to
[SPEAKER_08]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And where we can actually share and all
the good things that we love and why we've
[SPEAKER_08]: all been drawn to each other over the
decades, man, it feels like we're going
[SPEAKER_12]: through a lot of trauma just in life.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, in existence, there's trauma,
covid, whatever happens, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: over the period of your life, that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: These type of events are good for that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, they're the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think being able to get around other
people in this nice warm weather,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, I listen to some good music at
the end of the day, the music really kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of just ties it all in together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we're here for the music.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're here for all of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then the music just elevates it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: It elevates the whole experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited about the lineup.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some really dear friends in the band
Checkered Past.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're dear friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played music with them personally
over the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just it's a it's a new twist on
ska music, which I'm a big fan of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Growing up in New York City, I got turned
on a sky in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people laugh at Scott.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just think it's like a funny corky
thing to be into.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scott music is the most outlifting,
happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's fucking dance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put that shit on a Sunday when I'm ready
to clean my house.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: The tires with reggae and ska.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the roots of it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before reggae, there was ska.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's Checkered Past.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to check them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not on the main stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're one of the side stages tomorrow,
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, you got Kableton,
you got Sister Nancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_08]: Super pumped to see Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaybug.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaybug.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping Jaybug and Marlon go up and
perform together.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go way back with Marlon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So put in your little elbow rub to see me
make that happen, because that would be
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be an amazing end to Sunday
night.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the music.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've got multiple stages.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got DJs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nicky T's here, DJing.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no end to the fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of good booths here,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cutting edge right next to you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Turd Mansion right across from
us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got this little entryway into the
Cannabis Zone, which is super fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of us go way back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've known each other for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're sitting in the big tent for
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is run by Steve Gieter,
who's an old school Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_08]: entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had Gro's Stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been throwing on the Cannabis
festivals for years, getting the people
[SPEAKER_08]: together from the Emerald Tridle and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's done an extraordinary job over the
last two and a half decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here he is.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're under the Cannabis tent,
here rigging the river.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's throwing his own Cannabis in
September, first weekend of September.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scratch that second weekend of September,
7th and 8th.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's on the waterfront in Eureka.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got a great lineup.
[SPEAKER_08]: More drifting away from Grateful
Dead-esque or reggae, but more Grateful
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead kind of with lettuce, with O'Teal and
friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got Melvin Seals from JGB band.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a great, great lineup.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jude Festival right on the waterfront.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll both be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be filming there, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to do some more podcast stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_12]: Get you out there again and we'll talk
some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tempt me with a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll be smoking some good weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Roo from Roo's Goofy Growing
and the Seed to Harvest podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing today, Roo?
[SPEAKER_12]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, we're here rigging the river.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're smoking a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoying the festivities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've been enjoying them since before
they even started.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's been good.
[SPEAKER_12]: So this all started with a phone call that
we got about two months ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was like, man, I think I mentioned
going to Reagan.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're like, I like Reagan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you want to go?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, you know, you're on the right
path when shit just starts happening for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When shit falls into place, you know
you're on the right path.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I always believe squeak will gets
the oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's the worst that could
happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: He just says, all right, I'll see you
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you said, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got my money for a flight.

[SPEAKER_12]: As far as variety, we're going to see tons
of everything.

right now that are fresh.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love those.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's good indoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's good hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's good everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're smoking some Flora and Flame,
Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_12]: That Rosin is next level, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best stuff we've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that stuff is the flavor we're
getting off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked some White Thor Rose a little
bit ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to try White Thor Rose for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, like you said, that is a good,
make you feel good, strength.
[SPEAKER_12]: It just makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's good.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like it's not too strong.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not too weak either.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like what's how you kind of
imagine it be like when you get high for
[SPEAKER_03]: like high school.
[SPEAKER_03]: That good vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That you check a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a warm hug for your ancestors.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it feels like to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but this, and what else did we
smoke?

[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like to smoke this weekend?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking to maybe try some of your
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been trying those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm always looking for a good Sativa.
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get reception.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they'll do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so it's a blessing and a curse.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to communicate with friends,
put stories on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to be disconnected.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm 100% on board with the phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working and I'm going to be OK for the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to really enjoy my friends and
not tune into the phone too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you get to tune everything out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's getting to disconnect for a little
bit every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's for taking photos.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can post on Monday or whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much to absorb in the next
weekend as far as different experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all have the poster right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can post later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be in the moment, capture it,

[SPEAKER_12]: Canterfest 10 is going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got an event next month.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be going to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to be doing the same kind of
setup where we do little interviews and
[SPEAKER_03]: have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sounds like a great time,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I was going to that.

bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to get him out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, hell yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got all of these.

they have the event, we go and we invite
[SPEAKER_12]: one new person.
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So next year, Al Canisour.

singles out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Vital and Royal Gold are my two go-to's.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I want to try them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try to get like a good,
like a seven gallon fabric pot going with
[SPEAKER_03]: some organic something, soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And their tupperware is really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything they make is really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good company.

genuine and they're from up in this area.
[SPEAKER_12]: A whole bunch of passionate people.
[SPEAKER_12]: People work for the company.

[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Lance from Turplok.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, from Grove.
[SPEAKER_12]: He makes the Turplok.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my favorite things of the whole
world, especially to cure, you guys maybe
[SPEAKER_12]: get rid of a whole bunch of glass
containers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I still use mine for salsa.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I put the Turplok in the glass containers.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you don't get smashed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like we used to do things
in a different way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now with the modern advances,
you guys have kind of changed the curing
[SPEAKER_12]: game completely.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys have been hooking me up with
Turploks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And dude, like I've been giving them out
to our customers.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're supposed to buy seeds.
Sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we did that collab at Corado.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice little surprise.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we have another something up
our sleeve on the horizon here.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's been sweet.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've been great to us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we love being great to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Introduce a couple of friends from Alaska
that need some latest, greatest gents.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we got you caught up with a spannibus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Catch up with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Missed you in Berlin, though.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: My God, Mary Jane was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was hand watering.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the real hand watering.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got someone taking care of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: My game's got the time now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I work on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, I fill in on the weekends for my
guys so they can have the weekends off.
[SPEAKER_12]: Typically, we now have one guy that has to
work out Saturdays with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have the best staff ever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, honestly, I don't have the best fire
ever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're fiending 60 lights right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have a ton of new fire,
new different stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: 20% of the stuff in the room is completely
weird and strange and old school or
[SPEAKER_12]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: That 80% is like the candy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I love it all.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm smoking on some Super Silver Haze
this weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to give that a try.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I like what you're talking about
because, to your point, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: guys, especially, like you said,
with the dessert cultivars, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: All these cakes and pies and all the candy
straight and so on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how you get into the weirds.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, to your point, not a lot of people
are chasing Super Silver Haze or Lemon
[SPEAKER_11]: Haze or Headband.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know how big that is in Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you and I both go over there and
it's still relevant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's still very relevant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tangy is relevant to Hashform over there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They love the Tangy Hash, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_12]: The really good Moroccan Tangy Hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not the hugest Tangy flower guy,
but I do really love it in Hashform.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting how you get that.
[SPEAKER_11]: What about, what are you ripping on the
Fresh Rose?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you doing A Live right now?
[SPEAKER_12]: So House of Kultumar is actually doing a
bunch of stuff with my genetics or our
[SPEAKER_12]: genetics that I've worked with Jason
Hinojuan.
[SPEAKER_12]: But they're doing some of that for a game.
[SPEAKER_12]: Grape Soda and Grape Gas Crosses that I
made.
[SPEAKER_12]: And some of the apples and banana stuff
that I did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just coming out phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I bet.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been smoking the live, live in the
fucking, uh, the rosin, the Donnie that
[SPEAKER_12]: works for the government.
[SPEAKER_12]: He makes this amazing rosin and it's just
like candy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I have some fluoride flame.
[SPEAKER_12]: We could probably smoke it right now if
you want to try some rosin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm always down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything you bring is fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that goes without saying, but yeah,
a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: So.
[SPEAKER_11]: Flora and flame.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, this is their rosin and it's Donnie
burger.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and it's maybe the best Donnie burger
I've ever saw.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the stuff that makes me just want to
smoke more.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the terms on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just push on the button.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a little bit on there.
[SPEAKER_12]: This will probably get a nice fat hit.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is tasty.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like candy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like candy popcorn tasting,
like in a good way.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the negative side of popcorn.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, not really sweet, but just that
bright kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's like right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it hits.
[SPEAKER_12]: It hits really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, October 1st, I'm doing a Dabadoo.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you're available to come
to the Dabadoo.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no way.
Cisco.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got, uh, any good TV.
[SPEAKER_12]: Marlin's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think SF Kano will have some
representation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can it was Chris would probably be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a special event.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't do events.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got some amazing sponsors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's going to have the most amazing
extractive smoke.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we're going to have a belt for the
award.
[SPEAKER_12]: No way.
[SPEAKER_12]: We belt.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a one time thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you grow with WWF when you're,
when you're bringing a belt to the table.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fight.
[SPEAKER_11]: I definitely doubt anything that you
touch.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, you, you've been absolutely
killing it as far as the genetics game.
[SPEAKER_11]: Been a long time fan because again,
you geek out on the rare stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a huge respect for land race.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you geek out on the more unique and
special things, not just the, the trending
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I sometimes think that with the market,
we were stuck on this one thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That doesn't mean we can't try to sneak
things in to get people interested in
[SPEAKER_12]: other things where they're like,
Oh yeah, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got the look.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got the smell or maybe it has
something unique about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, like it's exactly true.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you hear, and you know this,
I'm sure I have friends up here on the
[SPEAKER_11]: hill that they're sneaking sour D back in.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're bringing blue diamond back in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they're bringing some of these.
[SPEAKER_11]: These fun things from kind of circa
nineties, 2000, a lot of this stuff is
[SPEAKER_12]: just reoccurring.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like Donnie burger is supposed to be,
it's like an S one of GMO.
[SPEAKER_12]: GMO is basically a stronger version of
chem D.
[SPEAKER_12]: So really you're getting the evolution of
chem, chem doc, like chem doc D in my
[SPEAKER_12]: opinion is what all this stuff is.
[SPEAKER_12]: It came from there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we can recognize that and we can
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's special for somebody that's been
smoking as long as they have to be able to
[SPEAKER_12]: see the evolution.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't feel special, but I really feel
special being part of this bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's so amazing that we're here and
we're part of this thing too.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, I think it's a mentality
you and I both carry like for us and not
[SPEAKER_11]: to not, I mean, there's some people that
are so busy building their name and
[SPEAKER_11]: building their brand and they already
doesn't escape me that it's James cloud
[SPEAKER_11]: genetics, but you've never made it about
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like me.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always been an us and we,
not denying me.
[SPEAKER_11]: And like you get that, which again,
I think that's why you're having success
[SPEAKER_11]: on the global stage.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like seeing friends of mine from the Czech
Republic and from Italy and from Germany
[SPEAKER_11]: coming up to your booth and span of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like, dude, this is the book I need.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the book I want.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that's fricking sick.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even tell you, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I read very James had a friend flying from
Austria.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually this guy's buddies with him.
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy had just met.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's listening to your podcast with James
loud on the flight over.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, dude, he's like that guy's
killing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like a hundred percent because he
cares about this community, not just about
[SPEAKER_11]: the industry and where it's going,
you know, so you got it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just had fun with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a good team that I work with and
it's like, they make me live better.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just, it's a group effort and
it's like, it's also the group we're
[SPEAKER_12]: highlighting the guest, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're highlighting the guests and I get
the most amazing stories for people that I
[SPEAKER_12]: love that some of our guests are just,
some of the guests I think that are going
[SPEAKER_12]: to be like, okay, they might, it could go
either either way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes they just knock it out of
the park.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like Julie from sky
magazine was, I mean, I love Julie.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been friends for a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love John too from a stud back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when Julie came on the show,
she just moved the first 30 minutes of our
[SPEAKER_12]: interview.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of like how our interview
went.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got the same vibe, but like she had a
lot to say and she said it, it's such a
[SPEAKER_12]: precise way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was so amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just never know when you're going to
get those moments with people in their
[SPEAKER_12]: life where when you're interviewing,
they hit it out of the park.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been fortunate enough with some
of these guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had, uh, Jimmy came on from Meyers
Creek genetics Meyers Creek, brought the
[SPEAKER_11]: GDP to the market, right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I love.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just invested in Operation Down South
and we found a rogue Harlequin promise
[SPEAKER_11]: with GDP.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely fired.
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, did you have a really eclectic,
I don't know, I watch it all the time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you bring on such an eclectic,
so many that have odd cast are trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: just go for, the cloud guys are the
obnoxious guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: The ones who are really trying to put
themselves front there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have like this total, like I'm dating
myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a Benetton commercial from the
eighties, like just such a variety of
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's what's cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to tell a story with the
podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the story of cannabis in the modern
time in the last 40 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's happened?
[SPEAKER_12]: How did he, how did we get here?
[SPEAKER_12]: And so to tell a story properly,
you need as many opinions as possible
[SPEAKER_12]: because the more opinions you have,
the more stories you have, you can put
[SPEAKER_12]: together this beautiful picture,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the end of this, the end of my life,
we'll have put together this amazing
[SPEAKER_12]: story, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's so much bigger than just myself or
any one of the guests.
[SPEAKER_12]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's all of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all of our stories and then my
contributing, I just am like so blessed to
[SPEAKER_11]: be part of this fucking amazing thing and
part of my friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can see it turned into a
documentary, to be honest, because you and
[SPEAKER_11]: I both have lived through, I just,
just told one of these guys here,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, right down the river during
cannabis activation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, yeah, this is my, now actually
it's my 200th trade show exporter event.
[SPEAKER_11]: The cannabis industry is like,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, dude, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's just so many and so much
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen so much over the years,
but to your point, like some time it has
[SPEAKER_11]: to be a documentary, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: To be honest, even for California.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember, man, like 1990 with Prop P,
1996 with 215, 2016 with 64.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: This, this state's been through a lot on
legalization.
[SPEAKER_11]: You and I have been through that entire
ride.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that itself is such a crazy story,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so wild.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just great.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a great time to be alive.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when you start going deeper into
like, what's the, what's your purpose
[SPEAKER_12]: here?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, I feel like I don't want my
purpose.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a great feeling to be like,
okay, I serve my purpose for whatever that
[SPEAKER_12]: was.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like I'm serving a purpose that's
what's going to go myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we're all a part of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just like this catalyst for our
guests.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really think you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: You balance a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's the thing, like you just
talked about earlier, but I, I remember
[SPEAKER_11]: you remember another funny story.
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about our podcast over in
mutual, uh, buddies at Rosenthal's house.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we smoked through everything I
brought, everything I grew and brought
[SPEAKER_11]: along.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we bust out a bag, I mean,
straight out of our youth, man,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was like mom's sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, God, this smells like fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: This looks like fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, where'd you get this?
[SPEAKER_11]: I got it from James.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, in this bag?
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: And get me used to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's how I came up with the,
doing the collab with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's those kinds of stories,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people don't understand it's such a
tight niche network.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, you and I are even more unique
in that, that network spans
[SPEAKER_11]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we have mutual friends everywhere out
Europe, Australia.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everywhere I run into guys who are like,
Oh, I'm messing with James Gen X here,
[SPEAKER_11]: back East.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just share with you on IG, buddy of mine
that you're working with back East.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, my God, he's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you are doing, I think you're in the
perfect place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that it's working out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's a struggle right now for
some people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm pretty happy with where I'm at
right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's, it's, it's a great place.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like, it is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Life is a struggle.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we make it through the hard times and
then the times get better.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's more hard times in the
future, but then they get better.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, you know, this industry is
amazing though.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, uh, right when you think,
and the thing with Turblock is like,
[SPEAKER_12]: you're another reason that I still believe
in new things because when you think
[SPEAKER_12]: you're going to figure it out,
I'm old, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not old, old, but we're a bit of a gen
Xers.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I feel like I've figured it all out,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that's when, like, I thought I'd
figure it out with lighting and I didn't
[SPEAKER_12]: need LED if they were garbage,
the blur balls, whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now LEDs are the fucking, they've improved
them to an amazing, to an amazing degree.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now with other canopies and all these
things, but Turblocks it's like right when
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought I knew how to cure weed
completely, a long coat of something that
[SPEAKER_12]: makes me go, fuck, I, I could have done it
differently and this makes the product
[SPEAKER_12]: better, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I have friends that hate the trim brush.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the trim brush.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a huge trimmer, figure trimmer and
trim brush.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you rough guy like me, I noticed with
your bud, huge props to you, man,
[SPEAKER_11]: because yeah, there are some things that
may be a little bit better trim that came
[SPEAKER_11]: out of the eighties.
[SPEAKER_11]: But like, but it's not one of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love, there's plenty of trikes on those
sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love how you don't over manicure your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I'm a stay away.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice and velvety.
[SPEAKER_11]: Velvety, they give me smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to make it harsh.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the technology and that's what you
probably noticed this as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we do love about the
international market is we aren't talking
[SPEAKER_11]: to people that think they know everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, Hey, you're from NorCal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, you've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you've probably come a long way with
some of the things you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I go, yeah, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the friends that send in your
way of spam.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, Oh, you want like genetics?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're on top of our genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at what James allowed at.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's people out there, but it seems
like to your point internationally,
[SPEAKER_11]: they are more like us.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're open to this being an
evolution, not a revolution in evolution.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: While some others, and it is again,
we're so symptomatic with domestic
[SPEAKER_11]: growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went into, you know, been there,
done that, but doing it since I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_11]: I know everything I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, well, things are constantly
changing, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely cool stuff, dude.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just don't have to catch up up
there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely always, always a pleasure,
man, to catch up with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to come do another podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to get, we got to get your boy here
on the show, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to get, he jokes around about
being my, uh, he's, he's only seven years
[SPEAKER_11]: younger, eight years younger than me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm his uncle, evidently with the same
last name.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep the Lambert strong in the,
in the, uh, business here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Emerald cup is coming up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, I think we're going to run up the
way for that.
Maybe.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting a true block tattoo.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were talking about the, I'm getting a
true black tattoo on my chest.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is real.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing but the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing but the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: Represent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for advertising.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're headed for life.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Anunaki, who's performing at
Reggae on the River 2024 on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for coming on this interview.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, you're the first, you're the first
artist I'm interviewing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good friends with Marlon Asher.
[SPEAKER_12]: We, we're going to get some good footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think of reggae?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this your first reggae on the river?
First.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first reggae on the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say is a wonderful vibes
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what part of Jamaica are you from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm from St. Mary, you know,
between Kingston and Ocho Rios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm frequently in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like every day, every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Ocho Rios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like Ocho Rios?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went there 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 years ago?
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to come forward, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: I even went to, I went to church in Ocho
Rios on the hill.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was staying at a resort and they invited
me to go to church and they said there's a
[SPEAKER_12]: reggae band and I said, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a reggae band.
[SPEAKER_12]: As the sun was coming up at dawn,
they had church service on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was the most beautiful, amazing
services I've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live 20 minutes away from Ocho Rios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live nearby the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing a Airbnb there right now,
like a healing center too.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm out here promoting my
music and these initiatives to get people
[SPEAKER_00]: really involved too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're seeking business partners to
really bring forth this joyful thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we call bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's too much war and violence
in the world right now, so we have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can do as activists to put things
in place, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the consciousness alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica is an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a mix of strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I make genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you say mixed strains,
we are Jamaican, we know the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you mix it, is it still natural?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it still not?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I made genetics for St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going with Marlon later this year to
St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to present to the Minister of
Agriculture a collection of seeds that we
[SPEAKER_12]: made specifically for them with a banana
cross.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of the island and their history
with bananas, I went there and talked
[SPEAKER_12]: about cannabis with Marlon in 2018 and 19.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I promised that I was going to make
genetics and bring it to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: This year we're coming through with our
promise.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're bringing banana crosses.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have 20 different banana crosses we're
gifting to the country, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: That can be for the country, for the
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're meant to give out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Life is about giving back.
[SPEAKER_12]: This culture and community is about giving
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your genetics is a seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do seeds and I do clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're giving away, say you're
going to Jamaica or Trinidad or Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're giving away the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving away the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give the seeds to the people.
[SPEAKER_12]: We give clean seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: We test our seeds, making sure they don't
have any virus or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So everything is tested and pathogen
claimed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that's good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all big guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that strange call?
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a Sour Diesel Times Girl Scout
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so one of these is a girl scout
cookie.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, that one tastes more like Super
Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Super Silver.
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Haze.
[SPEAKER_12]: The 1997 Super Silver Haze cut.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's that flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes good, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you need an Adonaki strain in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a Lamb's Bread cost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have some seeds from Orange Hill
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lamb's Bread and Orange Hill, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a good cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody's done that yet
either that I know of.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I love both of those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have an ex sativa down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it original maca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's kind of fine, but it's
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the original sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get that strain, that would
have been good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's Jamaica's special place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a giant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you grow flax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a mixture of, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to be here in Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to be here in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my connection to the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, with Reggae.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been bringing me to Reggae.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to go to Reggae shows in the 90s
before I knew him.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maritime Hall in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to go to Reggae shows in the 90s
before I knew him.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I go around with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernie Spears from St. Todd too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from like a parish near St. Mary.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm from St. Mary, Bernie Spears from
St. Todd.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the most amazing musicians have
come out of Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to doubt, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the ones, them right now,
we're really keeping that energy alive,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that spiritual energy alive in the
western hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think so many amazing artists
come out of Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_12]: You think it's partially the struggle and
the ones that have made it past the
[SPEAKER_12]: struggle and they can sing about it?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The struggle is a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the culture too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bloodline itself,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, black people and the whole world is
more leaning towards art and culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tuned in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the culture of Rastafari too is a big
influence on why so much artists come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Jamaica.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it wasn't for really Rastafari
and this music called reggae music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a wonderful work and that
really make I can be here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Marley, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Touch, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same Burning Spear, all of these ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they paved the way for everyone
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names Lonky and Coleman, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a joy, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be here as a younger generation carry
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: To carry the torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot, I feel like there's a
lot of responsibility with something like
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think there's so much importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why for me failure is not an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't fail.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to get the real connection to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like when we connect with the eye
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to go around and get the right
connection to the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, make the thing flourish.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were just talking about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're on the right path,
things fall into place.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like we're here today because of
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of us, serendipitously.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's amazing when you're on the
right path, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when you know what you're
supposed to be doing on this planet,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you have that connection,
like it's not about yourself, but when you
[SPEAKER_12]: figure out where you fit into this whole
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the purpose.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your purpose-driven life is the most
important thing, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And music, I work in cannabis,
but both music and cannabis make the world
[SPEAKER_12]: a better place.
[SPEAKER_12]: And of all this, we're contributing to a
better world.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of responsibility with
that, but like we're just doing the best
[SPEAKER_12]: we can do.
[SPEAKER_12]: We put it out there and it's pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's agile, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's agile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the power, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's agile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Steve at Reggae on the River
2024 from... Steve's from Cannefax.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's putting on an event in about a month.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to be there.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, Steve?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's real good to meet you finally in
person here too.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's nice doing that here in the shade
out here at Reggae.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got this nice big tent.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to Steve Beth's official
lounge over here.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're kicking back.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some retailers.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some farmers, some makers,
some of the finest hash and rosin and
[SPEAKER_12]: norkaus and finest flour with our blood
bar and the dab bars over here and just
[SPEAKER_12]: chilling out.
[SPEAKER_12]: We made this little spot to kick back and
chat with some folks.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have an amazing event coming up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you tell us a little bit about
Cannefest?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannefest was born in 2016.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time we ran it a few times at
our local fairgrounds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they changed laws about how we
could do the events.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we had to get... So we waited a few
years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then during COVID, we couldn't really
do events in California.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're like, let's take this thing on
the road like we intended to run it
[SPEAKER_12]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we went out to Chicago and St. Louis
and Oklahoma City.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then last year was the first time we
had Cannefest again in Humboldt since
[SPEAKER_12]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was a great, you know, cannabis
family reunion, I would say.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm a big fan of Cannecon.
[SPEAKER_12]: My friend Dave Messford, who recently
passed on 420, was one of the founding
[SPEAKER_12]: guys with Cannecon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I love the evolution of the
cannabis cup, whether it's Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_12]: high types, cannabis cup, the evolution of
what it's turned into is really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's also turned into things like
Reagan on the river there and continuing
[SPEAKER_12]: the legacy now that we can have a smoking
area.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we just brought this whole zone
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all regulated.
[SPEAKER_12]: The DCC was here being with us today and
all this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just making sure people do whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Waiting for their envelopes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Know what they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, and it's just a community
event up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannabis is a bigger thing to our
community up here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really an experience of generational
kind of thing and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it totally makes the world a better
place and we can all agree on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Brings a lot of good people together.
[SPEAKER_12]: All the people I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you look at the generations,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We have this, I'm a little older now,
and we have this up and coming generation
[SPEAKER_12]: of passionate cannabis enthusiasts,
people that have grew up with the plan for
[SPEAKER_12]: the time they were born.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_12]: With technology and the plan.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think they're going to be carrying
the torch eventually.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we put the torch in our logo this
year for CannabFest because we really
[SPEAKER_12]: believe that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's kind of what our community is
doing right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming together.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like we're going through a cannabis
renaissance.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I really do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's bringing some of the real heads
together to navigate the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's really how it is.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of things that have
shifted.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, concerts in general,
festivals, and then the whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: world kind of got turned around the last
few years, I would say.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're trying to represent the
future of bringing that together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're bringing this whole thing to
other events for one of our full
[SPEAKER_12]: festivals.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a beautiful thing carrying on
a legacy of something that's so much
[SPEAKER_12]: bigger than ourselves on all levels with
the stuff that people are doing now.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think there's still proud of your
pushes.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's people still changing the game,
trying to make a better plan, a better
[SPEAKER_12]: product for the end user, something that's
more special that has different flavors or
[SPEAKER_12]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what got me into this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I started growing my own herbs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: When I was like 16, I grew a few plants
and put them out in the back of the
[SPEAKER_12]: ballpark where I grew up playing baseball
and whatnot, because I learned about
[SPEAKER_12]: compost.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that the soil was active and super
rich.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought if I was going to plant some
weed in the woods and not have to go back
[SPEAKER_12]: to it as often, I needed to find some soil
that was rich, could hold a lot of
[SPEAKER_12]: moisture and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was learning about that at
school.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they've been dumping all these leaf
piles, but sweeping all the streets
[SPEAKER_12]: outside of Philly.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the back of the park, they'd have been
dumping this shit for 50, 60 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there were some compost piles at the
far end of that that were just,
[SPEAKER_12]: I planted my first plants there and the
light came on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I moved to California right when
they started writing scripts and I was
[SPEAKER_12]: growing my own weed in my house.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like as soon as I moved to California,
I was like, oh, okay, now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have this little insurance card.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I opened my own grow shop.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been helping people grow for over
23 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then doing the wholesale stuff,
but producing this whole community events,
[SPEAKER_12]: it's kind of like that's why true love.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for sure, that's kind of where it all
comes together.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where I'm spending my time right
now, mostly.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the collective consciousness,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like all this effort from people in these
different directions all coming together
[SPEAKER_12]: and events like this happening and events
like yours that are happening and how it
[SPEAKER_12]: ties into the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was worried at the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm 77 and we're 76 here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're basically the same age,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I'm a dragon.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, same, same.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fire dragon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Scorpio dragon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know the last, the tail end of it
in 77.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause we're trying to do your ends.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, dude, we're in a special time
because when we grew up, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_12]: popular.
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't the popular opinion that
cannabis is okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a small group of people that said,
no, it is okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to get a jail for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to do whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the kids today are being brought up in
a world that's normalizing it slowly,
[SPEAKER_12]: but surely.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Way different than when we were younger
and people were getting 32 year,
[SPEAKER_12]: a hundred year prison sentences.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we even like Richard DeLizzi served 32
years of a hundred year sentence.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's a different world and it's,
it's way more open.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can be able to attract more people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so many people have found the medicine
because of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we can talk about other things like
this podcast all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can like pop up now in the middle of
Reggae on the river where everybody's been
[SPEAKER_12]: smoking weed forever.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's almost an interesting scenario
being here at Reggae with like the legal
[SPEAKER_12]: weed scene in the like heart of the outlaw
cannabis culture.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's like originally it was like,
well, I don't know how people are going to
[SPEAKER_12]: react to like legal weed in the space.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then our whole community is so rooted
in what the future of cannabis looks like.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have like legends of the past.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's rooted in what the future can be
truly.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, it's undiscovered.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like the potential is so great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows what's going to happen,
but the potential is so great.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the direction.
[SPEAKER_12]: The trajectory is going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end of the day, a hundred years
from now, cannabis will fully be
[SPEAKER_12]: normalized.
[SPEAKER_12]: You won't have any of the haters like we
do now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to be so haters or whatever,
but it won't be the same, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: People will understand it a lot more.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, especially not growing up in a
world where they criminalized it and they
[SPEAKER_12]: made it, they made us outlaws.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: When we were, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about a plant here that they
turned all of us into outlaws and said we
[SPEAKER_12]: were bad.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now that's changing over that we're
normal people too.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like as long as you're not
hurting anybody, what's the harm?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you should be able to say you should
have the freedom.
[SPEAKER_12]: You should have the freedom to consume
things that don't hurt other people.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, obviously you don't want stuff
that could potentially harm somebody,
[SPEAKER_12]: but at the same time, like we should have
the right to use plant medicine too.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just a, it's just a crazy thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just a plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's such a special plant that it
competes in the market with all these
[SPEAKER_12]: pharmaceuticals and they're going to have
to accept it.
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_12]: We use plant medicine for thousands of
years, you know, and we need to go back to
[SPEAKER_12]: it because when you talk about homeostasis
and the body being in optimal condition,
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis can be a big part of that,
whether it's neurologically or physically.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd say it's special.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, uh, it's been bringing people
together around the vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, people start vibing out on
their, it makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_12]: It totally makes the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_12]: Events like this make my life a better
place.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then being able to, like you're
saying, talk about this on here and do
[SPEAKER_12]: this cannabis thing out loud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Something that we love, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: To be able to just speak about it to the
world.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's, it's just, we don't have
to be in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: In 2015, we did the Yes We Can community
parade.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we said it was Humboldt's first
cannabis parade.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only, the person only,
and we've done it a few times since.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do it again this, this year for
Cannifest.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: On the Sunday morning, we come march it
through town and it's a cannabis pride
[SPEAKER_12]: parade.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first time we did this,
we had a whole, a whole crew of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wrote all these affirmations kind of
like, you know, out of the shade and into
[SPEAKER_12]: the light, you know, and really it is
about being proud of something and have it
[SPEAKER_12]: did not hide what you care so much about
or necessarily they looked at in a way
[SPEAKER_12]: that doesn't even align with what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, it makes the world a better place at
the end of the day, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just such a positive thing that a lot
of us find comfort in it.
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of us, you know, our social network
is built around it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I feel like it's a, it's a
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this whole community was built
around it on the shoulders of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely right here at the heart of
Reagan on the river.
[SPEAKER_12]: That couldn't be more true.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like this whole, this whole venue
here at the Matil community center and the
[SPEAKER_12]: other businesses that make this happen and
support what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all built on the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I feel like if you look at the
community, if the feeds the community,
[SPEAKER_12]: right, the trickle down economics within
the community, uh, where it goes down,
[SPEAKER_12]: where, how, how it's supposed to work in,
in the real world, which it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: But in this community, it does.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause these people, feed the other people
in the community.
[SPEAKER_12]: They buy stuff from the other people in
the community.
[SPEAKER_12]: We all support each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like the cannabis industry is
really good and humbled even more.
[SPEAKER_12]: So with everywhere within, within the
money, the cash system is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been here for 20, I lived in rumble
for 24 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't take long to figure out what was
going on as far as, you know, I opened up
[SPEAKER_12]: a gross store and I didn't even know
anybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you have to talk about tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_12]: I did.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean I used to go and that is
Berkeley in regard.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to say tomato garden.
[SPEAKER_12]: They were a great customer and a client
and friends and supporters of us for
[SPEAKER_12]: years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Alison garden was something that,
uh, we brought to the U S and,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, from Holland.
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought let's connect a humbled in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are they using for nutrients over
there?
[SPEAKER_12]: And just tapped into that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a lot of friends in the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Josh Freeman, he's sold to grow well.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a gorilla to botanic care way back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Organic.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I mean, I grew up this area is a
lot, a lot of not not this area,
[SPEAKER_12]: but California.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the connections are deep,
you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're all tied to the Grateful
Dead, which is even more of a wild thing,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like there's this whole Grateful Dead tie
within the Bay area of people that love
[SPEAKER_12]: the dead, they have great stories about
the dead or more or less an evolution of
[SPEAKER_12]: the Grateful Dead in our own expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's, that's the most amazing thing
to be part of that as well from
[SPEAKER_12]: California.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like Logitech's brewery.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use that as an example all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tony McGee, I believe he is an evolution
of the Grateful Dead in his own expression
[SPEAKER_12]: and just as powerful and just as a
creative expression.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's like, I do my stuff and it's,
it evolves out of the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like the cannabis scene evolved out of the
Grateful Dead too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_12]: And other things too, but the Grateful
Dead was a heavy influence.
[SPEAKER_12]: And part of the reason we're here today,
that whole movement in the sixties and
[SPEAKER_12]: seventies.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's why, you know, this year we
brought.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're bringing O'Teal and friends to
GanaFest with Steve Kimach, Ed Melvin
[SPEAKER_12]: Seals, Jason Crosby, Steve Kimach,
Son, I forgot Johnny Kimach.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to be doing podcasts all
weekend there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be a blast.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is going to be a lot of fun,
dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be epic.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to bring the festival goers
together with the cannabis event goers
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's a tough thing to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been to a lot of events and seen a
lot of times people don't show up for the
[SPEAKER_12]: music or they don't show up for the weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, it's always hard to hit both.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of the way the walls kind of make
it separate.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've always tried our best to like
integrate what we're doing and normalize
[SPEAKER_12]: the herb.
[SPEAKER_12]: So at GanaFest we do it on the three and a
half acre part on the bay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Beautiful weekend of the year,
weekend after Labor Day.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's always just like the weather that
time of year is like, it'll be like 73
[SPEAKER_12]: degrees and sunny.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's just like the perfect
weather.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's that nice early fall, late summer
vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that far from that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're a month away, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we got like five weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have Reagan of the River,
five weeks is your event.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then another three weeks I'm doing the
Davodoo in San Francisco for Mila.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hosting it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got Nick and T coming out.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got Marlon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully he's performing there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be very exclusive.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all private.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's inclusive, but it's also exclusive
because there's only so many seats.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's all like these big events.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we can fit 70 in there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_12]: At least 10 guests.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, Ed Rosadull is definitely going
to be there and his wife.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: I came to GanaFest last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had an interview with me and the Royal
Gold crew.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ed is a character.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a character.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and they're good friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty sick man here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right at the back of the main entrance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Main Mall.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Blessings.
[SPEAKER_12]: Many blessings.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even when we're fucking around,
we're not fucking around.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Day two.
[SPEAKER_12]: Reggae in the River 2024.
[SPEAKER_12]: I survived day one somehow miraculously.
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually got sleep last night.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got an amazing lineup tonight.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really good music.
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw Nick and T this morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: Went swimming in the river.
[SPEAKER_12]: Smoked a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Did all the fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're here at the booth.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got John and Sean from Cutting Edge
down there and we're just chilling,
[SPEAKER_12]: selling books and smoking weed with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here with Sean from Cutting Edge.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're at Reggae in the River 2024.
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am so glad to have Reggae on the River
back.
[SPEAKER_13]: Last time I was here was like 2016 and
Cutting Edge has always been a part of
[SPEAKER_13]: Reggae.
[SPEAKER_13]: So to see it come back and to be back like
in a community level, not in a big
[SPEAKER_13]: corporate show out level and like,
hey, this is the vibes.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the vibe here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're definitely on the same vibration.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tell by your shirt.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's been an amazing journey so
far.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on day two.
[SPEAKER_12]: We got one more day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been here since Thursday.
[SPEAKER_12]: You as well?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's been hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been hot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good lineup.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great lineup.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think today the music is going to be
just off the charts.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be wild.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got Collie Buds tonight.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Marlin tomorrow night is going to be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I always love hearing Marlin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what are you guys doing here?
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys are one of the main sponsors.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've always been a part of the
material ever since like early,
[SPEAKER_13]: early 90s before Cutting Edge even
existed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, we wanted to throw some some
good times, good vibes here.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just giving out shirts, just hanging
out with the community.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys let us use your table.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're there slanging books, smoking with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, people show up and they see the
Roll Gold booth.
[SPEAKER_13]: They see the Cutting Edge booth and
they're all people that have fire.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're just trading smells, trading jars
and enjoying to see like everyone's work
[SPEAKER_13]: that they put in over the year.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got at least 50 different samples from
people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some stuff that I never seen before.
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw some Nigerian land race.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see that?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that was just so super scraggly.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the nose.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's wild.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's going to be on.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to film him tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want him to come down and talk about
podcasts and get hooked up.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, like and then I found the real
kind of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been searching for forever and I tell
people like, yeah, I'll look at it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this guy was like, if it's not the
real one, I won't have hurt feelings.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just tell me the truth.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he showed it to me and I was like,
I can't believe it's the real one.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted it almost not to be the real one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I had my mindset that it was going to be
another fake version or not even fake,
[SPEAKER_12]: but just not that I remember.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was totally blown away to smell
that smell after all these years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when sometimes I think your memory can
be mistaken after time passes,
[SPEAKER_12]: your memory might interpret things
differently.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then when you smell it, you're like,
oh no, my memory is right.
[SPEAKER_12]: They weren't the right ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: All these years smelling and you're like,
you want it to be that sour.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want it to be that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just like the super silver haze that
flower you showed me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yesterday I gave it to John and he was
like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the vision quest is over.
[SPEAKER_13]: But to find the original sour,
I'm still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have it over in a sample over in the
book.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have to go smoke that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the funny thing with the sour that I
remember is it wasn't just burnt tire,
[SPEAKER_12]: burnt rubber smell, which most of the
sours I've seen are more on that with a
[SPEAKER_12]: very little bit of citrus.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And this one has the balanced citrus.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's loud.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like when you open the bag and this was
depths and you open the bag, I was like,
[SPEAKER_12]: wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like the funk that hits you.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's the thing is like, it's always
burnt tires.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what people think sour is now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have that citrus back.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to have like this citrusy balance.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's also got this pungent funk to it
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's like nose burning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And not just from that, not just from the
burnt tire, you know, because that's what
[SPEAKER_12]: people think sour is.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say that most people, all the
people that have shown me last year,
[SPEAKER_12]: sorry guys, but it's been that burnt tire,
Chem 91 ish smell more than the sour that
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you have there?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, dude, this is something special.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a super silver haze joint that I
rolled.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you gave me one of those last
night.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Donnie burger, live rosin from Florian
Flame.
[SPEAKER_13]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_13]: I really am enjoying anything Donnie
burger like.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, so I have.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the best I've had.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not super impressed with the flour,
but as far as a washer, and then I have
[SPEAKER_12]: GMO rosin here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're smoking the GMO and then this and
comparing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can tell.
[SPEAKER_12]: You definitely tell the lineage in that.
[SPEAKER_12]: All we need is some Chem D and then we
could really do the trifecta.
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the dip device too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So do you know Matt from Dip Device?
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_13]: I got this at Squash Off in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really funny because I met.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was in a hotel in Mexico City for a
cannabis conference and it's actually
[SPEAKER_13]: where I bought this shirt.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I ran into Matt at the hotel bar
because he didn't know Spanish and he was
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to order a beer.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we started talking and he gave me one
of these and I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd never seen this before.
[SPEAKER_13]: And now I see him everywhere and there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll tell you what, I do like my nectar
collector.
[SPEAKER_12]: My boy Uncle Stoner, Big Ups Uncle Stoner,
but he gave me a nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Squash Off in Barcelona this year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love that thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love for the turps, but this is the
convenience right here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't get more convenient,
especially if you like extract and you
[SPEAKER_12]: don't want to smoke big dabs.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can smoke 50 of these in an hour and
you'll probably be high, but you'll feel
[SPEAKER_13]: really good.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's super, super, super clean.
[SPEAKER_12]: Floor and Flame.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're metric.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're down at Oakland.
[SPEAKER_12]: They need living soil and soil beds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Two tier game changer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like Chris Castle, the one of the
he's an owner and head grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: He is amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: He just crushes it and he believes in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also love living soil.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, yeah, I use cocoa.
[SPEAKER_12]: I do other substrates for my mom's.
[SPEAKER_12]: I use Grotian, but living soil for flavor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_13]: You really can't.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I know it even being on the
fertilizer side of things.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's certain things you're looking for
and different expressions you get from
[SPEAKER_13]: either really good biology or just
straight feeding programs.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a plant in Rockwell in a
commercial facility versus a living soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a whole different product.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to see a completely different
end product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the expression is different and the
effect, especially like I would argue that
[SPEAKER_12]: the effect is different and almost 100% of
my experiences with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have two things side by side,
you're going to get a different effect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, especially if you look at the
terpene profile, just the actual terpene
[SPEAKER_13]: profile.
[SPEAKER_12]: But also, you know, they look different.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think a lot of people love that
Instagram weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to put anybody down for
liking beautiful looking flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, some of the ugliest
shit I've smoked over the years is some of
[SPEAKER_12]: the best shit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you can't count out the ugly kid.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, you get like a really funky
IPA that's brewed in someone's basement.
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be the best beer you've ever had,
but you can't you can't make 1230 racks of
[SPEAKER_13]: that real quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's where PBR comes in.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't even replicate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those again, sometimes they're like,
you know, it's like and that's the
[SPEAKER_12]: boutique flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like it's grown once and
it's a certain way.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the same guy grows it and it's
slightly different variables.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So like whether the humidity was just
slightly different or the temperature was
[SPEAKER_12]: slightly different because the outside
temperature like threw it off or the
[SPEAKER_12]: outside humidity had impact.
[SPEAKER_12]: It can come out not completely different,
but it can come out a slightly different
[SPEAKER_12]: expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like micro brew.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I love that about boutique
flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think the market is
consistency with products like cutting
[SPEAKER_12]: edge.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: But on the grower side, just like on the
micro side, we can have those boutique
[SPEAKER_12]: products that have slight variation and
appreciate them equally.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys have a really good product,
too.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys believe in the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like John is a amazing contributor
to everything that we've done here.
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason I'm here, the reason you're
here is because of people like John.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're the generation that we really
need to acknowledge now while they're
[SPEAKER_12]: still here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it's great to be part of all
this and having him here and seeing like
[SPEAKER_12]: these younger kids to younger kids coming
on there in their 20s and they're excited
[SPEAKER_12]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're excited about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: All the other things.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like there's so many different
directions you can go and be successful.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's nothing better than getting
started early and finding what you love
[SPEAKER_13]: when you're young.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like people like John, that's how they
started.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like John started growing when he was 14,
hitchhiked his way out here and started
[SPEAKER_13]: growing in the hills and learned from
other people.
[SPEAKER_13]: This isn't something that you can just,
I mean, nowadays it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can pull up something on the Internet
and learn how to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_13]: But to really do it from the heart and
like what the culture really is,
[SPEAKER_13]: you got to learn from the other people
that have started before you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we go generational, like we can
learn from the previous generation who
[SPEAKER_12]: learned from the previous generation.
[SPEAKER_12]: If we think we can do it all ourselves,
we're kidding ourselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so improvement happens over time,
whether it's breeding or whether it's
[SPEAKER_12]: nutrients and understanding how to make
the plant work more efficiently,
[SPEAKER_12]: grow better, improve the quality.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we're doing the same thing,
but two different sides of the coin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're both trying to make the plant
express itself better or help the plant
[SPEAKER_12]: become optimal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to have that every once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll have a crappy free roll every
once in a while too.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not what we want to see for
this industry or for this culture.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why we're doing what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the work that you're doing from a
genetic standpoint, from a culture
[SPEAKER_13]: standpoint, it's like ungodly,
you know, like absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just filling my part of the gap of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you find what you're doing in the
industry that you were supposed to be
[SPEAKER_12]: doing with your life, it's a really good
feeling.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know that you can relate because
I feel like you're doing exactly what you
[SPEAKER_12]: were meant to do on this planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, your father and John's footsteps
and really have stepped up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's amazing to see that generational
where you can you can see it firsthand
[SPEAKER_12]: where the two generations are still there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, in our situation, like I don't have
to do anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing this because I want to.
[SPEAKER_13]: And John brought me to a hill when I was
14.
[SPEAKER_13]: That changed my life.
[SPEAKER_13]: That made me move west.
[SPEAKER_13]: That made me understand something
different about the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I get to the point where,
OK, John's in his late 60s.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is cutting edge going to be?
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, corporate companies offer us a
buyout.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I look at that and go, John,
we could be offered a billion dollars with
[SPEAKER_13]: a B.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not taking the money because it's
not about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And nobody else is going to stand up and
do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've watched it happen over and over
with all of our competition.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've got to kind of stand up and fight
for the community.
Exactly.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's happened over and over.
[SPEAKER_12]: We look at all these new change companies
that have sold out to bigger companies and
[SPEAKER_12]: then they change the formula or do
whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hard when you take the lifeblood out
of a company that built it from the ground
[SPEAKER_13]: up and you lose that for sales.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't sell your soul for sales.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you can.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't really sell the soul of the
company either.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like companies.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can sell a company.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sell intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sell recipes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sell genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can sell these things that that we can
that we can quantify.
[SPEAKER_12]: But like on the on the level of the soul
of the company that built that company
[SPEAKER_12]: that struggled to be successful,
you can never fully sell that because it's
[SPEAKER_12]: hard to even describe what it actually is
for one thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like because it's so many little
things that have happened over a period of
[SPEAKER_12]: such a long time, typically, like for you
guys and the evolution of where John came
[SPEAKER_12]: from to get where you guys are now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even you from the time you were 14 to
where you're at now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many things have happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many that have.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many things in the world that have
happened.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, I mean, on top of that,
so many things that have happened to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just this is an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's amazing to be part of all this.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're here at Reggae.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny coming home and it feels like
coming home.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see a lot of people I haven't seen
in a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm seeing people I've never met before
who watch the podcast, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a cool feeling.
[SPEAKER_12]: People that have grown my genetics,
they're giving me genetics back,
[SPEAKER_12]: hearing stories about my genetics being
grown 10 years ago and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny how people remember stuff and
how we're interpreted in the industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the community.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the cannabis community for
northern California.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the heart of the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's so many other aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is like where modern cannabis
came from is these hills.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and more so the mental side of
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So as far as people smoke weed all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But how it evolved in Humble and people
had to go hide out and grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't be doing that if it wasn't for
Humble because they're going outdoors and
[SPEAKER_12]: didn't want to get caught.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they started growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now indoor is super popular.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's nothing wrong with either one.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love indoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love outdoor.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love mixed lighting, greenhouse and you
name it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're here because of the people in
this community.
[SPEAKER_12]: They pushed this forward so that we could
be here today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Reggae on the River has always been like a
buying show.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always been July, end of July,
early August.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because first depths are done.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's here slinging packs.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it was always like.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it was before.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like now is I don't see the people
slinging packs.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like people maybe hustling a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I see is people that are
passionate about weed sharing samples and
[SPEAKER_12]: giving samples to each other.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I was talking about stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see a land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: That Nigerian was crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: That sour diesel that I saw was crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gotten joints from a ton of people.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw this crazy flower from last year.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoked some flower.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoked my Florida Rose.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was from last season.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: You did too.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And John gave me that three months ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: I preserved it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I was like saving it and couldn't
be a better place than Reggae to smoke
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know?
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's definitely some really good weed
going around.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of medium stuff too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you're going to find good stuff
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's people that love weed and people
that just know weed.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I saw some old school hash too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just smoked some.
[SPEAKER_12]: You saw Sunshine's hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_12]: She's going to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I smoked some with the dipper.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_13]: That stuff's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and that's like the nostalgic side
of cannabis where there's not a huge
[SPEAKER_12]: market for anything like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But when I see something like that,
I'm like, oh yeah, I like smoking that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hit it and I'm like, reminds me of
nineteen ninety fucking six.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when we got hash in the Bay Area
and like that, it's got that pliability.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not full melt or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, it's like takey Play-Doh.
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_12]: That has that kind of funky sandalwood
smell.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's like, hers had like this distinct
sandalwood smell that I remember from the
[SPEAKER_12]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_13]: Like when I rubbed my fingers together,
I'm like, yeah, just remember that smell.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a little bit of pine comes through and
you're like, oh, that's the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that hash though.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, of course.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I hope that we can link up soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: We need you down on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Uncle John from Cutting
Edge.
[SPEAKER_12]: He is a legend and I'm happy to be here
with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're sharing a booth.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing great things.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are doing great things.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's Reggae for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's great to be back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Reggae is back and that's the news.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sold out yesterday.
[SPEAKER_12]: Completely sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Completely sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: The venue is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love this place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been coming for a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: 24 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: 24 years was my first Reggae.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, I'm seeing old friends.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm seeing new people I've never met.
[SPEAKER_12]: I get to see people that I see all over
the world, like you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I get to see a lot of people, a lot of
different new varieties that they've been
[SPEAKER_10]: working on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoke them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get really high.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that I know that person.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I know that person?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually the son or daughter of
somebody.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I haven't seen the son or daughter for
like 15 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're in their 20s, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: The legend of all of this continues
through them.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was talking with Sean about it,
about being the second generation and
[SPEAKER_12]: people like yourself, we're on your guys'
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys really push the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't be here today with
legalization and everything without people
[SPEAKER_12]: like yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: They care enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: And even though it wasn't legal said,
it's not right.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the world needs people like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that now it's our
responsibility, like my responsibility
[SPEAKER_12]: with my podcast, with my genetics,
the things I do.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where I fit in the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's amazing seeing people like
yourself still in the industry working
[SPEAKER_12]: with Sean.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think he's doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys are pushing for this company
that's going places and that has good
[SPEAKER_12]: ethics and a consistent product.
[SPEAKER_10]: So family business, everything is made
in-house, chemistry, microbiology and
[SPEAKER_10]: plant pathology labs in-house.
[SPEAKER_10]: We trust our own work because if we don't
get it right, we take more samples and we
[SPEAKER_10]: get it right.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just like you do, you feed on and you
follow a certain pathway and then you're
[SPEAKER_10]: not happy and you back up and you go in
another direction.
[SPEAKER_12]: We do a lot of backing up.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's part of that process is going and
trying things and going, okay,
[SPEAKER_12]: this is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: These 10 things are not great.
[SPEAKER_12]: And how can we move forward with that to
where we're serving the plant the best,
[SPEAKER_12]: to where we're optimizing the plan for
specific environments.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're both here to do the same
thing is improve the plant or not even
[SPEAKER_12]: improve the plant, but make it as optimal
as possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: The outcome, whether it's through
nutrition, whether it's through genetics,
[SPEAKER_12]: they're both key elements to growing
amazing flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've always used our fertilizer to work
with people who want to express turpeins.
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a chef, you're in these flavors.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm all about the flavors.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've gone back to effect too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like you guys just have a really
consistent product.
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a good recipe along with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then customer service is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I always appreciate what you guys have
done as a company and how you stand in the
[SPEAKER_12]: industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are all very, everyone that works
for the company is proud to work for the
[SPEAKER_12]: company.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone believes in the product and that
says a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it when one of the workers is I
over here, I'm talking to somebody else
[SPEAKER_10]: and they say, I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't go to work every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And cause you know, we're always working
on something new.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're working with new people or helping
people turn around crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there are different soils.
[SPEAKER_10]: They, you know, there are people that get
your genetics and they want to repeat your
[SPEAKER_10]: results.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, it's 108 degrees out here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's going to be different,
but it's going to be worth it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So keep going.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Push forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Push forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was talking to one of your employees.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been working with the company for 20
years and he's here in Reggae hanging out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Having a good time with his daughter,
with his daughter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Miguel has worked, been our production
manager for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We moved, we moved to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: We moved to white city across from
Medford, but I took all the employees with
[SPEAKER_10]: me and their families.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't leave anybody behind.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you have quality and consistency if
you move in that higher only people,
[SPEAKER_10]: but his daughter, Raina is also here and
she's like, I think 24 now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But she started working for the company
when she was five.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave her a time card and she'd come
after school and I'd give her,
[SPEAKER_10]: she'd get little tasks to do with the
office, you know, clean the keyboards or
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's five years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: Child labor laws back there were
different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's big fines for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, she's like, she's like
family and now she's our main house
[SPEAKER_10]: coordinator of shipping, production and
office.
[SPEAKER_10]: So she oversees everyone and make sure,
make sure that everything is flowing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she knows how to do that just by
looking at people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine growing up in a company and
watching these people, watching your
[SPEAKER_10]: father and how he deals with people for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, now it's, it's instinctive and
intuitive.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's always ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why we don't need a big company.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just need a tight, well run company.
[SPEAKER_12]: But you have, you yourself have legacy in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: You, you got good legacy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've left behind a good legacy.
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're doing another one soon with Sean.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, you guys can check out the facility.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing some trials with different
nutrients right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd love to show you kind of what we're
doing and the direction we're going.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun continues.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, you know, I guess I went from
being infamous to somewhat famous,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I worked really hard to never have a
search warrant fulfilled on me or a felony
[SPEAKER_10]: filed on me.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't all say the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, but you know, we do our best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's one of those things that
like, I think people, it's, it's a tough
[SPEAKER_12]: time for a lot of people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: The guy's going to flower where it's like
a race to the bottom, you know,
[SPEAKER_12]: but you got to keep one foot in front of
the other and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, you did, you didn't just
blow up overnight.
[SPEAKER_12]: You've put a lot of hard work over many
years, you know, that started in the black
[SPEAKER_12]: market and then evolved into an amazing
business that you have today.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we started.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I started in 1978, so there wasn't
even traditional or black market even
[SPEAKER_10]: used.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were just an outlaw.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, the outlaw days brought me up
into where, you know, Proposition 215
[SPEAKER_10]: passed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I saw an opportunity to work more
closely with different PhD scientists.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them being Eleanor Kuntz and Kieran
Law.
[SPEAKER_10]: At Leafworks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're a PhD plant geneticist and
other small groups like that, that I was
[SPEAKER_10]: able to build on my knowledge base and
also get deeper into what plants need
[SPEAKER_10]: because, you know, we have a whole palette
of things we can custom blend for you that
[SPEAKER_10]: we know work a certain way that you can
see the result of a certain couple of
[SPEAKER_10]: terpenes or terpene pop up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So and more and more we're talking about
the chemical expression.
[SPEAKER_12]: So chemo or something that you can get a
consistent results where where it's going
[SPEAKER_12]: to give you the same chemical compounds at
the end.
[SPEAKER_12]: Consistently each run you do it,
which using the sun is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, in an indoor environment,
I think it's possible for synthesizing
[SPEAKER_12]: different drugs using cannabis or creating
stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole drug discovery we're just
scratching the surface of, but it takes a
[SPEAKER_12]: consistent product.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's amazing what you guys are doing
though.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I kind of backed off on
growing so I could move forward into
[SPEAKER_10]: traveling as much as I do to all these
different operations.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Columbia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do the Colombian Cup down there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys do that every year?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we do the Caribbean Cup.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've actually helped influence people
through working with Black to the Seed
[SPEAKER_10]: Company in Santa Marta, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Black to the Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Carlos Vimez, great guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Sergio, who works for them,
is great at going out and fighting seed.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: So Carlos, he was busting knowledge on me
about Colombian gold and why it's called
[SPEAKER_12]: chlorine gold.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he was telling me how Panama,
it's the same exact genetic line,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's expressed differently because
it's in Panama.
[SPEAKER_12]: Same thing with what most people know as
Oaxacan.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually the same Colombian land race
that's expressed differently in both
[SPEAKER_10]: Panama and in Oaxacan.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, Sergio now has the cleanest lines
of land race puteroja.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so now they're running trials,
like acres of trials.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: At their farm, at the Black to the Seed
Company farm, and Sativa Nativa,
[SPEAKER_10]: in order to actually see this trend come
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the changing fertilizer requirements on
some of these plants to try to adjust,
[SPEAKER_10]: to see those differences, to see Panama
Red come out of puteroja.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's other varieties there,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of this last Caribbean Cup on
July 26, they invited a lot of growers out
[SPEAKER_10]: of the mountains.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the Sierra Nevada, the Madre
Mountains are right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're 18,000 feet tall and snow-capped
right behind Santa Marta.
[SPEAKER_10]: So imagine all the different climatic
changes on the front of the mountain that
[SPEAKER_10]: faces the Caribbean and on the back side
that faces the Magdalena River at the
[SPEAKER_10]: plains.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're similar.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're in locations that are similar but
completely different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Climate changes are completely different
environments.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just like in Hawaii,
where you have, you know, a shade,
[SPEAKER_10]: a curtain of rain over one side,
the other side's dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's kind of like Sonoma and
Casadero.
[SPEAKER_12]: Casadero is like the northernmost part of
Sonoma, but it's completely different as
[SPEAKER_12]: far as like compared to Sebastopol as far
as climate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And like that banana belt up there is
extremely special.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you go up to Gualala and there's an
actual banana belt close to the coast that
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't pull in fog.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I mean, I knew people that were
growing there in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_10]: And their herb was coming out amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were getting seed from Oaxaca to
grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the Oaxaca is totally different.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we're down to Oaxaca too in
Guadalajara, Costa Rica and Colombia.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, we're working with any growers
that are passionate about growing the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's no time for people that
just want to, yes, we're just going to
[SPEAKER_10]: spend 50 million dollars, create this
facility, blow up a couple of different
[SPEAKER_10]: strains and we're going to push,
you know, unicorn poop out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That happens all the time, though.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_12]: The funny thing is, is like we joke about
like, but it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_12]: These guys are like, we're going to make
money off this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not only true in Catavis.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true in everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was up at White Salmon
Vineyard in the fall because I also go up
[SPEAKER_10]: to Yakima.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some growers up there that I like
to drop in and see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's Peter Brem's winery and he's,
you know, he's got a vineyard.
[SPEAKER_10]: He just turned 90.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went out, walked the field with him,
went up the hill, smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's like, yeah, I think, you know,
I think this is the year I'm going to
[SPEAKER_10]: retire.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like Peter.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, when you were 76 years old and
you said that and I said it was too soon,
[SPEAKER_10]: that was too late.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go, you're such a legacy, but you
actually have to die in this vineyard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go, did you realize that I can never
retire either?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to die in the field.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is who we are.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what happens at a certain point,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: At a certain point, you're like,
look at Jerry.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the example, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got to follow.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah, I mean, once you've created
this legacy, walking away from it,
[SPEAKER_12]: you'll never be able to walk away from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is who you are, you know.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're like, I'm not, this is what I love.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see people like yourself that have
become successful that are just passionate
[SPEAKER_12]: about the plant.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely inspiring.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, people are people.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was talking to the Caribbean
about you, as a matter of fact,
[SPEAKER_10]: your seed company.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're like, oh, man, we're,
you know, we know we're going to win with
[SPEAKER_10]: our flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we looked at the seed
varieties and James Loud seeds weren't
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, yeah, you know,
we couldn't get everywhere quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Enough in order to be able to bring them
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: But next year, we next year, we'll make a
point of doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was like, yeah, you know,
I look at what James Loud's doing and,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it's super impressive.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's a lot younger guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_10]: People think, wow, if you can do it
through all the hard work and sacrifice
[SPEAKER_10]: and be where you are now and be happy,
they want to be there, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: One day at the end of the day,
we all serve a purpose on this planet.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pride is a weird thing, but to be proud of
being part of all this, that's that's
[SPEAKER_12]: where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just happy and excited that I get to
be a part of this every day.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love what I get to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like I found my place.
[SPEAKER_12]: I found my people.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and it's just an amazing
community of people that really care about
[SPEAKER_12]: something bigger than themselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's so many faces I get to see
events like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like the cups that I've been to
over the years and like really passionate
[SPEAKER_12]: people.
[SPEAKER_12]: That are part of the community and they've
done something to move the planet forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they've done it, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, even if forward is in a direction
you don't think is really good because you
[SPEAKER_10]: don't agree with the genetics they're
working with.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to appreciate the work they put in
in order to get there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Legacies are built over a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I think one of the biggest
things is, you know, you're on the right
[SPEAKER_12]: path with stuff falls into place,
right?
[SPEAKER_12]: When stuff's crazy and it falls apart,
sometimes you just have to have the guts
[SPEAKER_12]: to keep going.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, you're really in the right
place when it starts falling into place,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like serendipity, like you get
serendipitous events where you meet
[SPEAKER_12]: someone twice, three times, four times,
and good people, you're doing business.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unintentionally, you start working with
them and they do good business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've come across so many good people just
in the United States that are held on to
[SPEAKER_10]: things, you know, like the guy that won
the cup for Sour Diesel in Rhode Island
[SPEAKER_10]: uses our products.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he got his Sour Diesel seed from his
friend whose dad grew Sour Diesel out here
[SPEAKER_10]: in Redway in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he was able to start a bunch of that
seed and just get a few seeds to pop.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a couple of them were female and he
just ran with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now two years later, these,
you know, it looks like the right
[SPEAKER_10]: structure that has the right smell.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has the right smoke.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're going to check out what I got
today.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I smelled it and I'm like,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just the burnt tires.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got the like the citrus back to it
where it's real loud and bright.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's not just burnt tires,
which is like more of the Kim 91 side
[SPEAKER_12]: where it's all kind of got that Kimmy
smell.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love sour and to see that here.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the perfect place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, it's going to be a regular,
you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is what Reggae on the River is
all about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our community.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about people coming around and coming
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are people out of these still
still that are just growing the real
[SPEAKER_10]: pineapple like the real original
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have this little market niche
that they sell to and they don't grow a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, you can completely miss it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes I feel like I'm going down the
freeway at 90 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm missing my exit, you know,
to get to these people.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you guys doing the old school stuff,
especially, you know, I mean, there's a
[SPEAKER_12]: ditch market for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't say that it's wanted by
everybody.
[SPEAKER_12]: But like, I think a lot of people,
if they were shown it in the right
[SPEAKER_12]: condition to smoke it, they'd be like,
oh, yeah, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: You show them it's not purple and you're
in the city.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_12]: This super silver.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I don't know about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, how can you not like that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have to see the super silver from
Florin Flav?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my friend Chris Castle.
[SPEAKER_12]: They grew that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, he's he's the steward of
that guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's from tissue culture, from apical
biotech.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that is one of my favorite cuts.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the effect of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the sound.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells just like the original super
silver that I first saw in 1979.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, without seeing the plant,
that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's got a more compact blower.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, he's using modern
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, stuff that didn't exist in 1979.
Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you didn't have a ton of options in
1975.
[SPEAKER_12]: You had bone meal.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bone meal, compost and bone meal.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there was options.
[SPEAKER_12]: People made growing plants for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just it's gotten.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the thing is, I can say that in the
90s, the biggest problem with vegetarian
[SPEAKER_12]: companies is they had recipes and they
were never good by themselves.
[SPEAKER_12]: And now that's different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there's a lot of testing done,
like some days like yourself, where you
[SPEAKER_12]: actually test the recipes.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can follow your recipe to the tea and
get amazing results.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and handful of other companies,
I feel like they do the same where they
[SPEAKER_12]: put forth the effort.
[SPEAKER_12]: They give you the real recipe.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no hidden secrets.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good recipe and not even a base
recipe.
[SPEAKER_12]: You just follow that recipe and you get
results.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, we have an
HPLC, the GCMS, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: us having to test everything in order to
know what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: People can just send the customer or the
breeder to just send it into a lab and
[SPEAKER_10]: they can get the results.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot less work for us and I'm happy
for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And plus, it's like a third party testing,
too.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's even better.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's like we weren't doing all the
testing even with genetics.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't doing the testing like we're
doing now.
[SPEAKER_12]: We test everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have COAs for all our flowers,
all our phenotypes that we keep.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have COAs.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the model for us is to be able to show
the finished product, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now I'm doing a trial with LED
versus HPS with the same cultivars so that
[SPEAKER_12]: customers can see.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you go out on HPS, it's like this.
[SPEAKER_12]: When you grow it under LED, it's like
this.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are both good results.
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you have?
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what's optimal for your
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So like you want a specific amount of
grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_12]: These are the options that you have if
you're trying to go for that.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're going for this specific gear
profile, if you have a HPS, it might do
[SPEAKER_12]: like BlueDream does way better HPS.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: That needs that big, deep red.
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs that heat, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just sweated the heat.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it just swells up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's amazing how the plant morphs or
changes with not just with time,
[SPEAKER_10]: but with what we're talking about,
the evolution of the fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_10]: the biologicals used, the soils,
and the lighting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the lighting is the big one.
[SPEAKER_12]: And stuff they used to really figure out
now with LEDs and concentrated PPFD,
[SPEAKER_12]: when you get it right in there,
it doesn't get the foxtails like it used
[SPEAKER_12]: to somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're in our shape, but they don't get
the foxtails.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think a lot of that has to do with
heat, too, because we used to grow with
[SPEAKER_12]: HPS for everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I love HPS.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what it does for the
environment, but LEDs are definitely more
[SPEAKER_12]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Mixed Light the best.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's the future of the industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, we're all going to go towards
Mixed Light because we can use the sun.
[SPEAKER_12]: The sun creates amazing flavor molecules,
whether we're talking about cliles,
[SPEAKER_12]: turpenes, flavorants, whatever you want to
call them.
[SPEAKER_12]: The aroma is impacted by the sun and in a
good way.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the sun's spectrum is amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It changes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even a constant, like the solar
flare that happened this summer,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That almost knocked out all our cell
service.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't think that affected plants?
[SPEAKER_10]: People don't even know really what that
did for a lot of their plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They see changes in what elements it picks
up.
[SPEAKER_12]: And cannabis, as opposed to other plants
in agriculture, cannabis is a very
[SPEAKER_12]: resilient plant that can adapt to almost
any environment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas some of this over time with
climate change and these climates are
[SPEAKER_12]: changing so much, we'll see what happens
to the natural agriculture that does
[SPEAKER_12]: really well.
[SPEAKER_12]: That may change from region to region.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like we're experiencing hotter days
on Earth than we've ever had in our
[SPEAKER_12]: lifetime, but probably in the last 100,000
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I see just in the Rogue Valley
before I left, so many people switching to
[SPEAKER_10]: red shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and the difference between 25%
and 50%.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I looked at 50% and veg time was
shorter.
[SPEAKER_10]: The structure was better.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know how it's going to end up.
[SPEAKER_10]: But for instance, West Coast Farms up in
Tallinn, they used the 50% shade cloth
[SPEAKER_10]: from the very start.
[SPEAKER_10]: And 50% takes a lot of sun out.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You hold an infrared gun on the soil
outside, it's 145.
[SPEAKER_10]: You step inside, and it might be 108 or
110.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you put it under the plant,
and it might be in the low 90s.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the canopy might be in the high
80s.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so now all of a sudden, that's a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big, big shift right there.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a huge game changer for cultivation
and not stressing the plants out.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you get a plant going above 105,
and it's not going to be happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Even above 90, it's not... Up here,
it gets above 90 every day, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But talking about 105, that's no good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the plant respirates, so it can drop
its temperature as long as it has
[SPEAKER_10]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But years ago, I went to one garden,
and the person was freaking out because
[SPEAKER_10]: their plants were getting spots on them
and all these different efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, you're using our fertilizer,
you're getting deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy was really, really worried.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went up and I checked out his place.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in Willets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, great.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you think you planted at the edge line
of an oak forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what's happening is the sun has
shifted from being high to now it's being
[SPEAKER_10]: low and it's hitting all the bags.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he goes, no, it's not happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go, OK, I'll come back tomorrow
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll bring a thermometer, a soil
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And his soil was like at 118 degrees.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go, this is great because you've killed
all the bacteria and fungi in the soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're completely reliant on injecting
fertilizer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the type of clay you're growing
doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, he's growing like AK-47,
which we know is totally adaptable.
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you strip out the soil and high
heat like that, it's done.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're taking away the most valuable part
of using the substrate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: But those black grow bags, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, put your hand in.
[SPEAKER_10]: He went, oh.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine if you're a root, you have
nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the invite.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been so much fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been really, really, really hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys got some really good flavors over
there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the fact that they have a rec area
where you can consume.
[SPEAKER_12]: Consumption areas are always like,
we need to move those forward a little bit
[SPEAKER_12]: faster, you know, across the state,
especially.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like consumption.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a natural for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially for normalizing the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just really important in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 215 era, I come from the 215 era.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back then, I made tasters and I
brought my flowers to different
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries locally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for this plant, I brought it to you
with ankle wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: True story.
[SPEAKER_05]: But back then, when the dispensaries came
out and they had these lounges,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, for example, Hemp Center,
Hemp Center had this stage where people
[SPEAKER_05]: could play music, couches all around the
bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like the first place that had the
bar where they had the alcohol,
[SPEAKER_05]: the volcano, the bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just did it for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still love the volcano.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's still actually shade of tall
trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve and I, we found the volcano part.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like somebody's old volcano.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, let's just check this stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what we found.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a lot of stuff is still nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like hot dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, I will smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to do the hash bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: Infamous Glass makes a nice hash bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the wand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the wand because you can hit it
hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean hot for wand, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And get like that, you know, hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then at the end, you can actually
taste more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love watching the waterfall cascading
down the river.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like germs, I like flavor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like effect too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get it wrong, I like effect too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, Punch has White Thor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, who has White Thor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Punch has White Thor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a good one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, as far as effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a great event though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed with the crowd, everyone's
been on a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Loving the event.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stoked they can come over here and
roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have this rolling table.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just roll some rolling joys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, come back later and get more.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on 50 joys in two days so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should get Steve over here to smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we will.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to try?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to try any of the extras?
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got some Donnie Burger from Florid
Flame.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's liborosate organic living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got the little dabber here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Afghan gushers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's the container.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, it's Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_12]: I really like Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of antics on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong, I believe it's an S1
of GMO.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm smelling onions.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have GMO right behind her in that tent.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have GMO rosin.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely related.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can really tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get that onion thing going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_12]: All you do is push this down and touch the
hot end.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the nectar collector electorates.

[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_12]: Day 3, Reggae in the River.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Dave from Budjolero.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing today, Dave?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing good, thanks.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for coming on and talking to me for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: We met yesterday over sour diesel,
something I've been looking for for a
[SPEAKER_12]: long, long, long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gotten samples of sour diesel from so
many different people and you came up to
[SPEAKER_12]: me and said, check this out.
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not the right one, you can be
honest with me, which I totally appreciate
[SPEAKER_12]: because I get that a lot and you got the
right cut.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I haven't seen it in years and it has,
I mean, when you squeeze it, you just get
[SPEAKER_12]: the real sour smell.
[SPEAKER_12]: You get the aroma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I'm just stoked to kind of
still have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had it for 21 years and when I got
it, I knew it was special so I kept it
[SPEAKER_04]: just because it was special to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the cat piss, it gives me hope that
there is real cat piss still.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's someone out there that has it.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many different cat pisses.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they're real to those people that
have them, all these different ones,
[SPEAKER_12]: but the one that's real to me that I miss
the most has been gone.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's eluded me for a long time and my
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the Romulan for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had this one Romulan and it was the one
for me and nobody else had it and I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been looking for it ever since.
[SPEAKER_12]: Romulan was amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 years ago, Romulan was the one.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Romulan, we had the Shamulan,
but it was like, we just call it the
[SPEAKER_12]: Shaman, but it was like a Romulan.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a Shaman back cross with the Romulan
and it was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: The color was one of those purple ones
that didn't have the effect that matches
[SPEAKER_12]: the color.
[SPEAKER_12]: You think of Romulan, it was more of an
uplifting and powerful smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, mine was the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to call it the head denter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was like straight the most
sedative cannabis I've ever smoked in my
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so it's different to see the
different expressions and like we were
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about earlier, the way it's grown
can express itself and have all so
[SPEAKER_04]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of times with the sour,
it can be really good or it can be not so
[SPEAKER_04]: good, real easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's kind of like a fine line
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you mess up the cure, there's none of
that good sour smell and it just goes to
[SPEAKER_04]: hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes to hay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it totally goes to hay, which is
mostly what I see, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of the stuff I've seen is hay.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's hard to tell if it was even the
real cut when it's hay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there should be some of it in there,
but I've grown it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really got to squeeze for sometimes,
but I've grown under HPS and LED and I
[SPEAKER_04]: will say the LED is nowhere near like the
HPS.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I grew it for a long time under HPS
and the first LED harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what what happened to the
sour?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is not what I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's heat and there's far red.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there's some big differences with
those.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_12]: But Blue Dream is another example of
something that should be grown under HPS
[SPEAKER_12]: that does better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it performs better under HPS.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just like outdoor strains
that don't do well outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they do better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's part of kind of learning how to
grow different varieties, what they like,
[SPEAKER_04]: what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, all these different sours I've
seen, there's there's that sour in there
[SPEAKER_12]: or it has the structure or it has a little
bit of the smell.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it even has the smell and the
look.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I go to smoke it and you're like,
it's just not the one.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the one that I remember.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yours is the first thing I've seen in
20 years, maybe a little bit less than 20
[SPEAKER_12]: years, probably like 12 years,
14 years, something like that,
[SPEAKER_12]: because it really went away in like 2012,
2014.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gorilla Glue kind of was the pivoting
point, I think, for basically everybody
[SPEAKER_12]: switched to Gorilla Glue that I knew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hot for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like everything people start
to grow it and then you get enough bland
[SPEAKER_04]: batches or mediocre batches and people
start to gravitate towards something else
[SPEAKER_04]: that's better real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you call and they're like,
oh, I got the sour and like it wasn't good
[SPEAKER_04]: last time I'm on to something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whatever the case was.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think a lot of people lost it
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard someone talk about how they got
busted and they lost their cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotplate and Veroid.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think the genetics deteriorated
with Hotplate and Veroid.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when people were growing them,
they weren't getting good yields.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was dudding.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think they contributed to one
of the early vectors of Hotplate and they
[SPEAKER_12]: got spread around, which I remember it
wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of my friends grew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't the same too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've often thought maybe mine has
some sort of virus after growing it under
[SPEAKER_04]: an LED and then just seeing some weird
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I had one of my best yields ever
under LEDs and I almost gave up on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my buddy grew it last year in his
outdoor patch.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, OK, it's still got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it probably needs to be disucultured.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we want or what we're hoping to
get out of it is still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I'm going to roll the dice
and I'm going to put 20 in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really glad I did because it came
out kind of what I've been kind of I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been looking for it, even though I've had
it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done as much growing recently,
so I had some friends grow it outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out really great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then when I grew it inside, I was like,
oh, this is disappointing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think a lot goes to how you're
growing it, where you're growing it,
[SPEAKER_04]: what nutrients you're using, when you're
using them.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think are the best for
nutrients for sour specifically?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it likes nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It likes to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first recipe was the GH recipe back in
the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's like the Lucas recipe,
just that basic GH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it likes organics, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was growing it side by side
with a friend's soil versus hydro rock
[SPEAKER_04]: wool, you know, the clay pellets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to just express itself to its
fuller potential when grown in soil with
[SPEAKER_04]: organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my friend, same friend was growing
in soil, but with chemi nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think one thing that I started
doing, I was like, OK, what nutrient is
[SPEAKER_04]: most responsible for smell and flavor?
[SPEAKER_04]: So is sulfur.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I think there's been some
studies that came out recently that sulfur
[SPEAKER_04]: is responsible for that, like,
skunky aroma.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, abstract tech, they're kind of
flavorants, but it has to do with thiols
[SPEAKER_12]: and sulfur and sulfur being it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think that's necessarily what
gives the sour, it's skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did start kind of gravitating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why it's pungent,
though, is from that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some epsom salt, you know, from the store
just because it's cheap and easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used a lot of different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used botanic air, advanced nutrients,
bio biz, organics alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it just likes good amended
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: This last round, I used a blend of
organics alive and some bio link with some
[SPEAKER_04]: inoculants, you know, just kind of
standard run of the mill organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd really do like some of the more
water soluble organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I do inject and totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've got kind of it's not automated,
but I've got the five rows at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all separated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all an emitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just turn on a couple of lines at a
time and then just, you know, watch the
[SPEAKER_04]: tank go down, switch the lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of stuff still does clog it,
even the really, you know, soluble
[SPEAKER_04]: organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the stuff just just clogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But good organic stuff clogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, nothing special.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's got a greenhouse with some
good ventilation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're not just a one hit wonder.
[SPEAKER_12]: You showed me some other land race
genetics that were, you know, stuff that
[SPEAKER_12]: you just don't see.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might see the rig in the river,
but you really typically wouldn't see it
[SPEAKER_12]: anywhere else in California other than in
the hills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I haven't seen a lot of it myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm you know, I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've been kind of a traditional
kind of hype guy almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I grew a lot of sour
predominantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I've never really kind of I've
always gravitated towards stuff that was
[SPEAKER_04]: different, you know, and just held on to
that kind of ran with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my father-in-law has been
collecting seeds and pollen from around
[SPEAKER_04]: the world since the 60s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as I met him, I knew that he
had something different going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took me a little while to kind of
experience what he was trying to share
[SPEAKER_04]: with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of like to call it like an
indica detox.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to almost only smoke these types
of varieties to really understand the high
[SPEAKER_04]: because they don't slap you in the face
super hard instantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a good OG Kush, for example,
you know, it just.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard and quick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where some of these other varieties,
it kind of builds up to this thing where
[SPEAKER_04]: you get to a point where you're like,
damn, I am so high right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that can be subtle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it takes full course is actually
really strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you start to notice that
experience kind of from start to finish
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of it does come on quick,
you know, like the African Hayes 11 is a
[SPEAKER_04]: really quick acting strong high and it
lasts for a long time and it can be pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those pearls that I showed you are
similar, but I feel like it's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: less racy and more of that like good
giggly feeling where you just feel
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: They take a long time to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of things can go wrong in
14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the pearls, they look like
something you might throw away.
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Grinspin is like, yeah, I mean,
yeah, it looks like most people would call
[SPEAKER_12]: that undesirable or they'd be like,
that's what I used to see.
[SPEAKER_12]: And high times in the seventies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people associate that with have some,
for some reason, have a negative
[SPEAKER_04]: connotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think a lot of it just comes down
to, well, be honest with yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you grow it to its full potential?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you didn't, then you can't
really say it was or wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned that the hard way with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I recently got rid of some good genetics
that I thought weren't good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I later found out they were and I should
have kept them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just, you know, sometimes the
yield is not great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the yield is actually really
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it just takes someone that is
really after the experience and the high,
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole kind of enchilada of growing it,
rolling the joint, growing it multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: times to figure out what to do with it,
to like how you can improve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, you could grow it once
and it didn't come out that good and you
[SPEAKER_04]: grow it over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how I learned how to grow
really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew the sour repeatedly as many times
as I could for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really taught me this is a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a Cal Mag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was able to, identify certain things
so that when I grew other plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like, okay, I know what to look for
as opposed to, well, it could be under
[SPEAKER_04]: watering with this plant or over watering
or a nutrient issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't know until you do it
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you know what a good version of
sour is or a good version of Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've done it enough times to
know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I love Bubba.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bubba's name got ruined in the,
you know, starting 10 years ago when they
[SPEAKER_12]: started mass producing Bubba in huge
warehouses.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think a lot of people think of
Bubba as something completely different
[SPEAKER_12]: than what I know is Bubba and what you
know is Bubba.
[SPEAKER_12]: That pre-98 soapy has a, you know,
it has an amazing aroma.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gassy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's soapy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_12]: It smokes good.
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a good effect.
[SPEAKER_12]: In my opinion, it checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's like the whole, in Oakland,
San Leandro, they were, between Oakland
[SPEAKER_12]: and San Leandro, on San Leandro Avenue,
they were going, just filling warehouses,
[SPEAKER_12]: just growing Bubba, pulling it 53 days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or less.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes 49 days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, it's like, depending on who
you grow and what cut you have,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, just because it's called one
thing doesn't mean that it's necessarily
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, Bubba Kush is a great example
because there's several cuts of Bubba
[SPEAKER_12]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's, there's one good one,
in my opinion, that I've seen over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get that a lot with the sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: People ask me, what cut is this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, well, I don't know because it
was just the sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pre any names, you know,
and people's reaction, like, yours was
[SPEAKER_04]: often like, well, I haven't seen this one,
you know, since back in the day or for 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like, well, what, what do you
have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I had some friends, they got a batch
from my buddy that had seeded itself and
[SPEAKER_04]: they grew those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said for years that that sour
that came out of those seeds wasn't the
[SPEAKER_04]: same as the sour clone that we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was a little bit watered
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it got a little bit of pollen from
something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was self, who knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, that sour cut, you know,
it was just a sour and I'm thankful that
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kept on to it, you know, cause I feel
like it is a special one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of knew just my gut was telling
me, just don't let go of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't let go of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I really connected with it in a
really strong way and was around other
[SPEAKER_04]: people that had that same really strong
connection when it was really popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting to see, you know,
I kind of just throw my arms up and be
[SPEAKER_04]: like, man, it's just sour, you know,
it's just a good batch of sour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the next one comes out that
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, totally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I mean, it is farming from harvest to
harvest is different because that's
[SPEAKER_12]: slightly different.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's like you try to get it as
consistent as possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you do it right, it's going to be
good.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do it wrong, it's not going to be
as good, but typically it's going to be
[SPEAKER_12]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mean, growing in a
greenhouse versus indoor and outdoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's all going to be different.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to have a totally different
and structurally to the bud can be
[SPEAKER_12]: structurally different indoor versus
outdoor versus greenhouse versus mixed
[SPEAKER_04]: light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've found that the area sour stinks
more than the really dense sour.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For whatever reason, there's just more
like, like air surface area for that smell
[SPEAKER_04]: to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I find like on the indoor,
the bigger buds would be less stinky than
[SPEAKER_04]: the smaller buds that were maybe weren't
as dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is now you're getting into the same
plant grown the same way, but different
[SPEAKER_04]: parts of the plant are producing different
types of buds, you know, as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_12]: top lot more turp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're going to have to get you down
to the Bay Area, get you on a show.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd love to do a whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Come down.
[SPEAKER_12]: We could smoke the sour together,
talk about it, smoke some of the other
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff that it was a bubba haze that you
had.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: The bubba kush original haze.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Real bubba aroma, like nostalgic bubba
smell, but it has something else to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little funky, a little sharp on the
nose, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a good combo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my favorite hybrids right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a great yielder, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you so much for your time
today, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll do this again soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here with Nickatee.
[SPEAKER_12]: He is at Reggae on the River 2024 with me.
[SPEAKER_12]: You did two sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling blessed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling so blessed just to be here at
Reggae on the River to have this festival
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been going to this festival for over
two decades.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time I met my wife was the first
vacation we had when I was here.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's up, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, good times.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a beautiful weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've had Reggae for several years,
so to bring it back with this kind of
[SPEAKER_12]: energy, you did some amazing sets both
Friday and Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed the Friday, but the Saturday set
was great.
[SPEAKER_12]: You got good energy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't have a better place to be a DJ
at or a musician or just as a spectator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to just be part of this bigger
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a hot weekend,
but it's such a blessing to get to see all
[SPEAKER_02]: my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing people I haven't seen in
over a decade because we haven't been here
[SPEAKER_02]: on the riverbank.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I kind of knew you were going to be
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw your name somewhere on something and
then just driving in and you're like
[SPEAKER_12]: walking in.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, OK, Nickatee's here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a good weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, everybody's here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got Marlon here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Axe, they've had so many good
performers over the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight's going to be another amazing
night.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, last night we finished with
Capelton and then they did the battle with
[SPEAKER_12]: the Dub place last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring that real, real Jamaican culture
here is really the first of its kind to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring that to Reggae on the River.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love what Leo has done with this
festival and the acts that he's brought,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you were mentioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like all the big headlining acts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of this underground reggae
music and sound system culture that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: booked.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 41 DJs slash sound systems that he
brought to this event.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love that aspect of this event.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I heard that that sound system was a
million dollars down at the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the price is,
but Christopheri Royal Sound and Lighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: they know how to tune a sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not only setting up the sound,
it's not only their relationship with Void
[SPEAKER_02]: Acoustics, but it's tuning that sound that
Chris and Zach and the whole Royal Sound
[SPEAKER_02]: and Lighting family just have on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can turn that up so much louder down
there and not hurt your ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main stage was a little less because
the main stage, but the dance hall is a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful thing to be able to play on
that, let alone listen to it in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what were your favorite acts this
weekend so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: So many good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conscience really threw down last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lila Ike made me cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was emotional for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, there's been so many already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already losing track.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm close enough that I can hear all
the acts even though I don't go to all
[SPEAKER_02]: the...
[SPEAKER_02]: Capelton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capelton was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capelton was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen Capelton 15 times, 20 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just brings the energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony B was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony B got a little cheesy for me,
but I love him.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's recovering from a surgery I heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give him a little credit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Capelton just crushes every time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like so much energy.
[SPEAKER_12]: The crowd goes wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big flags in the crowd moving around
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know who else I loved is DeMarco's
set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought DeMarco's set was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little kid that raps him too
short yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lake Anthony, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lake crushes it every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got to see one of his first
performances in Tahoe at the Tahoe Reggae
[SPEAKER_02]: Fest a few years back and I was like,
all right, this kid's gonna do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now his voice has even changed,
but it's getting better and he's even more
[SPEAKER_02]: just in tune and in key with the songs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's singing every lyric.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a beautiful thing, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just the energy here is just... You were
talking about you just went and got a
[SPEAKER_12]: massage.
[SPEAKER_12]: They got it hooked up everywhere here and
the food's great.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're doing our own food too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I love cooking, but the food's good here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's amazing and it's sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's completely sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like everyone's in a great
mood.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes when it's super packed,
people get all bummed out or pissed off or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but there's none of that here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a beautiful vibe and energy
throughout the entire weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had any bad vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm camping with the good vibe tribe over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You absolutely are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally the good vibe tribe.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen a couple of people wandering at
four in the morning looking for their
[SPEAKER_12]: tents, but that's bound to happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, October 1st, I'm doing the Dabadoo
in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm trying to get you out there.
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully we can do this 10-year
anniversary thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because 10 years ago, we did it with
Dougie and Mila in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was a good time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully we can repeat that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to get a heavyweight belt.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the person who wins is getting a
Dabadoo heavyweight belt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything for Mila, I'd love to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She put me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people thank me throughout
these festivals for putting them on or
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching them about solventless.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mila put me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I owe all the love and credit to Mila.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's just a kind soul and just
cares about the industry and cares about
[SPEAKER_02]: people very few.
[SPEAKER_02]: For real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's still hitting so many events
every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Androids.
[SPEAKER_02]: She rose her splits.
[SPEAKER_02]: She smokes harder than most of us young
guys.
100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not young anymore, but even still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think her and my homie Ja Weiser
from Ja Warrior Shelter, another one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: mentors who's DJing, this weekend,
they'd be battling it out in my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the judges that I see throughout,
they can't smoke like Mila and Ja Weiser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two, they're my judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you so much for your time,
man.
[SPEAKER_12]: I look forward to getting you on another
podcast.
[SPEAKER_12]: Your last podcast was a hit.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always a blessing and a pleasure,
man.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, James.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's day three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Marlon again.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, Marlon?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fine, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good to be here on the river.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an amazing show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capelton last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capelton was on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always expect, you know,
he brings it every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always expect an amazing performance
from Capelton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blessing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the sound system down at the river is
actually pretty amazing, too.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a million dollar sound
system they have down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they went all out to make sure
that this reggae on the river was a
[SPEAKER_01]: success and I think it paid off,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going on tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I play like 6.30 tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna be a lot of good vibes going on on
the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a pleasure to represent Roots
Rock Reggae music, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are anticipating that
segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, man, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many good acts.
[SPEAKER_12]: So much fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: So many people.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they sold out for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can tell they sold out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's packed.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really packed with happy people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about the lineup,
everyone was, you know, they put the right
[SPEAKER_01]: artists together on the right days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all made sense, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The balance, the energy, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was a good vibe.
[SPEAKER_12]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're probably gonna talk again

River at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like reggae.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said I'll call you back or

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a good adventure.
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like the experience was great.
[SPEAKER_12]: The river was warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a little algae in the river.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I can't wait to come back
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait next year, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be awesome.

[SPEAKER_03]: I have the music in the background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is partying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the highlight of your weekend as
far as flowers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably that sour diesel you gave me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was special.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to take a little some long ribs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_12]: That and the Nigerian haze was amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: I spoke some Nigerian haze that was like
creeper weed and just creeped up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Gently lifting you up to the right place.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it was just an amazing weekend.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, great.
