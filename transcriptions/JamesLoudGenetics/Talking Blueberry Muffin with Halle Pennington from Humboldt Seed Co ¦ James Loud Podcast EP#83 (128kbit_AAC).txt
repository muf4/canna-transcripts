[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, our special guest is Hallie
from Humboldt Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an amazing spot you guys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've been trying to get you and
your father on the show for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you're finally here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I am super stoked that I made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know my dad will hopefully make it
in soon as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a hard guy to lock down sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like he's really busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's definitely very busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's kind of the work seven days a week
mentality type of person.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's either at the farm busting his ass
or at our office dealing with accounting
[SPEAKER_05]: and phone calls and the whole nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you guys have really become an
international company over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, especially following your Instagram
post from what I see, you guys are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you guys at Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spain is always a big one for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have kind of our affiliate branch over
there and we have a super awesome crew
[SPEAKER_05]: that helps us deal with all of the
packaging and does all the setup for
[SPEAKER_05]: Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really essential for our
operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of amazing just even going
and seeing it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: There because I grew up where everything
was super hush hush.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad always had a fake job that I'd tell
my teachers about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it wasn't fake, but it was a cover
job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so switching to going to somewhere
like Spain, which is always a dream place
[SPEAKER_05]: to visit, I think, for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Barcelona is just an incredible city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having hundreds of people recognize
our strains and tell us they love them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spannibus is always a really, really
special experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Germany was amazing this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to Germany, but I heard that
was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Spannibus is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite event of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where I get to see my friends from
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJ Biz is its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing like Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much passion there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it reminds me of the good old days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Original Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't even start going Emerald Cup
until 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's people who are just truly
gathering from passion around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a part of that is the fact
that they don't have a super recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of that gray market,
especially for genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have a lot of these super
unique characters that just really love to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have the total alternative,
which is MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all the suits in the industry,
which is really my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MJ Biz has really grown on me over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like last year was really good
because it was about people that wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are the suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the hybrid people like me,
where I deal with the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't consider myself a suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at a certain point, just like your
dad, I would say that he has to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of suits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at a certain point, once you're
growing and developing a business,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to shake hands and get down with
the certain crowds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think being able to fit in in both
of those situations is definitely part of
[SPEAKER_05]: what makes us successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, I would way
rather hang out with this cannabis group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like that in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Germany is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these, not all of the other
events, but a lot of the other events,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have that 2010 vibe, like 2000 West
Coast event vibe, where we had high times
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups and emerald cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the money was secondary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you see these events like MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the money is first,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that kind of speaks on the
entire industry in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once anywhere that's gone recreational at
this point, it kind of draws in the wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: People seem to look at cannabis as almost
like their golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, this is my identity now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to make a bunch of money off
of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no true passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, their passion is coming from the
wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why this show is good,
because we get so many passionate people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are beyond that, or they were before
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see the value of cannabis for
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so much more than money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a byproduct of amazing
cannabis, I think, that slowly but surely
[SPEAKER_00]: this market with recreational is kind of
going in a bad direction in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the people that are really
passionate, they would do it whether there
[SPEAKER_00]: was no money or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, it's become a pretty volatile
and ruthless industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people who are getting really
competitive about it and bottoming out the
[SPEAKER_05]: prices in the market, those aren't the
people at the end of the day that are
[SPEAKER_05]: really just truly passionate about the
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sucks, because the reality of that
is it's weeded out a lot of really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really amazing people who were highly
dedicated to cultivating in a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_05]: way with our local areas and truly just
doing it to produce the medicine that they
[SPEAKER_05]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also getting rid of the really
bad growers too, which that's the part I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some friends that were just getting
by on middle grade flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're producing stuff for $650 a pound
and you can't sell it for $7, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just in a bad place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The margins definitely aren't what they
used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not even close to what they
used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a real strong struggle for a
lot of people and a lot of good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's been a hard process to watch,
because for me, I grew up in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_05]: Triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so cannabis was always just a major
aspect of my community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something that I never even thought
twice about until probably my first dare
[SPEAKER_05]: class.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, this isn't just another
vegetable, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was treated like that as a kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was just a communal commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the economy in Humboldt was really
based around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the late 70s on, it just grew
momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the whole, it's what built
Humboldt County, Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the economy was based
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an amazing, beautiful thing too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because for me, it was like, I grew up
just watching all of the growers seriously
[SPEAKER_05]: support the local community on their
backs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it came to our nonprofits and our
school fundraisers, it was the grower
[SPEAKER_05]: families that were there supporting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though we might not have been
paying conventional taxes, the money came
[SPEAKER_05]: around.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was definitely some people who were
in and out and didn't invest in the local
[SPEAKER_05]: economy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, I think now you
can really see the difference that it made
[SPEAKER_05]: in the area, because businesses are
struggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a major effect now that things
have shifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's definitely sad to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's part of what made me grow up to
know and love what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cannabis industry as a whole so
much was just seeing the way it kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: tied everybody together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of my favorite stories is our
annual pie auction.
[SPEAKER_05]: At our school.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was always this crazy competitive
thing where whatever grower dad had the
[SPEAKER_05]: best harvest, he was buying an $800 pie
that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do it auction style.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'd be going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd be like, I'll do $500.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the way of giving back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a little bit more authentic and
direct than the way things are handled
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know as a cannabis business,
I don't get the choice of allocating my
[SPEAKER_05]: tax money where I would like it to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back then in Humboldt, that was kind
of how it went.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were like, I want to support the
school.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to support the local nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_05]: My stepmom still works for EPIC,
which is Environmental Protection
[SPEAKER_05]: Information Center.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said back then they would come in
and growers would just drop off a bag of
[SPEAKER_05]: cash anonymously and be like, I want no
credit, nothing else, but there's the
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just here to take care of my local
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe some people didn't pay
conventional taxes, but they did prison
[SPEAKER_00]: sentences for us to get to the point where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're very short-sighted
sometimes, especially these people that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't here before and now have come in
as investors or come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what it was like before
or the struggles that people went through
[SPEAKER_00]: to get us to the point where we're at now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, I grew up with my dad as
a grower, but he always kind of had his
[SPEAKER_05]: side job.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was for the county and he was doing
local freshwater surveys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was great that he did that,
but at the end of the day, it was such a
[SPEAKER_05]: hidden thing at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just seeing the way that it
shifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't really talk about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was definitely a lot more like a
forbidden topic, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone knew that it was there and
everyone was kind of doing it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but nobody was discussing it in the ways
that we do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On podcasts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still feels foreign to me sometimes
when I sit down or start talking about it
[SPEAKER_05]: or see a camera rolling around at our
farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, this feels a little off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have all these dispensaries now
and it's like, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: someone posted the other day, I think it
was Maya from Ohm was posting about how
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of people that
she thinks it's a superior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's in a lot of ways,
it's a superior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason for that is most
people never get to experience outdoor in
[SPEAKER_00]: its peak and its prime when it's at the
perfect time after it's harvested and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a short little window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were like, well,
indoor is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, okay, well, indoor is
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it looks better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, have you ever had a freshly
cured fire jar of outdoor?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you'd say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not all about looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Instagram has kind of
perpetuated this thing that it has to look
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, yeah, we eat with our eyes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, people are looking
at stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want stuff that looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the best stuff I grew up with,
it didn't look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made you feel amazing or it tasted
absolutely amazing or both.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had, yeah, I mean, I've had like,
you know, big phenol hunts every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It ends up getting narrowed down to major
taste test time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen so many samples where I
wouldn't have necessarily gone and picked
[SPEAKER_05]: it out of a jar on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I try it and it's like that flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, it hits right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how else to say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: It checks all the boxes for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had some amazing indoor too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had some great mix light.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, it's something
that's never really made that much sense
[SPEAKER_05]: to me to put things in an artificial
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, expect it to produce to its
full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think hiding from the police is
why we did it originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And had we not had to do that,
it would be a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still love good indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke mostly indoor, but this time of
year is when like the good outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like, we're starting to see
amazing outdoor coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like through the end of the year,
it's going to be at its peak and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at a plant, when you're
phenol hunting, a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think you can just walk through the
field and pick the winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's not that easy half the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that I think is amazing that
checks all the other boxes when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the smoke test, it's like, sometimes
it's a big letdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times it doesn't translate in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, I mean, we get a lot of
questions about this because, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we do our massive phenol hunts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was, you know, one of the few
things that we took from the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like actually stoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, we can actually look at 10,000
plants in a field now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that we never had
access to before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely weren't blowing up your
gorilla grow with 10,000 plants at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, it definitely expanded
our horizon, but that's the first step in
[SPEAKER_05]: my process.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I go and I try to eliminate certain
factors, I smell it, I look for things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I know I like or, you know,
whatever trait we're looking for in a
[SPEAKER_05]: particular cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, there's so much more
to it after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you have to go test it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the time, your eyes telling you
something completely different than,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, what your actual results are
gonna be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's definitely a major
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 10,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a, most people wouldn't even
understand what it looks like to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 plant phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can't really smoke
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to eliminate a whole bunch of
stuff right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if I'm gonna like just average up
numbers, it's crazy because I take two
[SPEAKER_05]: clones off of every plant too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first year we did the big 10,000
plant hunt, we had 20,000 clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to keep them alive for like,
you know, a month and a half, two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, shit, this is kind of
stressful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, at the end of the day,
we ended up killing 99% of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe keeping like 50 or 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like, you know, what we narrow
it down to every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it progresses onto the next steps
of the process, which of course is
[SPEAKER_05]: testing, smoking, growing them in
different environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once it passes every single one of
those categories, that's when you actually
[SPEAKER_05]: have a winner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, you know, we, we can't walk
out into the field and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a winner and this is going to be
the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, you guys are working on
early finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys are working on triploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard, I've heard all kinds of
amazing stuff that you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we try to keep it interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's one of the fun things
about breeding is it's a constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: evolving industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, there's always something
new and fun to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: The triploids was definitely a cool one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think ploidy in general is a fun thing
to play with overall.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a lot of success with that and
other crops like watermelons,
[SPEAKER_05]: strawberries, for example, are like an
octoploid, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's something that is a
major tool in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I also find that just
looking and tasting and sampling is
[SPEAKER_05]: honestly like more successful for,
you know, having amazing results than
[SPEAKER_05]: taking a hundred percent the scientific
route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't pencil out at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it has to be even like 50-50 of
both, I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to take a super scientific approach
to our breeding, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, you have to, you know,
seriously be into consuming cannabis to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually successfully phenol hunt or find
anything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tests will only tell you so much about
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we take a whole bunch
of data points when we're phenohunting and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's really,
you got to pass this smoke test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think more and more
people want early finishers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can narrow it down to stuff
that finishes early because everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to beat everybody else to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's wild.
Classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it seems like it kind of it's
like the pendulum always swings different
[SPEAKER_05]: ways, in my opinion, because we work with
a lot of outdoor farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so particularly with outdoor,
you see the differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: One year we get a lot of early rain and
people are like, fuck the early strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: All my late stuff came out the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: One year, you know, we end up having a
super late winter and their early shit is
[SPEAKER_05]: just super prime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's it's funny to see the way it
shifts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, there are a lot of
different like environmental factors that
[SPEAKER_05]: you consider with outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, it's just what
feels right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's something to be said for
long flowering varieties, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think that ignoring those is just
I don't know where it's stupid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that like we get so stuck into
some that we basically bottleneck
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves into these things like purple
candy gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all going to be purple candy gas
until the trend gets blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything's that for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to go in another
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the best way to do is go
in all these different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the market pivots,
you can shift from one to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really like longer flying varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the effect of sativas, not all
sativas, but same thing with not all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the shorter flowering varieties,
the wider leaf varieties that are the more
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them I like and some I just it's
not for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can definitely see where you're coming
from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a good sativa when it's the
right time for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like White Thorn Rose is another one
I really like that's really gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, everybody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our producer was telling me he bumped into
somebody recently and asked him what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were buying from the dispenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like White Thorn Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one is a really honestly amazing
strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has super unique terpene profile in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I call it feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I really like is when
something just checks that feel good box
[SPEAKER_00]: where like I could smoke it in the
morning, the afternoon, evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it checks that sedative box
or that really won the stimulant side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like right there where it's like,
okay, it makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like most people in the world,
if they were able to experience and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the same feeling that I get from that,
they would really like weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The THC thing, as much as it is relevant,
it's something that it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: driving the entire world of breeding at
this time, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've never gone out and been super
amazed by a plant just because I think
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to have high THC, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 37%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet there are some 37% varieties that I
think are absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then 37%, because the testing is all
over the place from one lab to the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, what is 37% really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's another thing that's a
serious concern, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not meant to be a for-profit industry
if you want accurate test results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's become competitive,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing you know, you have one lab
calling you up being like, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you 10% higher than this guy if
you switch over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the second it's incentivized,
it's an incentive for people to cheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: to falsify the records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm not big on government
oversight with anything except for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need more oversight on testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, testing for pesticides and all
that stuff, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, when it comes to percentages
and stuff like that, I think that there
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be run by the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a little bit hate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like that's the one thing where
we need to take away anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: incentivizes people to lie about the
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody wants a leg up on their
competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel the same way because as a
breeder, it's actually seriously
[SPEAKER_05]: inconvenient to have labs falsifying
numbers, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've straight up had labs call us and be
like, well, what THC percentage were you
[SPEAKER_05]: expecting to get on this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you want, basically?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, we want you to tell us
what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, OK, it's going to be an
extra week.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, that's kind of concerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pivoting to do everything in-house
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we will have third-party testing
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like in-house is the best
because then you can get results as fast
[SPEAKER_00]: as you need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could have a consistent method,
to be honest, because even just things as
[SPEAKER_05]: simple as adjusting your moisture content
when you're running the liquid
[SPEAKER_05]: chromatograph is going to change your
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally skews it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the drier it is, the higher the
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have an orange photonics that
we used quite often.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was just one of the first things
we noticed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so easy to skew your results just
with the tiniest little changes on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of inevitable that there is
always going to be the desire to get
[SPEAKER_05]: higher numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do agree that I think it needs to be
more heavily regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way at this point I feel
comfortable with any data we collect is if
[SPEAKER_05]: we're running it ourselves or making sure
that it's done the exact same way with the
[SPEAKER_05]: exact same moisture content every single
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many variables that you have to
keep track of in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it makes it so hard to go from state
to state doing it the right way in metric,
[SPEAKER_00]: going from state to state, because all
these labs are so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they get test results are not only
how they get test results, but how they
[SPEAKER_00]: prep the samples and where they get the
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states, you give them the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, like California, they pick it from
a batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, there's no consistency
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's kind of a joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I've even noticed things
like different test results on the same
[SPEAKER_05]: branch, but it's just a different but.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really is hard to pinpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see outrageous stuff these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard outrageous numbers multiple
times now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 45, 50% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wouldn't that melt?
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't even be a solid butt at that
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just be mush.
[SPEAKER_00]: One maybe it's because somebody put a
whole bunch of keef on the plate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another classic one I've heard of
is people are just rolling their butt in
[SPEAKER_05]: some keef right before they send it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember the hash they tested in
the forties, not only 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like 40% hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they say there's 50% flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's just, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, eh, the math ain't math.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and there's so much stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing your field runs and
you guys are smelling plants, do you smell
[SPEAKER_00]: the side branches or the top branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to do like a little bit of both to
be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally I'll go for the,
it depends on how tall the plant is,
[SPEAKER_05]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I generally end up going for the
sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 12 footers, you're probably not going
for the center core.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely no tops in that situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as much as smell is like one of the
number one things we're looking for in
[SPEAKER_05]: that situation, there's also so many other
variables that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it comes down to it, it's like,
you can kind of, you know, once you're
[SPEAKER_05]: walking through, you can kind of eliminate
a few things just automatically by walking
[SPEAKER_05]: by you're like, that one has a shit
structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's doing weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it molded early, whatever it is,
you're eliminating a few things as you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, then you walk up to one that
just kind of just a jaw dropper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like, you know, that's what I
like to call the unicorn plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, that's when you actually
look deeper into it and start taking data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm all up in that shit when it comes
down to those ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, once I find the one we're
sitting there, I'm, you know, evaluating
[SPEAKER_05]: its structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm evaluating the trichome density.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm evaluating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, terpene strength, of course,
mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's a lot of different
factors for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's a labor of love,
but I would like to say that I probably
[SPEAKER_05]: smell top to bottom when it comes down to
a really good one.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about those unicorns and doing
phenohunts that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually really do get to see a lot of
unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you pop a hundred seeds and
you get that 1%, but if you're going for
[SPEAKER_00]: that 1% of 10,000, that's a hundred
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hundred special things out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like most of the time you're
going to find 1% that's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with smaller hunts too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like, especially if I know my
lines and I kind of know the direction I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going for, I could pop 20 seeds of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know what I'm looking for that I've
made before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, well, what I'm looking
for is going to be found in probably at 20
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes more, sometimes less,
but it's just depending on how well you
[SPEAKER_00]: know your lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely agree with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, yeah, for us, it's really
with phenohunting it's we're looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's just a total anomaly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, a lot of the time it isn't a
perfect representation of a combination of
[SPEAKER_05]: the parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that went way off in a
different track.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recessive stuff that just pops out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what makes it special.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what makes it exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one thing I always have to
remind our crews that we phenohunt with is
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, please do not rate every plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you need to use your better
judgment a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the process of elimination and,
you know, kind of pick and choose as you
[SPEAKER_05]: go, because not every single one out of
this field of 2000 plants deserves to get
[SPEAKER_05]: written up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much work that goes into
working on that many plants and having
[SPEAKER_00]: them grown correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like with indoor, it's easy to grow
them out multiple times to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the outdoor, it's like you can
grow them, but it takes a whole nother
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if you're depping them,
it's a little different too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do multiple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what we usually do is we'll,
you know, do the big mega outdoor hunt and
[SPEAKER_05]: then we take our winners and, you know,
we're actually just starting this process
[SPEAKER_05]: right now from this last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we have them in clone form.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like this big at the point that we
found the winners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then, you know, we finally get a
couple cuts off of them essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we flower those out indoor just to do
the second process of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing if they actually work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a totally different environment and,
you know, there can also just be different
[SPEAKER_05]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally different expressions sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better or worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just kind of have to see, you kind of
have to see all angles at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my preference is to, you know,
do outdoor mix light, depth, indoor,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we normally do all of that R&D before
we ever even release it to the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot more that goes into it
than just going out there and picking a
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and being like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sometimes the show is that simple,
but then it wouldn't be as fun.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd heard of Humboldt seeds,
heard of you guys for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then the first time I ran any of your
gear was blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I was given blueberry muffin from
someone in Sacramento as DJ Short's
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it out and I'm like,
this is not DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: People always ask us if it's crossed with
his and we're like, if you know his
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry, then you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some breeding with it too,
but that was like, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you guys are onto something with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was a really special one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those like, like I said,
just anomaly plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I, you know, it was way back when
I think 2010 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we were doing the big
outdoor grow and we had our whole crew and
[SPEAKER_05]: our manager up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a bunch of the trimmers went up to
harvest and they literally like stopped
[SPEAKER_05]: dead harvesting that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, this smells just like
blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we need to set this aside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure enough, my dad fell in love with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the structure is amazing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the color of the structure,
the smell, I mean, the smoke, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: about it just, it kind of checks all the
boxes and it's a good breeder too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that way too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, that one's a nostalgic
strain for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always say it's kind of my favorite,
but it's like probably the first thing I
[SPEAKER_05]: ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up just even smelling it just
around the house or in the dry rooms and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, that one definitely always has a
special place in my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one that you smoke a joint of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It translates all the way through the
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like that, not a lot of stuff
does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of things out there that
do, but that's definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's like it hits your tongue and
sometimes I'm like, was that even weed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it tastes like you're eating a
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even feel it in your throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just this creamy like sweetness.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you guys have crossed and made
lines out of that and done some breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of your new stuff that even
has that in it is one of the parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely have played a lot with the
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one that we get a lot of demand for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we have our, blueberry
cupcake, which is kind of like the new
[SPEAKER_05]: rendition of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blueberry muffin times wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of just has that like bag
appeal frost layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really add any new terps,
maybe a little bit of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: bready cakiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's tough though, when you have
something that's that profound and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that different, kind of like how Skittles
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like how Skittles, basically
Skittles is the apex of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you look at the cross at the
S1, and the Skittles crosses, is there
[SPEAKER_00]: anything really better than Skittles as
Skittles in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's, you know, there's people
that argue this and that, but like really
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is the one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I have to absolutely agree there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, there's no point in
chasing the hype train, especially in the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding world anymore at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so like constantly changing and,
you know, it's unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an unpredictable market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm proud personally think,
you know, for us, we just like to stick to
[SPEAKER_05]: what we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the classic blueberry muffin is the
one that I know and love.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I don't think blueberry cupcake
or any of the new crosses are ever going
[SPEAKER_05]: to change my opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like, yeah, especially with
something so nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like I can, you know, I'll smell
the bag from fucking 50 feet away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that's the muffin.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we just harvested our seed
chamber of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I wasn't actually even
there for the harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to go close up the dry shed
container.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I immediately, as soon as I opened the
door, I'm like blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure rosin, I don't think I've smoked
any blueberry muffin rosin, but I bet you
[SPEAKER_00]: it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes great, but it's not a good
yielder, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best ones aren't like,
I mean, Skittles doesn't yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Skittles yields okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Skittles is super high in turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's decent for rosin, washes like shit,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, there's a lot of people who
still do it because it's so worth it for
[SPEAKER_05]: that, her profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, you know, it's uncanny
muffin smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like Skittles, rosin,
people do stuff that yields twice or three
[SPEAKER_00]: times as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, sometimes it's worth it
just for that flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I love the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's honestly, I was super stoked when
you said that that's what you had to
[SPEAKER_05]: sample today because that's one of,
if I had to pick a favorite that isn't a
[SPEAKER_05]: Humble Seed Company strain, I think that'd
be one of my top ones.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's something special about
Skittles and it's like, it's the flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's lighter on the effect and
sometimes I like stronger, sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: like more sativa leaning stuff,
but Skittles has its own thing and I enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking really good Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, it's like one thing,
it's in the arsenal and I'm always,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I get a fresh bag of it, I smoke it
until it's not fresh anymore and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: move on to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, it's real easy to just smoke
joints and Skittles all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to taste the first one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here is two different joints
that I've rolled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grown in the same environment
with everything the same, except for the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one that was grown with soil and
one that was grown with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to do a trial here to
see which one you prefer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get to know which one's which yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would ruin the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm, I'm curious as to see if
you get the same results that I got
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday and you know, I get excited
about stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, so we've been R&Ding because
we're going in metric with joints next
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been R&Ding a whole bunch of
different styles, machine rolled versus
[SPEAKER_00]: hand rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the hand rolled the best,
but as far as convenience and cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tough, but it's got to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to check all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's so many different
sizes, different tips, different papers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different things that you can do
to make a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, we want the
best product out there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so research and development.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much more than just having good
flour when you have a product like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll, but I feel like convenience is
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty tasty, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different things that you
can do to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can change the diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go from a 10 millimeter to a 12
millimeter, 10, 10 millimeter to a 12
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter and using the same paper and
same crutch, everything, and it burns
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter with the bigger millimeter,
like significantly to where you can taste
[SPEAKER_00]: more turps if it's a little bit thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I like these big monster
joints, like three and a half grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like, if you're going for,
for turps, like this, the smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily when is this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets smaller than this and
it's not as turpy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to find that perfect middle ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that, that hit really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say, honestly, it's good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's come time that we
actually start doing like serious
[SPEAKER_05]: comparative analysis and real R and D,
you know, cause before it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone has their theories and they're
like, this is the way, but there's so much
[SPEAKER_05]: science out there, but you know,
that's, it's one thing I have like
[SPEAKER_05]: actually been enjoying lately is seeing,
you know, people put the proof in the
[SPEAKER_05]: pudding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think is the phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it takes a lot of effort and
time and a significant amount of money to
[SPEAKER_00]: do proper R and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't understand that
what exactly goes into a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a lot of time and energy and
a lot of passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you have to put out a lot of
money before you get any return on that
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but you're doing it because you
want the best product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we get that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just even with strain releases,
people see us do a phenol hunt and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: like, can I get it now?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, yeah, give us three or
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's companies that put out
400 new crosses a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, they're not doing the R and
D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, we make, we make 300 out
crosses a year, but we probably only
[SPEAKER_00]: release 50, maybe at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's on a, that's usually a combined
effort of multiple years of breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're like, okay, we've tested this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tested this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like this and this, but, uh,
you know, it's like, and there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies and different models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's no one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I mean, there's the right way,
but what the right way is for each person
[SPEAKER_00]: is so different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I always make the comparison
when it comes to breeding and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, strain development, you would
think of breeding dogs, for an example,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, you're not going to cross
two different breeds of dogs, a poodle and
[SPEAKER_05]: a pug together and, you know, immediately
have super uniform babies, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect result.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like as much as, you know,
I admire anybody who wants to do
[SPEAKER_05]: pollination projects and experiment with
breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, make their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's not, in my opinion,
how the process should be carried out.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're, we're working with unstable
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we're already working with
this mutt for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like getting to a point where it's
stable takes a lot of work and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and you're getting rid of a lot of
stuff to find the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, okay, we cross these two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the model now,
but I don't see that being the model of
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your dad and you guys definitely
don't see that as the model of the future
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like the stuff I see from
Instagram is, you know, you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in the real work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, it's been a time
consuming process, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, you know, really special that my
dad kind of saw that he had a passion in
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started from him working in salmon
genomics and then he shifted into breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: his own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, I mean, this is an
assumption, but I think he was probably
[SPEAKER_05]: getting some unreliable genetics back
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, I have a gorilla grow to
run and a family to feed all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I need stable, reliable seed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, that's what sparked the
whole thing, but it's also meant that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've had the ability to build our lines
for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, stability is obviously
an important thing for us, but I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that's just generally the expectation of,
you know, an advanced breeding company is
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I don't buy corn from the grocery
and expect it to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: five different kinds and different colors
and one sweet and one tastes like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corn is, it's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, we have two types of corn
now that are available in grocery stores
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet there's so many different types of
corn out there in existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But accessibility is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to think here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to test them as many times as
you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your dad got some grants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the first people I've heard
of that got some grants to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think research and development.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for fish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for fish.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was always really passionate about
salmon preservation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of what I grew up with
his, you know, official job being was the,
[SPEAKER_05]: he was the director for the salmon river
restoration council for awhile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wrote a bunch of grants while he
was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, he's, he's always been
really, really, really passionate about
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just recently also had the,
the wonder of seeing the Klamath Dams be
[SPEAKER_05]: taken out, which was like what I kind of
grew up with him fighting for it
[SPEAKER_05]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was a huge part of my
childhood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would go to all the little protests
at Pacific core and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: hold algae up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had my like fish puppet that I'd put
around and I lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already stoned to the shits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as preference, which one did you
like the better taste of?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess is the effect now we've smoked
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I like the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is soil grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like perfumey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's Skittles, but it's like,
it's like two levels higher than the cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's still got the candy and
everything, but it almost has like this
[SPEAKER_01]: perfume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got this perfume flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping I picked the soil one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are the kinds of tests that
everybody should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I do like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do smoke a lot of cocoa, but like seeing
Skittles like this is really, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to me, that's pretty obvious that
soil makes a better product as far as I
[SPEAKER_00]: did the effect test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoked them a few hours ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few hours apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I smoked them a few hours apart
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay, the soil definitely
has a stronger effect, but it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: as much of a come down and crash either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it lifts you up and then it
makes you feel really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just go down gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like the effect from the other
one, I felt like I smoked it a bunch and
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't as strong, but I definitely felt
it after I hadn't smoked for like 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them or both of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's doing the trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely got me stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from humble, did you go to
college?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I kind of just messed around and
took some classes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like right as legalization kind of
hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was in school for business at the
time and I was working with my dad also
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty consistently, like basically full
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the got to the point where I was
just like, I'm learning like five times
[SPEAKER_05]: more working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like hands-on with my dad every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ended up just kind of going with that
route instead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was obviously what I wanted to do
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't necessarily what I imagined
doing right when I graduated high school.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always kind of our like low key.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a little side business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing you know, it was like our
whole entire reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2018 to now where it went from
recreational to today, it's changed so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had lack of stability maybe from 2013
to 2018 as well, but it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's been a wild ride for me,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't ever really imagine that it was
gonna go in this direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, for our brand to have made
it this far, it's kind of mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have had seeds in smoke shops and
you guys have kind of, you were at a
[SPEAKER_00]: champs trade show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we were.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a lot of different events.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to be like, you know, as well
exposed as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we like check out new areas when they
start.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did Mary Jane Berlin this year,
which was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you went to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't go, but I heard it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have gone because it sounds
like it was like one of the best events.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep hearing that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so exciting to go and,
you know, be able to spend time with
[SPEAKER_05]: people in these like new areas that
haven't necessarily like experienced the
[SPEAKER_05]: world of cannabis as we know it today in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're all just, you know,
so genuine and excited, enthusiastic and
[SPEAKER_05]: can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not jaded yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everybody's a little jaded by
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over there, I mean, I go to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I go to the Caribbean with Marlon
Asher, who I think I met you the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time actually was backstage in a slightly
stupid show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember which one,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Marlon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was performing with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marlon's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to the Caribbean on Friday
to gift the country seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the minister of agriculture is letting
us import seeds in the country and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go gift them to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made some crosses in 2019, 2020 and 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some banana crosses a while
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we brought those for the island and
it should be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a really exciting trip.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely feel like times are really
changing and like having situations like
[SPEAKER_05]: that happening is something I never would
have imagined as a little kid that was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you know, scared to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government is very like supportive of
cannabis there, which is so different than
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like here we're just kind of
a thorn in the side of the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over there, the government has the
cannabis authority and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we help our people and make our
people better?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we use this plant as medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medical over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look at it from a medicinal
standpoint, but there's really passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just so different than the
government here in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know it's, it's interesting,
like the approach that, but you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the American way, I guess this
industry for profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much energy out there in the
world for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the really special thing about seeds
is just seeing how they travel like that
[SPEAKER_05]: and the way that you can have a seed come
from, you know, Northern California and go
[SPEAKER_05]: change somebody's life in a totally
different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have one big plant that has
10,000 seeds on it and where those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: go and how much, you know, that changes
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like cannabis makes the world a
better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in making seeds, you're doing that
exponentially, which is pretty wild when
[SPEAKER_00]: you like really dive into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely mind blowing to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still constantly have to second guess
and question like, if it's all even real
[SPEAKER_05]: because places I've never even dreamed of
that I'm seeing people growing our seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how it brings everybody
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can be totally the other end of
the spectrum for whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you can like heavy metal
music or Grateful Dead music, and you both
[SPEAKER_00]: like weed and you get along real easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, it just brings,
it's like, kind of like food is like that
[SPEAKER_00]: too, how it just brings people together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I have a big passion for combining
weed and food.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like two of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it is because it's like such,
you know, it's similar vibes that it
[SPEAKER_05]: really just draws everyone together.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're, you're not focused on the other
bullshit for just a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just stoned and having a good
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both make people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right there with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I'm not really big on putting
cannabis in my food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking and I like eating and I
like keeping them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was a chef and I really love
food and I love cannabis, but together
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, you know, I grew up eating
brownies and drinking crazy drinks that
[SPEAKER_00]: had cannabis in them that were super
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it's like, I always been like,
you eat it and then it makes you feel high
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour later, an hour and a half later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like enjoying the food with my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely kind of have to agree with
you on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been like the big edibles
person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is about me,
but I can't even get high off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you eat a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried like so many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really genuinely have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard it's like some digestive
enzyme potentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some report that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, but you're not
the first person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So K from Trichome Technologies,
he's another amazing breeder slash extract
[SPEAKER_00]: artist slash the guy who the reason they
do the extraction they do or the we as a
[SPEAKER_00]: society and as a community, the reason we
do it the way we do it today is from K
[SPEAKER_00]: from Trichome Technologies and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She could eat a thousand milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I realize there's something
definitely wrong when I like started
[SPEAKER_05]: recommending stuff to friends and I was
like, Oh, it's really mellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate two last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: She ended up having an entire panic attack
and got just so high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, this is a girl that smokes a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's definitely something a
little wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body chemistries are also uniquely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how edibles can affect people
so differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can like, for me,
I can smoke all day long and then go eat
[SPEAKER_00]: an edible and I'm toast from 20
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then other people, 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people have bad trips on 500
milligrams too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some people get really messed up
off of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had the experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'm gonna say a little curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never felt like so high that I'm like
really unhappy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to eat a whole bunch of
mushrooms and do a whole bunch of caffeine
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and maybe that would be
comparable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mushrooms affect you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a bummer if mushrooms didn't
affect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that'd be a rough one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is about edibles that
just, they've never like really fully
[SPEAKER_05]: transpired.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had multiple times where I've
like eaten them with people and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: freaking the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, so it's definitely come to
the conclusion that there's something
[SPEAKER_05]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Body chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just been exposed to it so much for
so long that it just doesn't get you
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what I wonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, did I eat too many edibles when
I was a child or something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like on a child, but you know,
high school days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being around cannabis all the time,
you know, it's like you were exposed to it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a very young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started smoking when I was 14 and
right away I knew that was, it was the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that changed my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, I'll stick with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried psychedelics first because I was
scared to smoke because I ran cross
[SPEAKER_00]: country in high school and I was really
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried acid first in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really good stuff, but then once I
finally tried cannabis, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is, this is the stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of how it went for me too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, okay, I know what I'm going to
stick to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been like a more of a,
I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My drugs to be grown in the ground,
kind of a person raw form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the shrooms and the weed were
like the person
[SPEAKER_05]: raw form for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good combo too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, you know, mushrooms,
I don't, I don't eat mushrooms all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but I go through waves where I eat
them more often than other times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people are microdosing stuff and I
feel like that's just, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never microdosed back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always like an eighth or a half an
eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done anything like that in a
long time, but I feel like, I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the microdosing like a little more
casual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through my face, like reggae in the
river.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at reggae.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go to reggae this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did go to reggae.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were with cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal golden cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should do the booth with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to convince my dad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my big thing is like, so I was at
Cannifest too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to support all the local events
that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great going to spandibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great going to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great going to Chile, all these
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when people in Humboldt, Mendocino,
Sonoma, you know, you guys are watching
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to support you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannifest was amazing this year too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a judge of the rosin category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was bummed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had gotten back to town like for the
last day and I ended up just so so sick
[SPEAKER_05]: that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And poor Nat, he actually like pulled
through and stuck it out and was hanging
[SPEAKER_05]: out there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Teal and Friends played.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was pissed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you guys focused on for the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're focused on so many different
things, but is there any, you guys are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going even more globe wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're just, you know, experimenting
in new areas and, you know, there tends to
[SPEAKER_05]: be kind of a calling for us now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially in like, you know,
places near Europe, Germany kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately kind of took off and knew who
we were.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really cool to just be able
to, you know, go in there and actually get
[SPEAKER_05]: them the seeds they've been wanting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macedonia is popping off now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even hear about that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal, Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all these countries going
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it's going to be like,
you know, pretty global eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just a whole nother ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia is going to be tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious about how Asia does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for it all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then India, we got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically testing a bunch of
genetics from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the other like fun part about,
you know, going to these different areas
[SPEAKER_05]: is just seeing how they cultivate and like
what they've had going on, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: up until now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like California kind of always
does retain like a major market influence.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whether we're leading it in a
good direction is a serious question,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it is definitely like the kind of,
you know, inspiration and starting point
[SPEAKER_05]: for any friends in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I shouldn't say that there's going to
be people from other places that have
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely had impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: West Coast, California, like you see that
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they have cannabis and they know what
you're talking about pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not all over India, but a lot of
places like Cali weed is the weed to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like, I mean, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: It surprises me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we have, you know, people reaching
out to us all the time from the most
[SPEAKER_05]: random places and they barely know the top
end strains in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, okay, like, I mean,
it is where the best stuff originated and
[SPEAKER_05]: not to get our own horn too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it's, I think it's earned
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild how social media and things like
Facebook and Instagram have really had an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on our industry too, because people
were able to see stuff from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and they're able to get influenced
by stuff so heavily where it's at the
[SPEAKER_00]: phone, the push of a finger, you're
looking at different flower and different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures and you know, it's really opened
the doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good and bad, but I think that's one
of the good things is like people were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to see all these different things
that people are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, it's, it's been
revolutionary for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's interesting just, you know,
having a brand that was a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_05]: word of mouth and you know, like very
under wraps and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: going and being able to actually talk
about it has like made the world of a
[SPEAKER_05]: difference, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I definitely, I definitely am just
grateful to have been able to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, see my dad take like all of his
projects and actually be able to share
[SPEAKER_05]: them with the world because, you know,
he, he's a humble, mellow guy and he just
[SPEAKER_05]: loves to just hang out on the farm and
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if it wasn't for
legalization happening at the time it did,
[SPEAKER_05]: like he, you know, might just still be up
there with absolutely no recognition
[SPEAKER_05]: whatsoever for, you know, the bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that when you guys knew it was going
to be a real business was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: once recreational hit?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, he already had made a business
license for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like way back it was, you know,
he had the name written up as just a seed
[SPEAKER_05]: company for vegetables in general in like
2001.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was, you know, it was something he
planned for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he got the, you know,
domain a while later and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: never really did much with it online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing you know, legalization came
after like just quite a while of him
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding for, you know, all the homies and
a few different orders around with like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, tiny little business card
packages that we would shrink wrap on with
[SPEAKER_05]: the little vile in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, it was good times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was classic, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you guys save a bunch of the original
stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have some little bits and pieces
here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a little display case in our
office and we keep some pieces we lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to make this really cool calendar
and we can't find it, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone will have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone that's watching this show might
even happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how this show has come
through with stuff like that, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, the original calendars, my friends,
Josh, my friend, Josh Freeman from roots
[SPEAKER_00]: in harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bred the silverback gorilla and a bunch
of other genetics back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a string called the ripple plum that
was amazing, but he had this awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just found like those calendars were
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed calendars from, you know,
10, 20 years ago were all pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all these little pictures of
different strains we had at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, then there was a picture of
my dad in the back in one year and he had
[SPEAKER_05]: a full mask over his face and he's trying
to be all low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the way to do it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, it was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you really couldn't show
your face that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone had different names.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, there's a lot of bumps on
the road potentially if you messed up at
[SPEAKER_05]: all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, especially once that
committed, it's, you know, there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: going back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you get even just chopped one
year, it's going to fuck your whole
[SPEAKER_05]: family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was serious stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't anything he ever played around
with, but, you know, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: quotes from him actually is fortune favors
the cautiously bold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think that was kind of
his methodology was be careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you don't ever want to be
the biggest guy out there, but you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: want to be the smallest guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to be the smallest either.
[SPEAKER_05]: And always have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what was taught to me when I was
younger was I always have a backup plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortune does favor the bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying that my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I'm about to do something stupid,
I say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked out most of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I guess it's always a bet,
but I mean, in life, you have to take
[SPEAKER_00]: chances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are taking a chance with your
seed company, just like I'm doing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company and my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's definitely risk
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think small business owners have
huge balls and it takes a lot of risk and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of energy and a lot of commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost have to put everything into it
at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like seven days a week,
365 days a year, you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: business, even if you're not wanting to,
but that's the beauty, the blessing and
[SPEAKER_00]: the curse of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those things where once you're
like that hide into it, there's definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: no clocking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you can just turn it off,
but that's also what makes the business
[SPEAKER_05]: special in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that my dad has
definitely put a lot of time and personal
[SPEAKER_05]: energy into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a major inspiration for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's definitely taught me to be
able to figure shit out on my own and
[SPEAKER_05]: never be scared to attempt something,
even if, you know, it's a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I made his entire permit himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a book this big, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some days nobody's going to
come save you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn that quick in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's definitely a reality,
especially in a this industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hardly get people to call back
when they owe you a little check or
[SPEAKER_05]: something these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as bad as it used to be in some
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worse in other ways, but it's not as
bad as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember people, there's like
Humboldt time and then there's like normal
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to drive up to Humboldt and
I'll be like, I'll be back in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be like three days because
you're on Humboldt time and you go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the vortex waiting for people and waiting
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is before, you know, we had cell
phones back then, but not everybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: cell phones and everybody's scared to talk
on cell phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Humboldt was a special place for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely like nowhere else I really
know, but it's super special to me just,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the way that the whole entire
community has like been able to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, kind of stick together
throughout this whole process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, everyone has all but the
best intentions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they're not going to stop
trying to, you know, do what they love in
[SPEAKER_05]: the place that they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, they're going to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that I would like to see the
most of everything in California is farm
[SPEAKER_00]: to table tasting experiences, just like
they have in the wine industry for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that would help save Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would improve the quality of
life for the people in the industry up
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but like being able to go and get
the tasting experience go meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, go meet the breeders potentially,
go up during harvest season, watch them
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're starting to get bed and
breakfast, things like that, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, we need tasting rooms for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just silly that we don't have them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like be an attractive thing to do
for all the students that are coming in
[SPEAKER_05]: these days too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that I'm surprised hasn't been
done yet actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they made it so you can't do direct
sales too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the distribution model and
how it works and it is what it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel like there should be direct
sales or a way for these farms to do
[SPEAKER_00]: direct sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money's tight right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had to deal with over taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been definitely a tough uphill kind
of a battle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it was a lot of false
promise from the start at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day and it just became to a point where
it's not competitive if you're a small
[SPEAKER_05]: farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if you're massive and you have a
shit ton of grain houses going out once
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can sell packs all day for $300
and that's fine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're able to make a living that's
wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they can maybe deal with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: With all these loopholes and the crazy
stuff that they throw at us all the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they definitely were just pushing a
little too hard at the beginning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we kind of settled on something
that wasn't quite perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even wasn't quite perfect,
but was not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't the first in the US,
but being one of the first, we got to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how Washington did it and Colorado did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of those states did it perfect
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington has his own state of problems,
but there's still stuff we really got to
[SPEAKER_00]: get figured out for everyone to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only time will tell, I guess, but it's
also just kind of disheartening to see the
[SPEAKER_05]: way that it's ended up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but I'm one of those optimists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very optimistic with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I shouldn't be so optimistic,
but I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any other way to look at
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the balance sometimes with my
other partners and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: With optimism.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no, that's honestly the best
mindset to have about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the day, I think it will
come back around and things are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start to even out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything goes in waves,
so I feel like it's not going to be bad
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't the last time it's going to be
bad, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it'll get better and it'll get
worse and it'll get better and it'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just part of life and growing
pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I would do this even if I
wasn't getting paid to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just happy that I can get paid and
I can work in a place where I love what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't mind working seven days
a week when it's like we're working,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, my 18 year old self would give
me the big thumbs up for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like my 80 year old self,
we're still working on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I think my 18 year old self
would be totally blown away by the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm doing podcasts and I get to smoke
weed all the time and I get to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For work, you know, and get to try
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we're super fortunate to be
able to be in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, that's one thing that I,
you know, always am just insanely grateful
[SPEAKER_05]: for is, you know, actually having the
ability to do what I love and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, be able to do it in a place
where it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's highly regulated, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely a privilege.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I can't imagine being anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, something we get to do
kind of often is invite people just from
[SPEAKER_05]: other areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, the folks at our Barcelona
branch I mentioned earlier, and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they're not used to seeing what
we have here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're used to seeing, you know,
small scale usually like indoor grow
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so taking them out and showing them
like fields of plants just like growing
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're all in complete awe and
wonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, definitely something I
will never get tired of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a mutual uncle, Uncle Ed
Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncle Ed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys spend a lot of time with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent a lot of time with him in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been very influential for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see you guys have been taking him to
events with you and really taking good
[SPEAKER_00]: care of him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's so great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always have a great time having Ed
around, honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is such a trooper and will stay up as
late as I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like the last one up with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: He shows up and he is, you know,
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first I was like, this guy just
he's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he makes some interesting
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely a character.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is an absolute character.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, you know, at first I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, you know, is he just is he
just like pissed like right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he wants to debate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a debater.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was, you know, I honestly wasn't even
sure if he liked me at first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I've gotten to know
him pretty well over the last few years,
[SPEAKER_05]: just traveling around together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he is one of my favorite people to
travel with at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: He always has an amazing story about every
place we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he's the life of the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the life of the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's he's such a character.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, he smokes and he's
really passionate about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he just he loves cannabis on so many
different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has such crazy like he has this
collection of crazy facts in his head that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just come out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, blown away sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, he is he's definitely quite a
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he came from a time where you had
to think like what he was doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was everything was kind of outside the
box because nobody knew what the box was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were learning about the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he came with his writing and hit it
from all these different angles and had
[SPEAKER_00]: all these crazy concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were totally crazy and
some of them turned out to be actually
[SPEAKER_00]: genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, that's the that's the beauty
of Ed's work, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, inspiring for me to like
think about people who had to fight that
[SPEAKER_05]: battle and just to even explore what they
love and wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a fighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is, you know, he was relentless and,
you know, pursued his passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that I always will
admire about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be here for if it wasn't for
people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't be here doing what we do if it
wasn't for people like Ed going to court
[SPEAKER_00]: and fighting for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Writing books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my book, I pretty decent reading
book, but it's on the backs of guys like
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal, Jorge Cervantes,
Rob Clark, Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we had the joy of having all three
of those authors come out and be know that
[SPEAKER_05]: with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was, you know, really special for
me to have the opportunity to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: learn from those guys, because,
you know, they are such a relevant part
[SPEAKER_05]: of, you know, the culture we know and love
today and probably wouldn't be here
[SPEAKER_05]: without people who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the combined knowledge from those
three people, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob Clark is a wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's on a whole nother level.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one I look up to the most,
probably out of the people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reggie Gadino is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a friend and he wrote the forward in
my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there, you know, there's a lot of
people that kind of paved the path way to,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, bring us to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for that, I will always be grateful
because, you know, it definitely wasn't an
[SPEAKER_05]: easy road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you mentioned earlier, like people
did hard time for cannabis and a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people, you know, it still happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're still locking people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for me, that's the best part
of legalization is not putting people in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison for a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just it's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you can call them outlaws,
but don't call criminals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really was able to wrap my head
around that personally, either.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's something that's
always been kind of absurd to me because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like you look at alcohol and you know
that that actually kills multiple people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's highly dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you have some, you know,
like serious negative side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you compare it to cannabis,
which is you know, like at the point was
[SPEAKER_05]: getting people arrested, thrown in jail
for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that, you know, how is that even
comparable?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just never made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even as a kid, I was just like,
why is it that cannabis is bad?
[SPEAKER_05]: I never got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the problem is, is the cannabis
tunes you in and alcohol tunes you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the problem with alcohol is
that it tunes you out and it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It numbs you to the world where cannabis
kind of tunes you in and makes you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it makes the world
a much better place where alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think it's there and I think
people enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy alcohol sometimes, but I don't
think it necessarily makes the world a
[SPEAKER_00]: better place like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it gives people panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that, I mean, that's bad,
but I think that's the worst of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes you look at yourself from a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of opens the world up in a lot of
other ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a negative out of anything
if, you know, abused in the wrong way,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like just overall it was,
you know, it was the fact that one thing
[SPEAKER_05]: was totally socially acceptable and,
you know, everyone was doing it and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: legal and sold in all the stores and on
the shelves and, you know, and the next
[SPEAKER_05]: thing you know, it's like someone's
getting picked up with an ounce and
[SPEAKER_05]: getting thrown in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've got cases or cartons of
cigarettes and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an ounce of weed, man, that's put you
in jail for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, it's such a weird way of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's such a backwards way of
thinking that you look at a hundred years
[SPEAKER_00]: from now or a hundred years in the past,
maybe even, you know, you start going
[SPEAKER_00]: further in the past or further in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes zero sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but there's a lot of things right now
that are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in life is a bunch of failure to
get to the point where you're really good
[SPEAKER_00]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like also being willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a whole nother thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've just learned from so many
experiences where I'm like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to do auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I breed auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been breeding auto flowers for quite
a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, there was a point where I was
like auto flowers are garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never, I was in Spain and I saw auto
flowers that were this tall, that smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: like hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like 2010s, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I'm never doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, years later I see good
auto flowers and the next thing you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with people that are breeding
good auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, I'm breeding good
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a place for a bunch of
stuff, but to say that something's no
[SPEAKER_00]: good, it's like, sometimes you have to
look at it more than it's just no good.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something to be learned every time
you fail anyways, if you look at it that
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I don't think really any
grow is ever a failure in my book.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I'm, I am interested in,
you know, just about anything if I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can learn so much every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also data collection,
like you probably grew up with data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, I wouldn't say most people,
but a lot of people don't collect any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grow to grow, or at least that's
how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now slowly, but surely a lot of us
have really gone towards collecting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of data, as much data as possible,
because that's how you improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best way to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are like, what's not
natural is what somebody said the other
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, what is natural?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire evolution of cannabis is via
human assistance, essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't claim that that isn't
natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we get all sorts of funny stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have people tell us like the FEM seeds
are GMO and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't know if that qualifies,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, are the FEM seeds are bad to breed
with or the FEM seeds or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anything wrong with
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that regular seeds are good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a round of regular seeds every year
in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't do any regular breeding at
the facility ever because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a little bit of contamination
where it's like, okay, some FEM pollen go
[SPEAKER_00]: in something else, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very minimal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the difference with regs and
FEM pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't realize it takes a lot of
fucking work to get the same amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: feminized pollen, even nearly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a whole different ballpark,
but I can understand why you wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: regs around because those things will just
poof all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love working with male cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially the ones where they stack
tight, where you have these male flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just really tightly stacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the reversed plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting because you kind of get
to see the 50-50 where it will retain that
[SPEAKER_05]: bud structure versus the ones that are all
just fully hanging down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, yeah, it's like a
combination of both.
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost has the little spikes of pollen
pods just coming out like a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love shaking male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something special about seeing
dusts of pollen and realizing what that
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I have a big Instagram
following is because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I shook the plants and got
that dust cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but there's something special about
working with males and breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the time in with females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people, the female
breeding aspect of it, it's technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of timing involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a smaller window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really hit the window
perfectly, your seeds come out nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: even.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't, you're going to have a
bunch of white seeds, a bunch of yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, a bunch of lighter seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to hit a real short pollination
window when we do it and make sure there's
[SPEAKER_00]: way more than enough pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have redundancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use live plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we hang plants just trying to
get as much pollen in there with feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, it's tough because once
you're used to regular breeding for a
[SPEAKER_05]: little while, it's like, you know,
you just shake it once or twice and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to get a ton of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you switch over to the fems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, you know, it's a whole different
little world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the pollen, I think, just doesn't like
even release it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well, half the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't produce as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is that it produces a little less,
but I feel like sometimes they don't open
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they have like a tendency
to get like just the tiniest bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tiniest bit neutralizes it at that
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they just never open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain genetics just don't produce
barely any pollen or none.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them are so hard to get to flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had problems with blue germ till we
switched over to the nano silver that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another one where it's like an
easy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly easy to reverse and it creates
a decent amount of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's tricky too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what reversal methods do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, certain reversal methods
work better on certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's a lot of fun though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think, you know, as long as it's
not like a stress induced reversal,
[SPEAKER_05]: then I approve of that method.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, that's always going to
lead to, you know, potentially in breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: some like intersex traits in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're just stressing it out and seeing
if it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just getting herm seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can say that that's an effective
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, I've seen like,
you know, I've seen super, super
[SPEAKER_05]: successful fem breeding coming out
recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the autos that I have have
less than a 0.001% expression of intersex,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one in a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, fem seeds, it used to be like,
if you had nine out of 10, you were okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like one out of a thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it really has.
[SPEAKER_05]: The standard is, you know, always,
always going up as it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bar keeps moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like same thing with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's some people that are
just breeding the same gelatos,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, within that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budjilero they're from, uh, Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some really wild stuff with
long flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was at Canifest, I realized the
diversity up in Humboldt is way more than
[SPEAKER_00]: it is in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like so specific here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple, candy, gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go more gas and less candy,
but it's got to be purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of purple at the very least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up there you got, you still have a
good amount of variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the white thorn rose,
which kind of checks that box too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I love.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely, there's definitely
some really great like old school stuff up
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, a lot of people that just
like really, you know, keep their stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that they like to grow around rather than
chasing off like what's, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: going to look good in their bag,
I guess, because it's like half the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I swear in this stuff that,
you know, I've tried some things from
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries where I'm just like,
you know, this, this doesn't taste like
[SPEAKER_05]: anything at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much of that stuff that it's
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just missing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think some of the genetics
they've put in there, like Oreos is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of missing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they say cardboard turps,
but it's just kind of missing turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cardboard turps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and then purple punch is like the
big letdown for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I go to smoke purple punch and
if you grow it, it looks so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you do like a finger rub,
get a whole bunch of resin, smells pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you light a joint of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that initial joint you fire up is
like, Oh, it almost tastes like it might
[SPEAKER_00]: have something the next hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it just tastes like you might
as well smoke tobacco, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it doesn't really have any flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's never, that's never fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's see, that's what I contribute
to Instagram's contribution to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world is they've ruined the way
it's all about the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be the bag has to look
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be frosted and you can have
stuff that tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not super frosted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have stuff that tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not super beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to refocus on effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of my takeaway from the last six
months of I'd like re read or I changed
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, sometimes the boat goes to
the left or the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to get it back going straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think effect at the end of the day
needs to be the primary focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then terpenes is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's other things like
commercial viability, how many days does
[SPEAKER_00]: it finish it and all these things,
but like really going back to that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, you know, happy to see some
interest starting to gain traction and
[SPEAKER_05]: like things deeper than the THC and the
look of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have always smoked for effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I, you know, didn't like the
effect of a strain, definitely not going
[SPEAKER_05]: back, but you know, it's also,
I guess just also the framework of the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry right now makes it almost
impossible to like, even go that extra
[SPEAKER_05]: mile when, you know, you don't know if
there's the market for it or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not even a question that's being
asked right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, that's why things like this are
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's awesome that you're out there
spreading the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's totally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that going back to the roots of
why we're all here at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the way it makes us feel and all
these other things are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of superficial, but they're
all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the way it tastes and the way all
these things should go secondary to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this for, you know,
but also it's social.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want something to taste good or
something that tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just going to be a constantly
evolving thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, people are getting more
and more into learning and educating
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves on product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's going to come with
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's, you know, something that
as someone who's been consuming for a
[SPEAKER_05]: while seems like, you know, a no brainer
and like, I just want to smoke some weed
[SPEAKER_05]: that tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess it's not, you know,
I have to put myself in that mindset of
[SPEAKER_05]: the new customer who hasn't ever been
exposed to this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When most people have never smoked the
quality of stuff that you get to smoke on
[SPEAKER_00]: a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have to remind myself of that
all the time, because it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have access to really amazing tasting
and stuff that makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people have never experienced
that once in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they did, it would change their
minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it did for me, it would change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I smoked in the nineties,
I smoked cat piss and that completely
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that wasn't candy gas,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was skunky ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like all the way down to the
roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was skunky ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changed me forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sour diesel came along and the
OGs that were like that and the Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Master Kush that we went through
all these things that were just absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and then humbled outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your favorite strength?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of all time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely would say the blueberry
muffin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been really, really liking our orange
cream pop this year too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like the popsicle that has the ice
cream in the middle?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an orange pop?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, you know, it's a citrusy,
like super creamy kind of different
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been used to it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's probably right now my
favorite too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Subcool had like an orange creamsicle,
but I don't know what it was called,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it tasted like orange creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember smoking flour and I can't
remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was Sunny Chi with Shane from TGA or
who it was, but they had the cherry cola
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they had the orange creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like crazy to smoke these things
side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cherry cola tasted like cherry cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the orange creamsicle totally
tasted just like an orange creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is incredible how much
diversity there is in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of blows my mind still.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe that it's actually just
naturally bud sometimes with some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: new candy ones and all the crazy exotic
stuff like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you're like eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, blueberry muffins right up there
with that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, yeah, there's some of these,
it's like so close to like food or so
[SPEAKER_00]: close to like, you know, these different
things that we smell in nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: pine, like OG is really like really good
OG is super piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like fresh pine needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a mind fuck sometimes
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more diversity in cannabis than
any other crop in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like that definitely blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe it because there is just,
you know, there's so much out there and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's, you know, even new like totally
different combinations that I'm still
[SPEAKER_05]: smell to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wow, that's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we had that many types of
artichokes, you know, it's crazy or any
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing you find in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's nothing like that with
tomatoes or, you know, we have heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 15 or 20 that are commercially
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is, you know, that is kind of the
freaky thing about, you know, large scale
[SPEAKER_05]: agricultural crops is, you know,
a lot of them get monopolized and turned
[SPEAKER_05]: into, you know, two, three, four options.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably going to be from
Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_05]: If something like that were to happen in
the cannabis industry, I would,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, would change everything and it
would not be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's too many people
fighting that honestly, if people try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, people would go back to the black
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the easiest way for them to get
people doing the black market thing again,
[SPEAKER_00]: going from where we're at now is to try to
take what we have away from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think at the end of the
day, it's like, it's also something that
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to have a background in,
like in education and be passionate about,
[SPEAKER_05]: like back to like, you know, you're going
to fail and it's going to take a while to
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grow your perfect plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I don't think that some
crazy like Monsanto scientists could just
[SPEAKER_05]: take up the world of breeding and make the
next best strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know how they don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they're not, you know, they're not
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is, is there are
passionate people that they could hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only problem is there's people
that I wouldn't call them sellouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people would call them sellouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think eventually we're probably
going to sell our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's just part of the model is
eventually, you know, I think that it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what, but we want to
collaborate and work with people and build
[SPEAKER_00]: this business up to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, working with Monsanto, that doesn't
excite me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like working with Philip Morris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's about as exciting as
Philip Morris for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people that will sell their
souls.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't be the first time, but for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there is also a lot of people in
the industry that, you know, are way too
[SPEAKER_05]: loyal to the plant and people to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll just fight to the death.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, the cannabis industry,
there's a lot of hard headed people that
[SPEAKER_00]: won't take no for an answer and they're
going to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, got all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's how you get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many generations, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like now we're on second and third
and fourth generation people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like their grandparents did
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so soon it's going to be their
grandparents' grandparents.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of a way of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's how I grew up with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's amazing to see people passing it
down to the next generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every year it's at least getting a
little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more normalized every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little like the people who are
against it like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are like, well, it's not so
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally, we're over 50% approval
for cannabis in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I was going to say,
is it's getting a little easier for the
[SPEAKER_05]: average family to like even be involved in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, it's great to like
actually be able to have that opportunity,
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of advice for
other females that are looking to come
[SPEAKER_00]: into the industry, what would that one
piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just be to not get discouraged
and to know that there's always space for
[SPEAKER_05]: you in the industry and you belong here
just as much as anybody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see more ladies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ladies that are in the industry
today, I have so much respect for every
[SPEAKER_05]: single one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like more and more and more we're
getting women in and women CEOs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and there's basically there's
plenty of room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who wants to do it that's stubborn
enough to do it and make it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're not rock stars
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, we're farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I absolutely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think women belong in the industry for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot different than it was 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it definitely is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel like, you know,
there's still some like stigmas around
[SPEAKER_05]: women and like their involvement.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, at this point, I think it's
a widely accepted thing that like women
[SPEAKER_05]: have the natural touch for cultivation
and, you know, a special connection with
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of women grow some of the best
weed out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are trying to find more out
about you and Humboldt Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: where would they go?
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go to our website, first of all,
which is just the Humboldt Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our Instagram is the Humboldt
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, there's a lot of fake ones on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch out for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have verification and it's still
bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah, well, and we're like
super shadow banned on our head account.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you search it, it's like five
fake accounts first and then it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that and then our YouTube channel is
like something that we frequently post a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of educational content on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anyone wants to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some good content on there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

future.
