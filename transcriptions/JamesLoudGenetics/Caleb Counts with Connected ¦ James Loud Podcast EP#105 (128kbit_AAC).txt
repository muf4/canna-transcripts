Let's go!
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, our special guest is Caleb from
Connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're one of the guests that you're on
the hit list of the original list that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made of people that I wanted to interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been going down and checking the
people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad I finally made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity came up and I said,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone had I haven't quite frankly,
I haven't paid like a ton of attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just listened to like my one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked around and everyone's like,
yeah, that's that's the biggest probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not one of the biggest, the biggest in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've we've worked really hard and I feel
like it's it's happened organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really I was on the Future
Cannabis Project and did the James Loud
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did 43 episodes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I was going to build a studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done over 100 episodes now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much bigger than myself and it
takes good guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, it's all the
quality of the podcast totally relates to
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality of your guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to hit the mark with a little
bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't go for just one style of
guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a fun ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can tell by the hats over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a pretty varied guest list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you're mixing it up
pretty well, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think podcasts run the risk of,
you know, kind of going down one channel
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting stuck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of run out of things and
you replay guests or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's spreading it out amongst the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got vendors, seed guys, flower guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Luke Skarmazzo on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did 14 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like redundancies for some things,
but it's like you can be you can have too
[SPEAKER_01]: much redundancy with podcast guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of that the cannabis
industry is now as opposed to 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, you can be an expert in your field,
whether that's breeding or whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation or extract, you don't have to
do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in the day, we kind of had to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it feels like I mean,
as it feels like the walls are closing in
[SPEAKER_00]: not on us, but like on the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're finding ourselves kind of having
feeling like we have to do more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least bring the people closer and
closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I wish that was more, at least,
you know, for us, I wish that's been more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the case where you don't have to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distribution is a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, it was like doing something
you never wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run it, run a crew of trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have like 26 trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I get that totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would agree, but I feel like you can
hire somebody to run the trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to run that, like run that
department.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have departments before it was
like we had electricians and carpenters
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these things like individually
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I, I'm totally under the,
I love the umbrella model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the collaboration model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think any more, you have to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to work with other like-minded
people if you want to be successful and
[SPEAKER_01]: you need some of that vertical
integration, you might not have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fully vertically integrated, but you
definitely need, I mean, I think genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do that in house, if you grow
good cannabis, you can do pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's the ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you don't grow well enough,
you might as well have somebody else doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're just going to grow mids,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even matter anyway,
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what I've noticed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that question comes up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why, like why is your genetic program
better or different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that it's necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that we're doing anything unique
genetics and pheno hunting is not crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's the whole thing, the whole
chain of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, the deciding what to cross with,
then doing the pheno hunt, making the
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably the biggest component of
it is getting it to market and finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where a lot of people,
you know, it kind of goes back to having
[SPEAKER_00]: to do everything yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people continue to try to
do everything themselves and they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: name it or, you know, they want to design
the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've fallen victim to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've had to let go of more and more
to give it more chance of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I like in my narrow vision,
especially as I've gotten older,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, doesn't always hit and,
and being able to pass that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I've seen, you know,
I've seen a lot of genetics that were
[SPEAKER_00]: really good and worth, you know,
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, even though we have the vast
majority of what we grow commercially,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like 90% of it is something that
we developed in house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that other 10% is stuff we've either
got from some friend or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: or so sourced off of clone menus,
just random, like weird names,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we've brought it in and
like, holy shit, this is yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, high T it's like hitting all the
marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never even heard of this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably something relabeled and it's
something else someone made and didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't able to, to take it to the big
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so much good stuff too,
that is just not been in the right hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato 41, I think you're kind of
synonymous with Gelato 41 to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I wish I could take credit for
creating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they created it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cookie fam guys created it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, but we were the first ones to
grow it commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Gelato 41 still to this day is
one of the best parents to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've bred with it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the, and the funny thing is,
is like, you look at Gelato 33,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at any of the other Gelatos,
and there's a lot of instability with the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Gelato 41, it just, it basically
translates to the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it out in a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you use it as a, as a parent,
especially as a donor, you can cross it
[SPEAKER_01]: with stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be going to get a
pretty consistent expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Gelato 33, like the S1s,
for example, of Gelato 33, you'll get 25
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenotypes that are very
different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Gelato 41, you're getting only a
handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it translates to strength,
structure, all the, it checks a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and as, as the perfect parent,
I consider that to mean that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: dominating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a very strong presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clear that it's part of it,
but it also like, when I think about
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelenade, when people ask us all the time,
when we crossed it with the lemon tree and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just the perfect pairing of the two
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks much more like Gelato,
but smells like Gelenade and the flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: or smells like the, the lemon tree,
but with the hint of the, the Gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: backend, it's, it just really,
it doesn't overpower anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it never seeds, you know, its
presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you always, it's very clear that it's
part of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked that when we're
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love when you can take two parents
and then improve upon them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I see this happening more
and more as where guys make a cross and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not better than either one of the
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like that, that has a lot to do
with phenohunting, but also stuff on paper
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes sounds a lot better than the
reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Skittles times Gelato 41,
it's, it's amazing, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work that goes into finding good
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some people don't have the
infrastructure set up to be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale hunts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you got to go through a lot
of plants sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you don't, but sometimes you
really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the right number?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's different on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I just popped a bunch, I popped a
bunch of drips that I made, which is a Z
[SPEAKER_01]: runs and grape gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 of them, I guys wanted to keep out of
40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, so sometimes you get lucky
and it's like, and out of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we, we narrowed it down to five that are
really special, but I think still a home
[SPEAKER_00]: run five out of 40 is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's one out of a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the one percentile because I think
a lot of guys, they, they go through 20 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 and they're missing something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be missing the winner,
you know, but another way I look at it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a, is a whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're popping stuff, you're going
to find winners in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you were to pop 10 of this,
you know, you might not find anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: that 10, but the next 10, you might find
something good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really, I like to keep it around 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 50 is a good number.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred is ideal, but it's based on your
infrastructure and your setup too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, I think 50 is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're constantly going through 60
lights of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we do that multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in a perfect world, it's about a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we have to catch, cast such a wide
net for, to keep that genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that fresh genetic launch
calendar rolling in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we've launched our third
brand smoke and promises, we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have the, I mean, we do, I think we do
five a year and one of them, I think we go
[SPEAKER_00]: big and we do three, you know,
three, 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the majority of our hunts are between
30 and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's produced a lot of good results,
but I oftentimes find myself, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, where you do a cross that,
you know, there's just no doubt in my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that it should and will produce something
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just wasted, you know,
three months because you did a 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a 30 and you didn't get anything out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you find yourself trying to nudge
something into the winning spot when it
[SPEAKER_00]: really doesn't deserve to be on the stage,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I get attached to like this cross
being so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden we're looking at
the finished material and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: so sometimes we have to run stuff twice
too, where it's like, okay, well we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow at that good this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to really focus on these because I
know there's something in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you hit it and sometimes you
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been able to detach myself and
you have to call a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a, that's a sign of a good
breeder too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who's able to just get rid of it
and make that decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to pull myself out of a lot of that
process, like because I have the hardest
[SPEAKER_00]: time letting things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, you know, want to see the best in
everyone, including the phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, but this, I can tell it can be
someone, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to just remove myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we have a pretty
comprehensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've incorporated a number of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a pretty, a good system, a scoring
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't meet the scoring,
I mean, I could pull rank and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, this one, this is gonna, I don't care
that people didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give it another shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to not do it very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've, we've, we're in a pretty good
system that prevents me from keeping too
[SPEAKER_00]: much and, or putting things forward that
really shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys do analytics as well with
everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we test everything for turps and and
teach in cannabinoids and document
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen some of your lists
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like really extensive
spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's daunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even, you know, they're like,
Oh, reference, you know, line 1300.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, I'm not looking at
spreadsheets that go that in that in
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a great R and D department.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a PhD out of Cornell running the R
and D and he comes from a data background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think he was working in
tomatoes before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just, he was just like collecting
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so now he collects the data,
organizes his data and then helps present
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a, in a way that we can absorb it
and then give feedback and make quick
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been instrumental.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowed us to go way wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it was just me and Ted,
you know, just knocking our heads on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, we'd probably still just be doing
large, you know, larger 50 to a hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hunts, keep it a little bit more
simple and less data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's smoke it and see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, but you can't smoke
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I would love to be able to
smoke everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 60 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no way you're going to do it,
but I can tell a lot of times what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke and what's not going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't always translate,
but most of the time, at least we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good idea of stuff based on the nose,
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, that has not or at least me,
that has not rung true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've you know, I was I mean, I came from
brokering week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I came up in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured it out because I realized we had
to like that was an area that was
[SPEAKER_00]: underserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people weren't doing a great
job when I when I decided to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I just look in the bag,
smell it, looks, is this going to sell and
[SPEAKER_00]: at what price is how my entire mind
worked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm still, you know, burdened by
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cannot I haven't been able to adjust
my lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm I find myself picking on like
this smell and smell and looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell and looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have what we refer to as the
sensory panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's like these taste makers all
throughout the state that we make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they get drops of of all the different
stages of the of the breeding and testing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that I'm wrong more like what
they're saying translates like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: picking phenos that aren't as good
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the the noses are a little bit
more nuanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so I can after they kind of
explain why they made a certain selection
[SPEAKER_00]: on the nose, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the, you know, the looks that
they're choosing are not they're not like
[SPEAKER_00]: the best bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they are doing what you're
referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've just they've just been trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up with cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the ugliest weed on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effect, the smell, the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was amazing, but it was ugly
when we used to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like little bracks in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it was just shreds in a bag
and we pay 60 dollars for an eighth of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up like liking ugly weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that really kind of has taken away
to where, OK, how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it taste and how does it make you
feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend died last year for 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went back to breeding for effect,
like really, because that was kind of out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a chef by trade as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, OK, let's go for flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the terpiest, most unique flavor
that I can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get some green tea ice cream,
I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he passed and, you know, he was
questioning me the week before he passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really was kind of like talking about
breeding for effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gifted me his seed collection,
which the money from the seeds that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to sell are going back to his kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on 420, we're actually starting to
launch those seeds on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was all about breeding for effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his stuff tasted good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're fena hunting through some of
this stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good flavor, good effect, but really
trying to get that focus back on feel good
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to feel up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to feel down?
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that as part of the equation
instead of it just like, does it taste
[SPEAKER_01]: good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the whole effect thing is just a
daunting way to approach things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes back to like what my tastes
and my experiences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going through it right now with my
wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I married her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just moved here from Costa Rica like
three and a half years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just, you know, she up until the
day we met was still just smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was, she never paid attention to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though Costa Rica actually has a
pretty good indoors, a lot of old school
[SPEAKER_00]: NorCal surfers down there that have set up
grow ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have some pretty good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going through it and we're
trying to find out like she didn't believe
[SPEAKER_00]: she thought it was just bullshit,
you know, that that weed had different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she claimed she never, I think it
just, she was never paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or she was smoking always in the,
in the similar mood or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as she started to go through some of
the stuff that I'm bringing home and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually she's an amazing joint and blunt
roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she sees everything and started to pay
attention to the names and started to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that Biscotti and Biscotti in
particular, but the gelato heavy Finos
[SPEAKER_00]: give her what I would describe as,
as like what, what a typical satire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, upbeat, like a little bit
of anxiety, you know, opposite of what
[SPEAKER_00]: most people get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfolding right before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes I'm always like,
ah, you know, it's, it's hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complex plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we've definitely noticed
is, you know, you, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're experiencing and what we communicate
that we, or we think you will experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that tends to be what most people are
seeing, but then you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: outliers where they're getting the exact
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, well, tastes isn't,
these things are not, they are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like with wine or any sort of
food, but then with the effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: it adds a whole nother dimension to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, because our body
chemistries are so uniquely different from
[SPEAKER_01]: one person to the next, you can have
different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Thorn Rose, I think is a good
example where across the board,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people get that same feeling from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't classify it as a, you know,
narcotic or sedative or stimulating,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just makes you feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those things I could smoke
in the morning, evening, afternoon,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can do that with sour diesel too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go back to sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way it makes me feel,
especially sungrown sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked on a bunch of it for the last few
months and it just makes me feel really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we just connect with
different genetics, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a good sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a bunch of bullshit that's
come through in the recent months that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, nah, this is like some watered
down cross of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep trying to get cuts through our
program and nothing is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've refused to smoke any of it because
I can just tell, I don't want to ruin that
[SPEAKER_00]: memory because that memory is still there,
but it's fading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still be there because I smoke so
much of this stuff trying to get the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: back because we had it, I had to go back
to my aunt and uncle, get it six times
[SPEAKER_01]: where I lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally they got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'd been several years in this
guy, Dave, I've told this story in my
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast a bunch, but this guy,
Dave from Budge Olaro came up at Reagan,
[SPEAKER_01]: the river last year was like, tell me what
you think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the real deal sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ended up getting a pound to smoke
and I've been smoking off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I still have a little bit left.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, yeah, I'll get you some of it,
but it's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is like, I thought maybe
my memory was lying to me about how good
[SPEAKER_01]: it was or how, you know, that all this
stuff is maybe these are just versions of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is like, when you
remember it, uh, like I did, cause I had
[SPEAKER_01]: it so for so long and I enjoyed it so much
when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it again, it's like,
it's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a point where we only had
one sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't all these different sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one sour and it was like,
it had, it was fuely, but it was also
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was like a little bit of a lemon
component to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, but it was very unique in its
own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter who grew it, it was always
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I think some of the genetics probably
have drifted, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Through, uh, potential pathogen
contamination, hoplite and Veroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or systemic bacteria, if it's stuff
like that, where I think it could have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe some people even have the
right cut, but they just can't get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: express properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dave's had the same cut forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his express is exactly how I
remembered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those ones that,
you know, is clearly on the comeback,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a lot of people breeding with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to see anything that I haven't
seen a lot, but the stuff I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't, I haven't gotten super excited
yet, but I am excited for the comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for comebacks in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the green, what do you think about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: All this purple weed in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's time for the green to
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We embarked on what we referred to as
Sativa revival, like five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we started a breeding project and it
wasn't just specifically green,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean, most Sativas, you know,
tend to lean green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that led us down this path of all
this old school stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it nasty and, you know,
yeah, I remember this was never good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my preference, you know,
some of these hazes and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's led us down a path and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, dude, just cause something,
the funniest thing about purple weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: once I learned, which I, and I learned it
pretty early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I learned that purple meant nothing
to quality, it, it was in my head,
[SPEAKER_00]: except I could not stop my own preference
in term, because it's so visually
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you look at a really well done
purple bud, it's got that nice gradient,
[SPEAKER_00]: not solid purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like it when they're solid purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it when it's like what I would say,
like 70, 30 or 80, 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a nice hue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think Jelena, it has a really nice,
when done really well as a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: blend of green, but to this day,
you know, visually, I still prefer purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I know it means nothing to
quality, but in terms of what I prefer to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke right now, it is green weed all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's J1 any, a lot of stuff from the
Jack Herrera, you know, whole family area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a lot of good Jacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people don't understand is
that in California, people hate Jack
[SPEAKER_01]: Herrera and I gotta say Herrera like
terror.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they, you know, but it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like in California, I think it's the
least like strain maybe in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the streets, blue dream is disliked,
but on the, in rec people love blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dream is the number one selling
strain in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love blue dream too.
[SPEAKER_01]: In its own right, blue dream is extremely
as a grower and someone who used to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved growing blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel good as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crushed, I crushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my friends thought I was such a
good grower when I was growing blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, when it first came around
and everyone's like, dude, like thought I
[SPEAKER_01]: was the best grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it had to do with the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: My OG didn't, you know, it was OG and it
was good, but I struggled with OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have good harvest and bad harvest and
every single harvest didn't check the
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But blue dream is like every single one of
them was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it was a little more sticky
or a little bit, you know, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: brighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, when I used to grow it,
it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, so I love bringing back old
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that the green stuff's coming back
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, we've been through every OG
that we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally launched one that we thought
was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really pleased with what we're putting
now, but it's still not that, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that original, that memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think blem's unruly OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do a fantastic job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wondering that I saw that nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, is that really OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the Florida Crippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually showed Fletcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was hanging out with at an event
Fletcher was sitting at the table showed
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he thought it was like the Hawaiian
skunk dog or the Maui skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got it as the Crippie and it's
definitely got the nose burning gas and it
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely is strong, but this washes and
it grows like a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, you know, it stacks pretty
well, but it has really thin leaves and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just don't see gas like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I missed the sour diesel,
but I do see some pretty good OG from time
[SPEAKER_00]: to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, unruly is pretty,
or blem's unruly is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the nose on it, sometimes there are
structures a little, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds are a little kind of weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they look like something might be
wrong with the plant, but the smell and
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect are, and the, and the flavor
are what I pretty close to what I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian from vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brings down some every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some frigging phenomenal OG and I
don't share it with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you know, it's good is when I
like keep it to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get some batches of the dirt skittles
that's growing soil, growing skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just keep that mostly for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll get small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it a couple of friends and then I
just make sure to pile it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just really enjoy certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And skittles is one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still love smoking skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke everything, but you know,
skittles I'd go back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think candy's going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's going away anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's too easy for people to
smoke candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people that aren't even
connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, they taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like, Oh, tastes like
something familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love the taste of good green weed
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I miss that part of it the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd say the J one and,
and we just recently brought it back and
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing some breeding with it,
but it's probably the, in my top three
[SPEAKER_00]: strains of all time, but also for sure,
my top, my top green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it just makes me feel happy,
you know, and that at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, I'm older now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm got a lot of responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got three kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm busy and I need something that can
give me like, I need something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: additive on top of all the other shit,
you know, where even if I think I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: day on the couch or a day just chilling by
the pool, and something comes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a lot of the green strains are
that for me right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we've done so much with,
with the Sativas the tropical Z we did,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a Tom Hill Hayes by GDP that
cross then crossed by Zeno.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just real light and fun and
flavorful and like no stress, no anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: and no nap time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't need more than one breather.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really enjoying that, like that,
that place right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that most purple weed doesn't,
doesn't afford me that I can't smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: anything purple on a Sunday morning,
you know, before I embark on whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing as a family that day,
unless I can convince them it's movie day
[SPEAKER_00]: all day, you know, it's rainy day outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got ZDP coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: ZDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: ZDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly what you think when you hear
ZDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like exact, cause it leans heavy on
the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it has a candy finish to it,
but it's very much like nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm bringing back some nostalgic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got a dream candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're calling it, that's the working name
of it right now is dream candy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but someone else has the name dream candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to call it loud dream candy,
but it's, it's a double LCG, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: Runtz S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put that with the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is with blue dream,
that's another breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very stable in the sense that
there's only like four phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_01]: really expresses an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put that with something like
lemon cherry, and you're going to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: stable expressions in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get the real blue
dream with a little bit of candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we, we, we found three
that we really liked that lean towards
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, but I really liked the
old school with the just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: hint of candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I want to hear more about the ZDP
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have you grown it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could something yield lower than Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yes, you can cross it with GDV.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cross it with GDV and you're going
to get a low yield and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a slow veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's everything that growers
hate, but everything that smokers love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this one's where it's trending
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find that pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really might wash better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll wash better than Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause Skittles is washing like one and a
half to 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it, and I love, I love rosin too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still, I do more of the rosin in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll do dabs in the morning before I
go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't dab throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it makes me super tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I do one good one in the morning,
before I go to the gym, I'm not smelling
[SPEAKER_01]: like Juan over at UFC gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, you know, he comes in reeking
of his joints, you know, and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, I'm high, but I just,
I, I take the nice little dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, the reason I haven't gotten too much
into, into dabbing is, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: call me lazy, call me whatever,
but I just don't like keeping the rig all
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I've done it and it's like,
it gets all gross and I'm just not into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But someone recently gifted me the,
the puff code, like the, the pen looking
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where you flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing has been fantastic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a focus V1 for you today too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're competitors, but I like both
brands for their own things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam is a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do events, but I'll give you some
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I recently got heavy into
understanding rosin for breeding purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I just, I don't want to be an
expert in making it, but I really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different microns, which ones to
combine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also when I'm breeding,
what are we really breeding for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of heads are we breeding for all
these different things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took a deep dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with SF Kana and so they've been
working on some rosin projects with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of their stuff and we're, we're going to
be producing some washers and I felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to educate myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started smoking a lot more rosin,
also hash holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings back to like, I like cash holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really brings back to like that
umbrella model where you have to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different product skews anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just settle on flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm like, okay, well I'm not doing the
cultivating, but with my cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, I want to be able to bring
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to bring joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to bring hand rolls and pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's economical rosin,
hash holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think hash holes is a no brainer and
people love hash holes for the Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it's not the most economical way
to smoke rosin cause it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a half gram in there and it takes me
a while to smoke a half gram of rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can smoke a joint with a half gram
of rosin in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you know, and the funny thing
is, so I want to be able to roll them
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want to teach people how to,
my guys had a roll them so I can QC
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted to learn how to roll hash
holes properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a huge learning curve to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say I have tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not rolled them very well,
very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually done them in blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I really enjoy blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like blunts is probably my preferred
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it started to wear on the throat
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and because of the volume where
we're asked to smoke on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_00]: because of our breeding program,
the joints are a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't roll like, yeah, like these,
like these, these beautiful, I can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had my wife take a class from,
from one of the front, from one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hand rollers up in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Christian from Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he, he taught her and I was just like,
cause he rolls some of our stuff for some
[SPEAKER_00]: of our events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm like, Hey, can you just sit
with her and, and teach her?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause she likes doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's good, really good with their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so she does them when she's,
when she's feeling up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just like, I've sort of backed away
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'll let you do these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of other shit I got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like, yeah, it's one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pretty big learning curve to all
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but joints is, it's the best way for
phenohunting to actually test your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if you want to put the even
playing feet out there, you can't just
[SPEAKER_01]: give people a bag of weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to give them realize that that
was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then people take it and put it,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you smoking bong ribs with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, if you give them a joint,
you're going to give them the same size
[SPEAKER_01]: joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to burn pretty much the same,
depending on how they're dragging it,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, but like they're going to get a
similar experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if somebody's taking a bong hit or
someone's rolling their own pin or joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like, cause I feel like
there's the perfect, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the 10 millimeter organic tips right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm pretty stuck on with the
elements paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like a tight grind so that you get,
you know, it's like, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: ones where it checks the box too,
where you get that nice white ash and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ash has a lot to do with how you roll it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just how you, I mean,
flushing, of course, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think flushing super important these
days, but also how you roll it,
[SPEAKER_01]: how tight it is, all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the grind on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to roll a blunt,
you want a really like a coarse grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you want to roll a joint like
that and you want it to burn perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to find grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Ted was really beating his
drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, we got to, we got to focus on
the white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to focus on it to the R and D
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, nah, we're not sure we're
bought in that this is actually a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they did a deep dive, you know,
interviewing people taught, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went so far, we bought a smoke machine
because we couldn't smoke and we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made one, this smoke machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it pulses and it couldn't smoke,
I think six or seven joints at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it like, it has a hood on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it pulses and everyone laughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I want to, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who said they will do it,
can't keep up with the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: They end up quitting or they can't give
notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't keep up with the program
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that just to be able to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the ash of stuff to, to do it at
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're looking at outliers of white
ash, you know, assuming that it's rolled
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that whole process, they realized
it has to do with the role, the grind,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture percentage, the paper that
you're using, how the thing was lit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what, what, what did you use
torch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you use lighter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and there's all these things come to
find out also that you can do to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: really beautiful Instagram video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's things you can
specifically do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the white ash looking a specific
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hit it with the torch afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see all kinds of stuff and I
don't, I mean, I've been smoking weed for
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 years and we didn't really talk about
ash very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, black ash, it was kind of weird
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought black ash was good,
but I didn't see cigarette white ash or
[SPEAKER_01]: cigar white ash until maybe four or five
years ago at the earliest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like a thing where it's like,
Oh, this is a box that has to be checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a hundred percent sold on all
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do understand that it's another one of
those things, especially if it's flushed
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talk, he's talking about how it
drips and you know, the oil ring on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sure that's great, but not
everything has the same oil ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's definitely specific to
different genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I've been taking deep dives
in all these directions to making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: we're ahead of the curve with all this
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I feel like that stuff's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, so we got the smoke machine and then
they figured out all the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured, you know, they homogenize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything that we were rolling,
we figured out the way that most people
[SPEAKER_00]: were considered, you know, it's in a joint
like that, the certain grind, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measure the ash color to see
if there's genetic outliers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were collecting the ash and then
putting them in this thing that measures
[SPEAKER_00]: different tones of white all the way up to
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually able to assign an
exact objective score using, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this, this, this scale of,
of whitest white versus blackest black and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys notice a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: In what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: In quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with the white ash, if it's whiter
ash, does it translate into a better
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product as far as flavor or?
[SPEAKER_00]: So flavor is the priority and not always
when it tastes really good, does it burn
[SPEAKER_00]: the whitest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never when it burns really white,
does it taste bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, the white ash only helps it,
but it is not a, a, a mandatory qualifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to burn crazy white to,
to meet, to check all the other boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do all sorts of blind trials and
you know, so we've been able to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: like white ash is a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an, it's additive, but something can
pass without having the whitest of ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge genetic component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like RSA, it's 11 as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the reasons it's bred with
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just burns white, like crazy white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then, but the other thing we've
noticed is flower structure plays a big
[SPEAKER_00]: role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four flowering facilities,
three in California and then one in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're, we started noticing that was,
there was, you know, the flower from two
[SPEAKER_00]: of the facilities was, was burning whiter
than the others just consistently time and
[SPEAKER_00]: time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were really trying to,
cause we're using same SOPs, same
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started noticing minor differences in
the flower structure and the brach size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed that the smaller the brach,
the more the brachs there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the smaller they were, the better it
burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our, our, our flagship facility in,
in, in Northern California in Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has always put out like the best
stuff, doesn't have the whitest burning
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but the flower structure is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed also gets more purple at that
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually our oldest of the modern
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some things that are a little
different at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets more purple than the other
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also heard people say like the darker
the wheat, like when it's really purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all just exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we try to not come to any hard and
fast conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of folks in the industry,
like just come down hard and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, this is because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is like, there's very few
scientists in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not to knock any of the work
anyone's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've all come a long way with very
little against all, against a lot of odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one of the most important
things is we all remain, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: open-minded that there's going to be in
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a combination that
comes along that is counter to what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: believed and preached and taught for
sometimes decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like blurples, the purple LEDs,
they were so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an example of just one of the
many things that I've seen over the years
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm like, I'm never using LEDs
because these blurples, it's good though,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got that, that nose burning, you know,
it's nostalgic from the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen so many things over the
years where I'm like, auto flowers suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I breed auto flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been breeding for the last seven
years about, yeah, about seven years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said auto flowers suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never going to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use LEDs now under canopies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I guess under canopies originally,
Tim was Bobby bags worked with you and was
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys were doing under canopies at your
facility a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ian injustice, who's our head of
cultivation and R and D he came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Drisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drisco's background in controlled plant
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget what the term is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not controlled plant, but something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like went to school for growing plants
indoors long story short and controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, agricultural agriculture,
CA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to school for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done a ton of work on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a lot of work with Drisco's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did proprietary, created a proprietary
technique for growing blueberries in pots
[SPEAKER_00]: like no one had ever done.
[SPEAKER_00]: before I said it couldn't be said it
couldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did it increased yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got a really interesting
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in his first few weeks, he's looking
at the plant, you know, one of our purple
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like top two thirds is purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom third is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not this is not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this shouldn't look like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had some LEDs from a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were G LEDs that he had from a
project from from sidelighting on
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry plants, because I guess they
grow blackberries really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so they they had experimented with
sidelighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it wasn't worth the, you know,
the output that additional output in
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just had him in his garage and he
brought him in, figured, rigged him up and
[SPEAKER_00]: put him under our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first round was like 25 percent yield
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's like, oh, the numbers,
they were like looking back at the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have as good as data collection
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, is this real?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kept running them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was more purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the buds at the bottom,
some of the buds closest to the light were
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best buds where that shit
would have made it into trim or into
[SPEAKER_00]: preroles, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just gotten rid of, you know,
they can strip that canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I believed in stripping the
undercarriage until I met until I met Tim
[SPEAKER_01]: until he gave us some favins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a believer, not only just a
believer, but I think through trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: we test everything here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're R&D facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always OK, well, let's use a
control and then test this against the
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And light lifts is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I like light lifts because you
can basically tune your lights down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not running them as hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're basically not using as much
electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring them right down to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the lights we're using,
it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then combined with the favins,
now we're saving a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think Tim or Bobby bags,
he was working for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have no interest in being in
the light business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard enough doing what we're trying
to do and across multiple states.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and Kevin are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're stoked for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Kevin go way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Kevin's such a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, that whole hydroponics
world was so weird for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, you didn't even,
you know, you kind of like had to have,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the weirdest thing where you walk
into a retail store and you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: trust with them, like a certain level so
you could talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk openly.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like some of the stores, you couldn't
build that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really had to like the guy and
trust the guy and like start talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, let's stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would really choose who I'd work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, I don't expect you to talk
like that in the first few transactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but dude, I've been coming here for six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can we have an open conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one in the store right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin was just fucking, he was just,
and I forget his partner, but Kevin had a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner that ended up getting locked up
and doing some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we first dealt with his partner and
that was like the coolest dude I had ever
[SPEAKER_00]: dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was such an OG, but he went away for
like four years on some federal charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that dude was so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I got to meet Kevin because that
guy went away and Kevin had been running
[SPEAKER_00]: something else and then came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Kevin was just is, you know,
we don't really deal with hydro stores
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like a lot of direct to supplier
type relationships, but he is,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the go of the hydro stores in
Sacramento for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OGs that are still around is like,
it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That industry has completely changed too,
you know, with cultivation facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: coming online, because originally they
were dealing with people that had garages,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe eight, 10 lights at the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it turned into 50 lights and then
50 lights turned into a thousand lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole infrastructure changed
and then, you know, your, and then prices
[SPEAKER_00]: plummeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like trying to competing with
the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then though, and then the suppliers
are coming direct to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started marketing direct to us or not
even marketing, just straight up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cold calling, like, Hey,
like there's no, you know, buy in bulk,
[SPEAKER_00]: buy our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ian had all these contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so, so anyways, we worked with GE over
the years and GE was not interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, they don't pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they're a pain in the ass to deal
with, you know, and we're not interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Ian, because of who he was and the
language he could speak, they were willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we worked with GE over the years and
we're on iteration five that they since
[SPEAKER_00]: sold the, that component of their company
to some other, some other lighting company
[SPEAKER_00]: who we have no relationship with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're looking at all the under
canopies that have come up since,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to see which ones we want
to move to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, he, it was him and at the
late, you know, who he was that allowed us
[SPEAKER_00]: to create that relationship with GE at the
time and go through different iterations,
[SPEAKER_00]: different diodes, you know, spacing and,
and spectrums and then created that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they've been great for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been, I mean, it's the most
recent, I mean, I don't know what's come
[SPEAKER_00]: to the hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess like, the, the whole Aroya,
like the monitoring that's probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though that's been around for,
I think a long time, it's, it's now,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have that, it's like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, environmental control,
like crop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think aside from that, I think the,
you know, the under canopy lighting was
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest revolution to happen to indoor
cannabis farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in recent years, I mean,
before those two, it was what double ended
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs and yeah, which was like 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy that certain names of products
bring on a nostalgic feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's just thinking about that
time and that excitement level,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're gonna make so much more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you did, but it was also hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this whole learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, we used to run ducted
hoods and now we're running, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bear bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to re readjust all our calcs
on, on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people that were moving forward from
a long time ago, they didn't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't calculate that correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people still don't
have enough dehu, you know, and that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ian came in and we, we introduced,
you know, we did small trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yield increase was a percentage of
the room or percentage of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we did whole rooms,
it was like the whole thing broke and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like, okay, when you all of a sudden
increase yield by between 20 and 30%,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a whole lot of transpiration that
wasn't happening before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all your calcs are gone out the
window and you gotta, luckily we had extra
[SPEAKER_00]: power, but a lot of people just,
you know, their rooms, every, they put in
[SPEAKER_00]: every light they could with their power
service and an extra, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 705 or whatever the, the, the dehus are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, there's no room for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta cut lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't want to cut lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sacrifice quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they deal with botrytis and they deal
with PM and other issues like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just, they're in the cycle
of death, you know, and they, they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one wants to, the owner doesn't
want to hear, you know, that they got to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut lights out and it doesn't believe the
grower doesn't think the growers doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: good job or whatever the system is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just, they just circle down the
drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's like, once you get botrytis or
some of these fungal pathogens in your air
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, it's like, then you almost have
to completely replace your air systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can scrub to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a lot, there's ways you
can treat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, if your drying room has a
botrytis circulating in it, it's going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have problems and it's
going to be on the surface of the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different, but like,
it won't affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a couple of weeks after you
put it in the bag, you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a little bit of that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, on, on the topic of, of
pathogens, you know, we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does because it's also not harmful at
the, you know, at just any, just the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of it isn't necessarily harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in this room right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee it on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I heard it's in your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in baby food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's fucking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a non, it's a tech detector,
non-detect test in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, which is just ridiculous in,
in Arizona, we, you have the option on
[SPEAKER_00]: your testing to choose for, I think it's
the presence of aspergillus or the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of the micro or myotoxin or
whatever that it creates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which it rarely turns into.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had, we're like at 0.01% fail rate
over the years in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're at like, you know, five,
6% in California, same weed, same yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: same everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has gotten sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's reported anything in,
in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other States, it's total yeast and
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are at different levels,
but it's arguably a much better
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause total yeast and mold can be a bunch
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even pretend to know if that's
relevant, but what I do know what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with in California is not,
it's not practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are we dealing with it,
like we don't think that we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: outsized amount of aspergillus fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have become the target of, of battling
between labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working with one lab and then we
pulled our business because they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us, you know, their results started
to vary significantly from where they
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, this doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either something's wrong in your protocol
or we don't know what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't work for our business
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to another lab and we told them
the reason why, well, they worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: some other labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are also kind of on that end of the
stick where they, they're holding up some
[SPEAKER_00]: high and mighty posture of their,
you know, they're doing things one way and
[SPEAKER_00]: these other labs aren't doing the right
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all on this, this war path,
attacking the other labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst, you know, cause there are
haters out there and they're just looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to come after you and looking to come
after me and everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's so crazy that you can
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is of course there was
going to be variants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is your testing,
like if you have a five pound bin and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're taking a random sample out of
there, you don't know if that was from the
[SPEAKER_01]: top, the bottom, where it was,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you homogenized a bunch of it,
which would give you a better result,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to be a hundred percent
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so they turned us in and then it
resulted in the DCC going and pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff off shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're pulling stuff off shelves
that's been in market for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it sucks that unfortunately our
product sometimes sits in market for three
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what is the environment that
that store, what's the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: their storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like did their AC go out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did, you know, did it, was it during rainy
season and they had, I mean, it shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you never know what conditions are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, and not to mention it
passed DCC, it passed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: COA and it's in market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now they're going on a, a witch hunt
and they're just, they're coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pulling samples and then they come
back and pull samples from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: batches again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting recalls right now from
samples that were pulled in January and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just issuing a recall right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you're truly after the
health and wellness of the consumer base,
[SPEAKER_00]: why did it take you three months to,
from the time you pulled the sample to the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you, what is your testing protocol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your testing protocol?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, they were given 15 million in
the budget to build a lab six years,
[SPEAKER_00]: no lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no DCC lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which lab they're testing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they testing with one of our
competitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they, you know, meaning one of the
competing labs, it's a competitor,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't tell you their protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't tell you who they're testing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, no, we will give you zero
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull a hundred thousand dollars of product
off the shelf this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull 200 off the shelf next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're up to a million dollars of embargoed
product and zero transparency into what is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have initiated every possible effort
across our supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, you know, we're looking at every
single product that's out there short of
[SPEAKER_00]: microwaving the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, the aspergillus is fucking,
I know it's like, that's what Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: and these other countries are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this weed and it's just fucking
zapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a fucking frozen dinner that
you let defrost in the, in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of cryocured weed
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just putting that on the table guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the, I mean, I think it has its
purpose made for extraction, but I hate
[SPEAKER_01]: astronaut ice cream weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, it's one of those things,
but I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see this farm to table model that I
would love to, to be able to execute
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a lot of companies doing their
best and I don't know what the solution
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I realize distributors need
refrigerated trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have a temperature controlled
environment where they're storing it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to how Laguna has their beer
across the United States and across the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes refrigerated until the time the
consumer gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be ideal, but it's
like, how do we solve this problem to
[SPEAKER_01]: where a consumer goes in for the first
time and they hear all about connected,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they go buy it and they're not
satisfied with the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not because it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because it's six months old,
you know, and I don't know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, I mean, it's for multiple reasons,
but you know, for to have good sales,
[SPEAKER_00]: good and accurate sales and demand
forecasting data, we're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: these retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start at the retail level,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there shouldn't be six month old
product on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, we need visibility into the
retailer's inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in every other CPG product that is out
there, it's in the, it's in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: interest of the retailer to give the,
the, the supplier insight into what is on
[SPEAKER_00]: their shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we don't want six month old product
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how much money I got to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that didn't sell, we want that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to replace it with fresh,
but the, unfortunately the retail network
[SPEAKER_00]: is, it's this hodgepodge of people that
have, you know, some of these guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: including myself, we've been in business
for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started on a shoestring budget and then
we, you know, we've developed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, you've developed, but now
we've got to, you know, we've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: further develop and you got to open
yourselves up to, to some of this data and
[SPEAKER_00]: then allow the, the provider to get
insight into what's on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's, that's a product quality
issue first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it goes in, you know,
and it plays into some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: topics that we're talking about
Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these retailers are super
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, as if they give up some of
their data that it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving up some secret, it's just like,
but it's what's best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we have data into what's on your
shelf, we'll come, we'll swap it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can backfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, if you sold out of something
fast, we should, you should want us to
[SPEAKER_00]: backfill it and put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if it's empty, if that, if the spot
for Biscotti is empty on your shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause you sold it so fast, you're losing
revenue, we're losing revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll get back in and backfill it
or take off the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: More data is better for the entire
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of like people like
holding stuff real close to their chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to change the, the California
retail, the entire supply chain in
[SPEAKER_00]: California needs to mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to overhaul, I think for sure
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, the retailers play a big
role in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the regulatory level, I mean,
I just like, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, they don't know what to
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't seem to be interested in,
in, you know, communicating with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like they see us as their
opponent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we, we've, we struggled to
have like a really solid voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: unified voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people, this industry
historically, particularly in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggled to find a unified voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of egos.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't seem to get along and people
can't seem to, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all have a lot of things we'd like
solved, but like, we should narrow them
[SPEAKER_00]: down to like three and tackle those three
as a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get to the other 15,
some point or maybe never.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we tackle the biggest things
together, at least we're making an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it feels like a lot of
everyone's just like on their own Island
[SPEAKER_00]: and willing to stay that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cat Elliot at catalysts,
he, he started a trade group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started as a retail trade association,
but it's already expanded into brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, he's got some
really, he's got some of the biggest names
[SPEAKER_00]: in the retail space and some really solid
brands were members of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that has a good opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got, you know, a pretty good legal
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also understands the regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not afraid to, you know, shake a
stick at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to unify, we've got to create a
voice to try to get some of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what is best, you know,
for at the end of the day, if you solve
[SPEAKER_00]: what's best for the consumer, you know,
you probably solve a lot of things and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not all about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This consumer is pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people have been smoking
weed from a lot of bad sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of bad shit on it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that that time's done,
but let's not over right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over-regulated out of fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's react.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reactionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most regulated agriculture
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In existence, there's nothing that's
regulated like cannabis to that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's definitely over-regulated and,
you know, it's, it's sad to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think all these things will get
worked out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully at least that's the hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like how, how many good brands
or how many good companies, how many good
[SPEAKER_00]: products will fail to continue to see the
light of day or, you know, in that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like, like, I'm not a big
conspiracy theorist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you could put on your
foil hat and be like, if there was to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger play to really consolidate this
industry down to, you know, whoever can,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's ever really got the biggest wallet
and who can stand here the longest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it feels like this would be a
pretty good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they're going about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like that's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the hemp thing,
you know, which is like, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's honestly laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really like what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, look at Texas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's changing in Texas,
but yeah, it's well, they're trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some people think it's not going to go
because there's so much money behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all of us in the cannabis space
have tried so long and put so much blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat and tears and so much money into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're just watching this thing
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and a lot of us are playing a
role in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, I don't fall on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm like, I'm gonna get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you can get your money,
you get your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm never going to, I don't want to
hate, I don't hate on anyone in the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hating on the regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, make up your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just want, I just want to know
what's what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's, if I need to go play in
that space to appreciate what full blown
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization looks like fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like then I'm going to go do that and I'll
keep this, you know, this propped up over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problem is that she keeps moving the
needle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second you jump over there,
they're like, no, no, that's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're stuck back over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they allow it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just such an unstable
market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to tell which direction
someone who is a hard worker and wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: invest their money properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost impossible to guess what's
next right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so once again, it like goes back
to the wallet and the pair of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, nuts you've got, it's like how
big and how crazy are you willing to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and how are you going to push it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And time and time again, it's those folks
that seem to like, I've just always taken
[SPEAKER_00]: the stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, you know, cause I fucked
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do everything illegal and I had
all those sleepless nights and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: every van was potentially the end of my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every van parked on my street ever
was potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always thought that there could be
someone, someone in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't miss those days at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but then it's like, it feels like
it's going back to, it's not quite like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it's like, you gotta be willing
to just take all these crazy risks and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just put yourself out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, weed is being shipped
internationally right now on a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about the legal
shipments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is happening, you know,
outside the legal network that is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the legal network is, is fucking mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is they could be making
tax money off this so much, so much money
[SPEAKER_01]: in international.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's all these international
markets and we, we produced the best
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, is we could be exporting
to Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is we're not allowed to
export it and it just sucks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks for a lot of us that I think
would be benefiting from it, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's disheartening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's, it was either today
or yesterday, there was a new article or a
[SPEAKER_00]: new, you know, mention says White House
does not see rescheduling as a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, once again,
you go back to the tin foil hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, are we being given like a,
about as clear message as we'll ever get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is not the path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this will not race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone that survives this race
is going to be very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm, I'm in it for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in it for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anywhere else to go for one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to that realization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere else to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the life I've chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sounds like you are, you're not
going to go back to the kitchen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're going to bring this into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, everything I do circles back
to genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything we do, we are going to do a
cooking show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love, I love being able to cook on
that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I had to cook every day,
I'm a workaholic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I cook, I want to, if I own a
restaurant, I'm going to work there 16
[SPEAKER_01]: hours a day, seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, that's not the life I want to
live, but I love cooking for my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: and I love being able to provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is like with cannabis and
all these things, I provide an experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can provide an experience for people,
that's what I love more than anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially for my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like that's what life's all
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you break it all down, life's about
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those are the things you can't really
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can buy a vacation, but it's
those experiences you have on those
[SPEAKER_01]: vacations that make it memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've had some amazing
experiences with friends and I've cooked
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of, a lot of people and had
great experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've had great experiences from
it too, but I get personal satisfaction
[SPEAKER_01]: from providing the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so doing a cooking show, that's,
that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how will we'd be incorporated into
the cooking show?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is, is the weed going to be in the
food or is it just kind of a company?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I don't put weed in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not, you know, I can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I enjoy rosin gummies from time to time
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the 10 milligrams and I bite a
little piece off them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not, I'm not really serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I am the biggest lightweight
when it comes to edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me some mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll eat, I'll eat the shit out of some
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to edibles, I go light,
but the thing is, is I smoke a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I enjoy, so what we're doing in my show
was I was just going to cook for my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course my partner, he's like,
okay, so how do we bring this back to
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to do Omakase style and
we're going to do like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: five to seven courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with each course, you're either going
to get a dab or you're going to smoke a
[SPEAKER_01]: joint, or you're going to try one of these
new devices that people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be with our genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pair the food with the different
courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all bite-sized stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got Cubone who's snooped dog's
personal chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to come on as my sous chef
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can have, you know,
five or six people in there and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike them all up and have good
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I like being able to set
people up with other people to where we
[SPEAKER_01]: have great conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, if you get a diverse
enough crowd, you can talk about some
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I refuse to use the word foodie,
but I'm a foodaholic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never cooked professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cook, you know, almost every single
night in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single morning I make my kids
their breakfast every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cook for the family every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cooking for my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I've gotten busier over the
years, I've found it harder to do like the
[SPEAKER_00]: more complex, longer, you know,
longer time, you know, cooks or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people try to do like the
weed thing and they want to incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: the weed into the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's a restaurant in
Sacramento, Michelin star localis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they did this really cool dinner
for us once and they put weed in the food
[SPEAKER_00]: and no one's ever done it as good as they
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I was so fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became unenjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had the they had the the infused
option and the non infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was like, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: She will not touch any weed, edible any.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I want the non infused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow some of the stuff got into it
and she was like scared high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like weed in food is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just the way it reacts, because
everyone's body chemistry is so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not used to it, it'll give
you that paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoking does not give me paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can smoke the strongest sativas and
maybe I might get a little paranoia for
[SPEAKER_01]: about a minute or five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that goes away really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas edibles, it just like doesn't go
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want it to be over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like a bad trip because it
doesn't end.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I've I've eaten edibles where
I'm like high for eight hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wake up the next day and you have
a weed hangover, which is absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got friends that eat a thousand
milligrams like it's nothing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they can't hang with the smoking,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of them, there's the way they
absorb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's really cool that
you're you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can link up again on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you down here for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we want to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've I've been doing a little bit more
content stuff and we did like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: steak thing and I I'm big on steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we talked earlier
before the show that I'm eating a lot of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of red meat and it's all encompassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we grow some of the most amazing
products and this is it gets better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better looking and tasting as we get as we
hone our craft and tying it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love smoking when I'm cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the nice things about having a
great hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're a good cook and cook a
lot of steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a great hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you got the joint right there and
it just takes it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only place I'm allowed to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, because the house joints smoke
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make your house smell bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that one piece of advice be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remained relatively restrained,
like when people are just throwing up more
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and, you know, you know,
now that being said, we're in Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in the Eastern District,
the Eastern Federal District, where they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sent a number of legal cannabis
folks to prison, federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say I regret it,
but, you know, I would have definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged, you know, reinvest more of the
profits, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of profit, Luke Scarmazzo did 14
years and he owned a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not why he did prison time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, fuck the feds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually knew Luke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Luke in, I think, 2000, 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think either 99 or 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up to Chico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was real good friends with one of the
guys that I was living with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met him up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stayed at our house and he was super
cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they opened that spot and the guy
that I lived with helped him run his
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to sell him a little product
and he was just like, it was just so
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so bananas and it was in Modesto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we stayed, you know, we kept our
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not because, you know, for any other
reason other than it was just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, it was a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was like hectic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is, this seems a little,
I don't want to say I felt like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, but it was like, it was either hot
for getting jacked or like hot for
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt like that place was cracking
a little too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty unfortunate what happened to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's probably one of the worst,
you know, worst cannabis war stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and Richard DeLisi, those two stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, there's lots of bad
stories about guys that went away for
[SPEAKER_01]: something they shouldn't, they would never
have gone away today for, for one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then uncle Rick did 32 calendar years
for cannabis with circumstantial evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: on the long stint he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really sad in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's super gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were, it was close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you remember that whole Hayward,
the, the, or not, I think it was Hayward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the, what was operation Delta,
the hydro stores that got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I didn't even know those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never even been to their store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I somebody, when that happened,
the lawyers was like, Hey, do you know any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these guys read these names?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Nope, didn't know none of
them rang a bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like three, four months later,
I get a call from my HVAC contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Hey, one of the,
you know, he knew one of the guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, Hey, I got a message from the
electrician, this guy, Brian, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are, when they rated him for that
whole thing, they were like, tell us about
[SPEAKER_00]: Caleb counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about free rich health moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, what do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And turned out that electrician had done
some work at our facility through another
[SPEAKER_00]: contact who was Bay area, you know,
and we were like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lawyer is like, yeah, you're under
federal investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, if they interrogated him
during a raid, about you and listed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the names and all the companies that were
affiliated with you, you are under federal
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation and you are likely next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be out of the business in 24
hours if you don't want to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like one of the most sobering
conversations I had ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to pick up the phone and make
the call like dispensary, every gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers out of that place before close of
business and call the grows and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: every plant is cut down, pulled out of the
ground, thrown in the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out of the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in 2000 and ended to 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2012, early 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out of the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like my, my lawyer said,
he's like, you should be a ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so luckily, you know, we got that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, I still don't remember
his last name, but if Brian's listening,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's from the Bay area as an electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I owe that guy pretty much, I guess in
some ways my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause then they went and rated
my next, you know, one of my competitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a friend of mine, El Camino
wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rated him three weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my lawyer was like, you were,
they probably just went from you and
[SPEAKER_00]: realize you're out of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then went to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily he didn't go to prison,
but they took everything from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a real, he's a real successful
real estate agent now, still a real estate
[SPEAKER_00]: agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would, I'm sure he would not have
chose that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was good in the weed business and
killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changed the direction of his life
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad that somehow after all the
shit I've done, I remained unscathed until
[SPEAKER_00]: the airport incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, did you hear about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hear a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you're bringing pre-roll joints or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was traveling from California to
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just bringing them a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like, it was like a 20,
I think 20 jars of two point, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was 25 jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of 2.5 grams, just samples of our,
of our infused pre-rolls to show them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, certainly if I would have
have sold them at full retail pop,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have even recuperated the cost
of my ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely wasn't trafficking in
sales, which is what I got charged with.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possession with intent to sell started as
a misdemeanor and they upgraded it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: felony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just write a ticket right then
and there and say, you know, the cop even
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he started, he was a real
aggressive at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he started to realize this is
kind of, this is a little much,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he started to like make
excuses kind of, which was weird,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and they're like, I feel like
they have to justify what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like they're kind of feeling bad
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ended up being on the tram
because I missed my flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the tram back that Sacramento
airport and we ended up being the only,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the only ones on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, in the future,
just check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you check this stuff,
we'll never catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, the guy that just busted me is
giving me advice on how to further traffic
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in his words, traffic marijuana
and, and not get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was surreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they, when my lawyer went to go
to court, he was like, you're not on the
[SPEAKER_00]: docket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the case number again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dude, they upgraded you to a
felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just would not negotiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, they were getting a
conviction no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, we got you dead to rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want this possession with intent to
distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, we'll give you interstate drug
trafficking if you'd like, cause you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just had an experience at SFO,
SFO of all places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was actually going international and
I had a little bit of my personal and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going through security and literally
I was going there to film Mila for her
[SPEAKER_01]: 80th birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had a little bit of my personal
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go through and I'm fine through
security going through the scan my ticket
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm walking through the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy's like, how much cash do you
have on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like 400 bucks and maybe some euros,
like 60 bucks in euros or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you smell like weed,
how much weed do you have on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, a little bit of personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, okay, let's take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start taking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, that's a little bit of
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of rosin in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's like, well, where's the
flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, you'd put it on the
counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't even realize it was in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so I'm like, so my flight's
about to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I good to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I got to talk to my
supervisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you've got to be kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I missed my flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take me in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: To where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were you flying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they probably are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, I mean, I don't know if
I was profiled or whatever, but basically
[SPEAKER_01]: they went in the back and they searched my
stuff and that's all I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had declared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, they asked me, I told them
I had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They let me go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically had, oh, the funny thing is,
they took four tests on the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was harvested early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three, it didn't test for Delta
9.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't pop dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth one is like slightly changed
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they took a picture with that one and
they confiscated it and let me on my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were actually pretty polite about
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I learned a lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed my flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to fly 24 hours later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a bunch of people got in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had trouble flying over there with
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I have a hard time flying
anywhere with not knowing what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treat it like medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a doctor's recommendation still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of those people that still gets
doctor's recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially after that incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure to keep mine to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: And totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, I think of it as medicine
and I feel like we should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can travel with anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can travel with any sort of pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why can't we travel with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really has to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just had an incident in Cabo's
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they profiled me for sure
because I pressed the button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, nope, you come right over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched them profiling people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're profiling mostly people of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the only one that wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I noticed everyone else they pulled
over was someone of color, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they searched my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, tell us where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have CBD, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they like went in my,
I have like, you know, a little pill
[SPEAKER_00]: container that has like a bunch of mixed,
you know, just random onesie twosies of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that I, they're in my backup in case
I forgot, you know, my vitamins or my
[SPEAKER_00]: medication or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like the random shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was three, uh, the heavy
hitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're my favorite, uh, sleep,
uh, the heavy hitters, CBNs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have five, I think they have five or
10 milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're like, you know,
what's this, what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it has no, it's just a pressed pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're like, ah, ah,
and that was like the admission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they went deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they pulled my wife aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they went through her shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, tell us where the weed at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought out a test machine and
they're breaking up the pill and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then they, uh, and it wasn't
popping, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they called over another guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this guy looked much more
studious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like had a different machine and he
just tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were testing a bunch of other pills
that I had because I have all these,
[SPEAKER_00]: I take supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy was like, you could tell he
was annoyed at the other guy who was like
[SPEAKER_00]: all gun ho like thought he had a bust on
his hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy was like, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, wait a minute, you know,
to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the CBD that acknowledged was see,
they're like, no, it's a, he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a vitamin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no CHC, which is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fucking bizarre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild for something we believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so firmly believe in that,
you know, I feel like it makes the world a
[SPEAKER_01]: better place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's people out there that are
like, no, people should still be going to
[SPEAKER_01]: jail for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, those people are going to die
off very soon, you know, in the near
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the younger generation is
starting to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think the vast majority of
people that are still putting people in
[SPEAKER_00]: jail believe that we should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some weird power trip,
like upper hand, like I think behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes, most of those people are like,
I don't give a fuck about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've just, I've come in contact
with so many people who they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your find out one way,
shape or form that, you know, off camera,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, you know, not exactly off
camera, but like in the comfort of their
[SPEAKER_00]: own home and their own private circles,
they have a totally different stance of
[SPEAKER_00]: what they'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they've got, they feel like they
have to keep either like this power trip
[SPEAKER_00]: or this image thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of it is image,
you know, that they feel like they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to, for their voters or for, you know,
their peers that they have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetuating that they don't even believe
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just doing it because they
don't feel like they could acknowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were wrong or that they have a
different opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the, I think that is a
large majority of what is still the
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and the people just feel like they're
just following the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the guys at SFO that I was
dealing with, they felt like they were
[SPEAKER_01]: just following the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very respectful, but also I was
breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can break the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, unfortunately, the only way for us
to get legalization, the reason we're
[SPEAKER_01]: here, why it's legal is because we had to
do things illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had we not done that, it would still be
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt in my mind, cannabis
would still be illegal if it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_01]: the outlaws that kind of pushed it
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, I played such a
small role in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's people that, like that you
discussed earlier, that they gave their
[SPEAKER_00]: literal lives, you know, or a big chunk of
their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been so many people that
have laid it down, you know, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, it was for personal
interests, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they chose to make their story heard
and to be an example and to sort of lend
[SPEAKER_00]: their story to the rest of us to continue
charging forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is truly a war.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you stand back and think about it,
it is a war.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been many, many casualties and
there continues to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the casualties are showing up in
different ways now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just millions and millions of
dollars being flushed down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have tried to do it right and
weren't able to overcome the overly
[SPEAKER_00]: burdensome tax structure, regulatory
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it feels like they're trying to
put us out of business right now with this
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you saw recently,
they recently changed the, they recently
[SPEAKER_00]: did a major cut to the number of the
pesticides and IPM stuff that we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, already we were stricter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where almost no one knows us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already had stricter requirements than
organic certification, like by a long
[SPEAKER_00]: shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we already had significantly stricter
and they just took an ax to what we could
[SPEAKER_00]: use previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the list is even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what we're allowed to use to
prevent, you know, crop loss is ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not tied to science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tied to fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately most things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I have positive outlook on
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, we can only hope,
but you know, it's like, some things
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't looking too good and other things
are looking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way cannabis is spreading
internationally is really exciting right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's, it's bittersweet
because while it's expanded in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, it seems to have reached a limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's bumping up against that
right now, but what's happening on the
[SPEAKER_00]: international landscape and the
opportunity to do business and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries, like, you know,
having to do all these calls at weird
[SPEAKER_00]: hours or talking to people in different
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you've been doing that for
a long time, but it's like, I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: took a step back the other day cause I was
like, oh, these fucking 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: calls or, or I feel bad for them that
they're getting on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized, I'm like,
wow, how lucky are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealing with someone whose first
language is in English and we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about doing business together and they
live, you know, they're nine, eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine, 12 hours, you know, different time
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fucking crazy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking like, and genetics can
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's going to be our genetics grown
in their facility to our standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in Australia, someone in Thailand,
someone in Germany, someone in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people have been smoking our weed
in Spain and UK for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these other countries, I think very
little, you know, and that's fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something to be excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to get up out of bed for
is like, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm choking someone out on the other side
of the planet, you know, that doesn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're smoking, they're going to be
smoking my weed and like having the best
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking experience that they've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like 2010 for them, you know,
and 2010, those were magical years for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, like pre 2010 to 2018,
even those were, you know, it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: nostalgic for me, like the early high
times, cannabis cups, people were excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I love about Spantibus
going to events like Spantibus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Mary Jane this year in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to be doing some live
podcasts at the Grove booth with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Turplock guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we'll get you in on there and
it's going to be a lot of fun,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that reminds me of 2010, how it was
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were excited for what's to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already experienced it and there's a
lot of Jade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like, fuck, it was rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and they'll probably
experience that too, but I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just excited about weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, the money hasn't come in,
come and gone and come and gone because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've experienced where it's like,
we're rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing you know, they're
kicking us in the dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing you know, we're on top again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're, they're knocking us down
and cutting us off at the knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and that's just, I think that
happens with most businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just put it in a great
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just thought about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just in a phase of our, of the cycle
that we've been going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks different every time because
it feels that much stronger each time,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it, it's, we have more invested
now, more years of our life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're older than we were then,
and it feels different, but we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a cycle and it's a down
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next up cycle will be bigger than
the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we got to keep,
keep in front of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little bumps, these hurdles,
no matter how painful they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other point you made earlier,
is the people that make it through this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are going to really see the
fruits of, of what they sowed over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years and all the hard, hard shit they've
been through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, the horizon is still
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just love being in here and watching
this unfold and having guests like
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this experience for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I talk about experiences like
this experience for me is just so
[SPEAKER_01]: gratifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we have the opportunity to interview
people like yourself and all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: people in the industry and hear their
stories and like also see their story,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stories unfold and being able to get
these names out there for some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's great to be able to give people
a platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
