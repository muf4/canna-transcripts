[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the James Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, my special guest is Craig
Coffey.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, Craig?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing real good, James.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Craig and I go back at least 10 years
from high times events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying it's getting closer to 20
years, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, time just flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've worked for high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you are the perfect person for
the podcast because you are a connoisseur
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I've ever cared about my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the main thing as the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you love weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know a lot about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know a lot about flavor profiles and
getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when you asked me to come on the
podcast, I asked you what we were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was afraid you were going to say
like work or industry or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you said weed and you had me
instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what we're going to talk about,
you got the right guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're going to talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetics and how genetics have
changed, I think that's a great topic for
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least to start off with is how the
genetics have changed over the last since
[SPEAKER_00]: you started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we talk about that,
let's dive into your history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first time I smoked a joint was
probably in 1991.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within a month of that, I would say I
was a regular daily smoker, everyday wake
[SPEAKER_02]: and bake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually turned my life around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of a bad high school student.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the wake and bake got me really
interested in my first period chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: class.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of nowhere, because of weed,
I became a really good student.
[SPEAKER_02]: I graduated with a great GPA and got a
good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I credit weed entirely to mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I credit weed entirely for graduating high
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were probably around 14,
13?
[SPEAKER_00]: First time, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was born in 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good year for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem dog, that was a good year for chem
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a good year for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 was a good year.
[SPEAKER_02]: To this day, I think that it's the
pinnacle of weed was Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's gone further than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's so influential to so many
things, just like the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and chem dog is a part of the
Grateful Dead, the person and the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we talk about the Grateful Dead a
lot on my show, but I think there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of ties to the cannabis industry for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're not a deadhead and you like
weed, you should respect and love the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're an integral part of what we do
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that scene didn't exist, I don't think
we'd be even close to where we are today
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as strains and varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think Dennis Perrone said it
said it best that it's medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you believe it is or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time you smoke a joint,
it's a medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's medical benefits for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think now that we're
older, you look at, you know, we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking since we were kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's only had positive
influence on my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of a negative one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not my health.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I spent a little less money in my
lifetime on weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving me the munchies when,
you know, I don't always need to eat so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a skinny guy though, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me alive.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you in the last, you've been in
California for a while now, but you moved
[SPEAKER_00]: out from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first met at high times events,
but hung out in New York at the office,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked weed in New York when it was
totally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can smoke it on the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York is wild right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't lived there since 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back recently for the first time
since legalization and just blaze a joint
[SPEAKER_02]: right out in the public and all the places
that had ever been arrested or harassed
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was, I just went on weed tour all
around Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking in every spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times Square, Coney Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics wise, what were you smoking
out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: California herb I brought with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I went into a few shops and
honestly, like there's gotta be great weed
[SPEAKER_02]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: There always is great weed in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so many storefronts right now
that I feel like it's kind of hit and
[SPEAKER_02]: miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty hard to find great weed just
off the street, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of mediocre weed in New York
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of mediocre weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot
of stuff that looks good too, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you got to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pretendica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretendica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call it pretendica back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how's weed changed over the past,
since you started smoking, what were the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutions that you see and where it is
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I first got into weed in
Florida, you read about strains and high
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were lucky, maybe your boy had
something he said was some strain that he
[SPEAKER_02]: named or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Florida, at least at the time,
there was two types of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Crippy, which was basically
didn't have seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was everything else,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that was like a proper strain
grown outright without seeds in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties in Florida was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say in my life until about the year
2000, I only knew Crippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't know exactly what strain I
was smoking and this or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step in the evolution for me,
it was when I got into the high time scene
[SPEAKER_02]: and started working cannabis cups is
meeting guys like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people were actually doing it,
like doing breeds and seeing a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains at a cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the variety is- Oh, so much variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over in Europe, it was like this
big melting pot of people that had all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of different genetics that they were
bringing in every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with spandibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spandibus is still very much like that,
you know, where you have all these people
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in from all over and everybody,
some people, they wouldn't even talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other except for the fact that
they're passionate about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of weed too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another one of those things that
really brings us together as people.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, one of the interesting things going
on in weed, now that all these laws are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to peel back is we used to have
little islands of people developing great
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and we were completely
disconnected from each other because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the law or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Occasionally you go to a festival and meet
somebody else like you or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's like you can develop a strain
in LA that within a year is a nationwide
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worldwide strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's crazy what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all global now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's good and bad to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of made the gene pool a little
homogenous, in my opinion, more homogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: than I would like to see it, not
completely homogenous than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we fall into these traps
because that's how I describe it as a trap
[SPEAKER_00]: because of hype, because of popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get excited about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it in Europe with haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always talk about how in the 90s they
homogenized the genetics over there with
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: People got excited about haze and the
diversity went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then gelato came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cookies, sherbet, gelato,
lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have runs and all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like they're very much similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's all people demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other stuff is like,
no, I don't want any Jack Herrera or I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want any sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's changing now, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the scene over in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like because there's so many
people, we also have these groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are like, no, I want some
sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want shit that doesn't have a ceiling
where I can keep smoking and keep getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarcity breeds popularity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have a flood, like people
retire runs right now, take runs away for
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be the only thing I
think anybody wants, you know?
Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to grow GDP, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why doesn't anybody want to grow GDP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my opinion, the reason people
don't want I love GDP, but nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it because it takes about 31 days to
veg it properly to get big enough buds so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you harvest, you got chunky buds
instead of small buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't get big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small, short plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew a lot of sour diesel growers in New
York that unless they can get $500 an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce, it wasn't worth growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they could get that price at that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the same reason, it's just not a
chunker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny, though, but I think a lot
of people don't even know what sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some confusion in that strain that
started with the European diesel,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not sour diesel at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different thing altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like Soma's New York City diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the same at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's loud, but it's not gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gas by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually just talking to Soma
yesterday about that because we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: on some tissue culture stuff with the New
York City diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different than diesel,
chem dog, any of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're talking about burnt rubber,
the smell of burnt rubber as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You further complicate that strain with
the popularity of the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became like rappers are putting it in
their lyrics and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody who is trying to hustle some
weed wanted to call whatever they had sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel, in New York at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went through a summer where
everything in New York that didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds was called sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wants Blue Dream, we're calling it
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody told me once, if you love Blue
Dream, that you don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you hate Blue Dream, then you
really don't know anything about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 100% the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not the biggest fan, but I'm also
I appreciate the fact that it probably has
[SPEAKER_00]: the single best out of all the stuff out
there as far as structure, as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor, consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow nice, huge monster buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it right there, loud,
it's just maybe not the personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what people want to smoke every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But good Blue Dream is still good Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it because it reminds me of in New
York, the only access to reliable clones
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had in the early 2000s was a guy
that did strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the actual Kyle Cushman strawberry
cough is very similar to Blue Dream,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, in flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not in THC potency or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke Blue Dream and it's good Blue
Dream, it takes me back to smoking Kyle
[SPEAKER_02]: Cushman strawberry cough in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of it also is all
these flavor profiles are nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing stuff coming out now that
people are saying is original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, I was smoking that same
flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years ago, we had some similar stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Juicy Fruit from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wasn't even 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made that was a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around that time, we're seeing stuff
that's very Juicy Fruit bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like you're chewing on the gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not an original profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Schlemmens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever smoked that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Schlemmens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very Juicy Fruit, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say it, that's what comes in my
head right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love those unique flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they remind you of something very
distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like Bubba Cush has this
soapiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I smell that soapiness,
I think of Bubba Cush, but I also think of
[SPEAKER_00]: Irish Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do kind of get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really good, you know,
Bubba, I think some of the mass producers
[SPEAKER_00]: and large scale cultivators kind of fucked
the Bubba market up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But real good Bubba Cush is real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba Cush has amazing, amazing flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it burns to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You refire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say it gets you super high,
but the flavor is so good and it gets you
[SPEAKER_00]: lit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then back in the day, we had like the
Master Cush, the Bubba Cush, the OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got to get back into a trend of
more flavor profiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing that like I'm kind of
disappointed with the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is everybody's just racing
towards potency now and above 24,
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who even can tell the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have some stuff that's 14
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Sour Diesel, for example, I grew sour
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had our Sour Crosses that were
testing like 14 to 16 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will smoke any of the 30 percent
stuff that most people have today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those terpenes are just dragging the THC
across the brain barrier, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get you some serious catch lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recent debate on the word psychoactive
versus psychotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technically, CBD is psychoactive
because it passes the blood brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the definition, the difference
between the two words?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so psychotropic is the one that gives
you the effect like the high is
[SPEAKER_00]: psychotropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always used psychoactive,
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just recently I was corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love knowing little details like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about those little details in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I also pronounce stuff
incorrect a lot of times until somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: corrects me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was saying chat GTP instead of GPT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so let's let's talk about high
times for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how did that start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was working for a I came up through
college with a network engineering focus,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like pre Google, you know, like the
Internet was still an infant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I knew HTML.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew Excel and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was making a lot of really good money
doing temp jobs in Manhattan and New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was also like I would take a temp
job, find the two or three people in this
[SPEAKER_02]: office that smoke weed like I do in the
week that I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have a new client.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it all dovetailed in my life
really well at the time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I one of these temp jobs finally turned
into a job with a company that was
[SPEAKER_02]: building Ford Motor Company's internal
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was I was managing a pool of
programmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 9-11 happened and we were in
lower Manhattan, our office building.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company never reopened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all kind of scattered, but we remained
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the guys that I used to manage
got the job at high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, Jeff Weston.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're out there,
Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he got the job, everybody at the
company we work for looked at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody congratulated him.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all looked at me to figure out how
that wasn't my job because I was God's
[SPEAKER_02]: only stoner in that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was selling everybody from the owner
down to the receptionist weed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: place, you know, like.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeff killed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived at high times for about two years,
got a job as the lead programmer for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Onion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he dropped my reference and that was
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my dream job, the job I was born
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't believe it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a miracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life changing experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you're just so stoked to get a work
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stoked just to go and take the
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to walk into high times office
and talk to Michael Kennedy, owner of high
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't get the job, it was almost
enough for me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I was pretty psyched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went into the interview and Michael
Kennedy, you know, rest in peace,
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael, kind of an intimidating guy,
like a serious, serious dude, like a major
[SPEAKER_02]: player in, in counterculture history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like broke Tim Leary out of jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's a gangster at every level,
like from the professional to the street
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I go, and I was nervous as hell,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in there and he didn't even read my
resume.
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks at it and he's like coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my last name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, uh, we have a house in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our neighbors are coffees and they're good
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to do fine here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was that 12 years later,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love that job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did you do there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do the same thing the whole time
you were there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started, um, in 2005 as the director of
technology and, and director of technology
[SPEAKER_02]: at high times means that anything that
plugs into an electrical outlet is my
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility from the toaster to the
website, to the fax machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, you know, we were a 15 person
company, so that's where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a lot of coordinating too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for events then, I'm a paperwork and
organization nerd.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really like, I'm, I, I have this
work style that I call alpha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to write a book about this one
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call alpha lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot accept low level output.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to do big things, but I'm also
deeply lazy, you know, there's a conflict
[SPEAKER_02]: inside of me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I make it work for me is I go
into a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find the hardest thing that this
business is dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take it on and I do it for five or six
months and figure out ways to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in six months, my alpha lazy
techniques have got me doing the hardest
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in this company without really
putting any effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody thinks I'm a dynamo and I'm
just like maximum efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maximum efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I was able to employ alpha lazy in
a really good way in high times because
[SPEAKER_02]: they were in chaos, like organizational
chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: U S cups and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going from the minor leagues,
the big leagues, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got hired and they needed major
organizational help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my forte.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we just match made in heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them and they loved me and it
worked out great for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did big things together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: High times did big things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think some of the younger
people might not know exactly like what
[SPEAKER_00]: went down at high times, but like we
started doing cannabis cups when,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, um, changing the game, they would send
us to, to Europe to do a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no guarantee that we were
all going to end up in a European prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was no guarantee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and we knew this going in,
like that was part of what made us a
[SPEAKER_02]: special crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people did get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mila got arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like make an omelet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You break some eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when they arrested Mila that
one year and it's like an Arian bailed her
[SPEAKER_00]: out of jail, but like they arrested Mila
out of all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, she's, she was begging for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's tough as nails though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, she was asking, we got our,
our, when that happened, we had,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had just picked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do the cannabis cup at the
power zone in Amsterdam, which was like a
[SPEAKER_02]: nightclub and the power zone closed its
doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found a new venue, which was much
fancier, much nicer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, outside of the city limits of
Amsterdam also, which turned out to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the local police didn't know how to
deal with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They raided us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they marched in with an army
full of, uh, jack boots and straight like
[SPEAKER_02]: had us all down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sent us our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it turned out to be one of the
best cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mila is marching around going
from cop to cop asking how much weed am I
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 300 grams with what the answer
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 600 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, look, 301 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me to jail right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic Mila.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go to jail for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch jail though, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I stayed in hotel rooms worse than
Dutch jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yeah, so much been in the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked to him today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So someone will know which episode got,
you know, he, but he's out of jail or out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the hospital, which is similar for
someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's like smoking and they don't
like smoking in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure he doesn't like being
institutionalized in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a, when we were going to
Amsterdam, um, I would be one there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would send three of us early,
like a week early, just to start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: things together, collect money from a
couple of vendors who owes money and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone was always our first stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he would pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, he would buy a giant ass
booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would pay for all of it in cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd go there, go to someone's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to take the next day off because
if you ever gone to someone's house,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not like you can do anything
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave there with like a sack full of money
just to get everything going.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone loves smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love smoking hash, love smoking
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you like hash as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I used to be a huge dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, for maybe two years or so,
I barely smoke flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I did was dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the, since I've moved to
California, I've kind of gone back to
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's such good flower out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is so much variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, we were indoor growers in New
York forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have grown in closets,
basements, attics, you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and, uh, but I never was able to
grow full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we moved out here and I'm in Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The climate is beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys know much about
Vallejo, but it's like sunny and 75
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees about 300 days a year,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we're full sun growers now and I'm
loving every minute of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a convert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I used to think HPS was the answer
and that's not right guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full sun is the fucking answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vallejo has changed so much since the
romper room gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back in the Mac Dre and you know,
E40, you know, rapping about that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and Vallejo for better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the Bay area has changed,
but I think Vallejo especially has cleaned
[SPEAKER_00]: up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wild place, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in New York my whole life and I
thought I knew what a bad neighborhood was
[SPEAKER_02]: until I moved to Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I personally, like I thrive in a bad
neighborhood, so I kind of love it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to operate in, in a,
in a bad spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to keep your head on a swivel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't jump out of a car in a parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know, I know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awareness, but that's just about life too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being aware of your situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the bright side, you know,
all that's, we're done talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: negative shit in Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vallejo is a wonderful place to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful city with culture and
heritage and a fairy that goes to San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco and like it's, I love it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's access.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, your Benicia is right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in the potential of Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think there's so many people
moving there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the, the property value has went
up like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think I could ever buy a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was a, an apartment dweller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was a rental guy for the rest
of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we moved to Vallejo and bought our
first house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could have never happened if it wasn't for
Vallejo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got in at the right time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause now it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My house has almost doubled in value since
we bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pandemic, crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no houses available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, yeah, the, the amount of
properties available in California in
[SPEAKER_00]: general is just really difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got a nice sized backyard and I was
a little bit afraid that I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble with getting robberies or maybe
I'd piss off the neighbors if I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a New Yorker, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, you know, I don't know what
California people were like growing weed
[SPEAKER_02]: next to them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently nobody gives a shit.
Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most, most places they don't give
a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, my neighbors, like every fence that we
share a fence with, they all grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed like some of them were just
throwing seeds in the dirt and letting it
[SPEAKER_02]: do whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like 12 foot tall males out
in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I bought Jorge Cervantes grow
Bibles for Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I swear to God, this is the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to all of my neighbors with a,
with a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the ones I know that are growing weed
and I was like, you know, read this book
[SPEAKER_02]: and let me tell you, these guys were so
psyched.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have given them Danny Danko's
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have copies of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have, I would have, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like they're, they're, they're a bunch
of Chicano guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love that Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loves Jorge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have the heart to tell him he's
Canadian, bro.
That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Bay area, everyone grows
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most neighborhoods you smell it
and it's also legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal to grow in most cities,
I think in most areas in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they cannot stop you in California
from growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some counties can stop you from growing or
ask you not to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Concord is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically I can't grow outdoors in
Vallejo, but everybody in Vallejo grows
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even want to mess with that in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 34 cops, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not unless they're going to buy some weed
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high times and then the cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think that was like a big,
like a big thing that happened 12 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago when you started doing American cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it went from doing one cup a year
for, for not 20 years, but it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, Hey, let's go have a fun
party in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the high time staff attitude
towards cups to a full on business.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six a year, a hundred thousand people per
cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi-million dollar operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy billboards, marketing campaigns,
radio appearances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a hurricane and it was still
like herding cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you guys and dealing with stoners and
people that think they're, they want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that was just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, from the outside looking in,
I think a lot of people thought high times
[SPEAKER_02]: is like a hundred person corporation or
something, but we were always like 20
[SPEAKER_02]: people in a room, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, no, but it did feel like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to organize an event where you
have that many people going, it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of organization and you're going to
make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we made a ton of mistakes,
but the thing I was proud of is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we never took a step backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every cup was better than the last one the
whole time I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm very, very proud of that record.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a ton of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fucked up all the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's part of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of growing too, making
mistakes, learning from your mistakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: correcting them so that the next crop or
the next event, this is how progress
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn from our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that a lot on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a, it's a great thing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mistakes are a valuable teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having a small enough ego to recognize
that like, to get better at something,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you don't just learn how to play the
guitar, badass, just right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of time and repetition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you learn how to, you make mistakes
and you have to have a small enough ego to
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep practicing and practicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you suck, everybody sucks in the
beginning at whatever it is, whether not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think some people just get it
right out the gate and crush, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially women, women cultivators for
whatever reason, I feel like they just
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to do better right out the gate than
men do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a sexist remark or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a level of attention to detail
that the female gender is born with that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't think that we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's some, and it's so individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just generalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people, some of my friends
just right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think right out the gate,
I was the best at growing or, or even
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I made every working mistake in the
book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put Kool-Aid on my plants to make them
taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did every stupid idiot thing that you
could do as a, as a young grower.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I remember I go,
I was excited to get a couple thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds per light and now I can get 45 to
50,000 seeds per four by four.
Crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like, but that's the whole
thing, but you're excited that you got
[SPEAKER_00]: some, but not realizing what the potential
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I see the potential of
45,000, I'm like 50,000, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you've, if you've never
experienced quality at the level,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always levels to this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most people are exposed to this
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get something a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, but if you show them this,
then it's like, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how I felt like a,
I'll go back to what I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pinnacle of cannabis breeding to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's been things that are almost
as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never been anything better in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is, is it was a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was God's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't any of that, but he was smart
enough to save his cut of a very lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: seed that he popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popped a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, shout out to the whole chem
dog crew, you know, all those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg's a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had skunk VA on a while back and he's,
he's amazing guy, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike P, but all these guys, G's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, AJ and JJ, AJ's got a seed thing
coming out now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some AJ sour diesel seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to meet him and give him cash to
get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's you can't buy them online or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually have to be next to him face
to face and hand money to him.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to pick and choose who he sells
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting one because I think
JJ from Top Dog, has actually done a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good job with his back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you popped any of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have smoked some that other people have
grown to show me how good they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I struggled making, you know,
I mean, we, we did a lot of back crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: with sour diesel to try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the, what he's doing is what I
was trying to do 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually done it a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he started from a better place
than we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we started with a spicy Jack times
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you actually tried to recreate it from,
I wanted to create seeds of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: From like it's it's base elements or from
you had a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically we had the real sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our crew had the real sour diesel,
the chems, all the chem docs, chem sis,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted sour diesel seeds and I
wanted to sell sour diesel seeds so
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in the world could enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really difficult because we
crossed, it was a spicy Jack cross that my
[SPEAKER_00]: partners had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically we took that and
basically put it back on the sour and then
[SPEAKER_00]: put it back on the sour again,
take to find sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spicy Jack wasn't like Jack
Herrera that everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a funky like pungent Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it have that urinal cake tinge to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it like, not so, so some of them
did, but most of them weren't like that
[SPEAKER_00]: hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was more like funky and it went
really well with it, but it was its own
[SPEAKER_00]: unique thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't sour diesel even through the
back crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my buddy, Micah that I've
talked about on the show took that four
[SPEAKER_00]: times back and then, so we had four back
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point we didn't work on it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the 7A sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people remember the 7A
sour that we did, that Micah and I did
[SPEAKER_00]: together, but it was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was its own thing, but it wasn't sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went over to Europe and messed
with some Europeans that were like
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it with white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to cut over there doing some
white widow crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely not the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way JJ did it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a couple other people that
have done it as well, but JJ has really
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through going for that nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's very difficult,
more difficult than what most people
[SPEAKER_00]: think, because it's not always as straight
and forward as it looks like on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: On paper it looks like, oh, you do this,
this, and this, and you get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of things that can
happen in that time period where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantum mechanics of play, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have this real interesting
tie to cannabis that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes, it makes us feel whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us, not me, not everybody,
but I feel whole from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it completes me to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wouldn't be doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is where I belong in
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cannabis from, like I have a serious
ADD issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have undiagnosed ADD issue from
when I was a child that cannabis fixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the reason it's undiagnosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I never had to go further than
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it totally balances you out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it does the same thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I grew up in a weed house too.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents are basically just like I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, my dad was slinging in the
seventies and stuff, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoked weed in front of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of parents drink water in front
of their kids, you know, like it was not
[SPEAKER_02]: even a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it wasn't even like, so for me,
it's like being around cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with cannabis is normal as talking
to my mom or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would feel weird if it wasn't in my
life, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelics too, like I, you know,
I struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love psychedelics, but I struggle to
embrace them as easily as I can embrace
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's this on the same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what it is,
but like mushrooms and people are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all these micro doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, we didn't do micro
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know what that was,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even weed though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't, we got, we used to smoke
weed to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't smoke weed a couple puffs and
that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, we're finishing the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to put the joint away and
then pull it out later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that never happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were young, my brother and I had a
thing where we were always smoking in the
[SPEAKER_02]: car in Florida, you know, in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't even want to have a roach in
the ashtray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whoever had the last hit of the roach
had to eat the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was kind of like our thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of disgusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better smoke it all the way down so
there's not a big roast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys weren't using crutches
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like you're smoking,
smoking it down to the little bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's fire some of this stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we puffing on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who rolls these?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working on the Perfect Joint
for a while now with the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got professional joint roller on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He rolled these actual, these are the last
few professional joint roller.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a job like somebody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you want that job, we're
looking, we're hiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think part of what we do as JamesLad
Genetics, we want to show the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, if you're going to buy seeds or
clones from us, you'll be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the flower, to see the finished
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to wait 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the beauties of kind of what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I smoke joints like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I wanted is to be able to
share that experience with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is still probably a year out
before we have these to market in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want people to experience the same
thing I experienced when I get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they get to really get the
full flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been, you know, so like,
for example, I, you know, with the R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: process, we were doing some of these
monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a five grammer, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got a big tip, but it burns hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it burns too hot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you lose the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you still taste them and it's still
good, but it's just not as good as this
[SPEAKER_00]: shape and this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these are three point five
grams and you get the real full flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get clowned on all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I prefer a skinny joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to me, it's the equivalent of like a
low temp dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not like a nice little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it goes through and it's not hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're not killing those turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, but all these things
are like they've been researching for
[SPEAKER_00]: cigars for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the best smoking
cigars, some people like the big hot ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that burn, but the flavor profile is not
nearly as delicate on a cigar as it is on
[SPEAKER_00]: a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for those subtleties and
you want to be able to get those like
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely extreme subtleties, not even
just subtleties, but like extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: subtleties with some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you legally, and this is, I don't know
if this is even legal or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you legally sell seeded bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you were just saying, you would
like people to be able to smoke the weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: see the weed before they grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: How come nobody packages seeds just in
bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like grow out a seeded bud, put it in an
eighth, let me buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, but you wouldn't want to smoke
that bud because it's less potent for one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you at least get an idea of what
you're going to grow out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, so I mean, that basically goes
on to our model where you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get our flower and see flower samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait the 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we're going to have joints of
stuff that'll be in metric to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tissue culture, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting seeds from us,
you'll be able to see the finished
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to an event and I guarantee you,
we're not the only ones that, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: start this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the last ones to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's probably going to do
this eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes sense as a business model to
be able to show proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do QR.
[SPEAKER_00]: QR codes with stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of COAs, lots of testing
involved with everything that we do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds can be a shady business,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much shady.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy it and then you don't even know
what you got for 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, or a year or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, I read a statistic
somewhere and maybe somebody knows that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in the chat, but 75% of all seeds
that are bought retail are collected and
[SPEAKER_00]: not germinated, which I totally believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70% seems like a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a lot, but that sounds like
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at how many seeds I have
in my seed collection, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at percentage wise of stuff-
How many years do you consider a seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be viable for?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you store them correctly, you can store
them for 20 years, maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about longer, but I know that
they stay good if you control the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and you keep the humidity
really low and basically take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want fluctuations in humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has a different opinion on this,
but that 55 to 60 degrees with really low
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is you don't want a big
fluctuation in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the longer you have it in a good
environment like that, the longer it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's embryo rescue now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to keep it in that
environment and you were struggling,
[SPEAKER_00]: the embryo rescue 30 years from now is
going to be a lot better than it is today,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's embryo rescue?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embryo rescue is an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Justin, Apical Biotech,
my partner, good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does embryo rescue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like take a non-viable seed,
somehow make it viable again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that just doesn't pop,
they do it in culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically in a petri dish using
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is with embryo rescue,
it's like the game operation, it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got a pair of tweezers where they
actually crack the seed and then pop the
[SPEAKER_00]: coat off of the top and then remove the
embryo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like surgeons, they scrub?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absolutely go extremely sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a tour of RTC lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I knew about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this past season, rest in peace Milo,
Big Buddha.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, actually it was Elise McDonough,
a former coworker from High Times,
[SPEAKER_02]: had a blister pack that he gave us the
year he won his first cup of the cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to pop it and it didn't work,
but man, I really wanted that to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the cheese cuts around though,
the real cheese cut is around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Milo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost a lot of friends in the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Milo is a good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had a smile on his face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice guy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think they had that good of a
weed in England until I met Milo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He changed my whole mind about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cheese is something special,
something special on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unique flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had the cup we were talking about
earlier, when we got busted, they stashed
[SPEAKER_02]: a suitcase behind some art display that
had like $200,000 worth of seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me, my wife, Melissa, and Jen
Bernstein from High Times smuggled it out
[SPEAKER_02]: of there while the cops were there,
put it in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't know any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later that night we found him at,
where was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was Barney's Uptown or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, oh wait, wait, hang on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went and got it and brought it out to
him and he started crying, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought it was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool lost all his seeds in the fire
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace, Subcool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my piece of advice to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was at High Times is like,
if you want to win a cannabis cup and you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have any connections to a breeder or
a cut or something like that, the best
[SPEAKER_02]: place to start from ground zero is just
buy a pack of Subcool seeds online and pop
[SPEAKER_02]: them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first San Francisco cannabis cup,
somebody actually did that and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: Vortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: He called it God's Pussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Valerie Corral had to go up on stage
and give this guy an award for God's
[SPEAKER_02]: Pussy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all mortified.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had to issue a formal apology
and correction because he told us it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually Vortex and I bought a pack of
seeds from Subcool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first San Francisco cup was pretty
exceptional.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were expecting eight or 900 people and
it was more like five or 6,000 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the police helped us manage the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought the cops were coming to shut us
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were coming from New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear stories about how liberal San
Francisco is as a New Yorker, but we had
[SPEAKER_02]: no first experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have friends that I met at that
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike from Gas House.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Finnish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finnish ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and I hang out still, but we met at
that event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing crazy dabs back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rigs were completely different than
they are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to a point working the front desk
at that event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and my wife and Mary McAvoy,
who was a publisher at High Times,
[SPEAKER_02]: were sitting at the front desk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scanning every ticket of people coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were only expecting 800 people,
so we didn't think it was going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: crush that it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got a line of 4,000 people right in
front of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, at that time, if you came up to
the desk, looked me in the eyes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and said, I'm on the list, I pretended to
find your name and said, all right,
see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Know that for future events, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they don't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's crazy, that's what people
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I remember about that event,
was it the Segway?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a wedding venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys who ran it, it was a super cool
gay couple that ran a high-end wedding
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just for weddings in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Furniture district.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were down to give us our space to do
our crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were super cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They helped us in every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, though, there was the poacher,
the guy who didn't pay for a booth that
[SPEAKER_00]: was selling medical recommendations
because they wanted you to get the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations to smoke at the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dude that was in a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy had a medical booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so pissed because this dude was
making all the money because of the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just pumping out medical cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a High Times employee, we had to act
like we hated it, but we really loved that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, if the High Times Cannabis Cup felt
like the parking lot of a Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_02]: show, then we nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we were aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some shakedown street action.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all shakedown street.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower back thing, because that was
like... I mean, Girl Scout Cookies was
[SPEAKER_00]: there around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there was some entries of GSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But GSC didn't win until I won with the
cross in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Cup was also the very first time... I
wasn't competition coordinator at that
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: They finally, High Times gave me the
opportunity to judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I ever judged.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: In San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first San Francisco Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was responsible for ticketing,
but I wasn't responsible for running that
[SPEAKER_02]: contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the only ones in the whole
time I worked there that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for running.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that one off so I could judge and
get some... This was my pitch to the
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me judge so I could see from the
inside how judging works and I'll make
[SPEAKER_02]: competition better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let me do it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel lazy, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those old school judges kits were awesome
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great, but it was the first time I
ever dabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phillips RX entered... I want to say it
was Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to take an afternoon off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I ever did... We
didn't even have rigs yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had hookah coals and glass straws and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been that high in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't even know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably talk about the ways we
used to dab before dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an Atom Smasher, which was a
glass pipe that had holes on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heat up the element and push it down
on your hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a guy from British Columbia send us
a swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically like a downstem with a
titanium plate and a swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would just get the titanium red hot
and put your dabs on it and suck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they called those bells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bell that you would put the smoke on
and then you put it under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one of those and we started
bringing some dabs back to New York from
[SPEAKER_02]: these cups because you couldn't even find
dabs in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first way we did dabs was definitely
on coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd heat up a piece of coal and it'd be
like an ashtray or a cool little dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'd drop a little bit on and you'd
either have a pen cap or... I was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that before I even saw a BHO.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing that with basically RSO
before RSO was even called RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were making alcohol extracts and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were doing that back in the day
for sure too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the old school bubble house,
that's how we smoked it before there was
[SPEAKER_00]: rigs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hot knives on the stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were great for old school house,
but not real high quality bubble house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would completely ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't get the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a fader.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that product?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a little black box with a
ceramic stick and the stick got red hot
[SPEAKER_02]: instantly when you plugged it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no on off switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no dead man switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You plug it in and you do a dab that makes
you cough so hard you drop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're basically going to burn your house
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a little death trap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I burned it like 550, 600 degrees
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the rigs just got out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had rigs and they kept getting
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, they were big monstrous
rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There still are cool big monstrous rigs,
but most of us smoke out of small rigs or
[SPEAKER_00]: now these E like rigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Sparta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the Puffco, I was always 90%
on board with the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we recently got the 3D XL chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a whole different product with
that thing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as good as a high quality quartz
banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried it, but I like the Carta 2
from Focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus V.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try it out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not having to get a torch like this
and frigging hear you out in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little weird when you see people
trying to fire up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought the Puffco Peak,
I give it a double plus for convenience
[SPEAKER_02]: and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They skipped a generation of product,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were starting to make these E rigs
and then they skipped a whole generation
[SPEAKER_02]: of them and came out with their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a level beyond what anybody else
was doing, I believe personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still would prefer a perfect temperature
quartz banger to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do slow starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the cold start where it's like I put
the extract in and I just heat it up as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as necessary to get it to smoke and
then you get the most amount of turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This new 3D XL, you can not only control
the temperature very accurately,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can control the airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tweak how hot or cold your dab is
and how dense, how much resistance you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting when you pull on the... Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to do a side-by-side
on one of these shows like Puffco versus
[SPEAKER_00]: Carta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sponsored by Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like as we've gotten older and as
I've gotten older, but looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry now with what the industry has
become, we really need to be united and
[SPEAKER_00]: not like, fuck this person, fuck that
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are here, let's fucking give
props to everybody for even being here,
[SPEAKER_00]: for even being around this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a legal brand, big ups,
glad you're still doing it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about wanting to go back to
the black market and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to figure out how to do it
right with what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing these seed companies thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this stuff, but we need to unite as a
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love seeing them stop sending people to
jail for bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Above all, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one belongs in jail for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in the entire world.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one in the entire world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could fill a room full of cartons
of cigarettes and another room full of
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, you should be able to fill your
house full of as much fucking weed as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want and preserve it because weed can be
preserved for a good amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's silly to worry about any
of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many other things like homeless
that we should be worried about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The homeless situation is all fucked,
but that's all I try not to talk about too
[SPEAKER_00]: many depressing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when there's so many good
things like the cannabis cups to discuss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to a cannabis cup before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I left High Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you haven't experienced the Emerald
Cups or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Emerald Cup I go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Emerald Cup too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the vibe there.
[SPEAKER_02]: People running it are super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Blake, those guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really care about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really care about the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's part of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The passion and about maintaining the
focus on the product and not about on
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a former High Times employee,
I want to put this on the record.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people claim that our
contest may have been corrupt or scammy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a system to allow a group of
people to pick out what the best weed was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was the system perfect?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got better every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it make mistakes occasionally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there things that won that I wouldn't
have picked personally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we never put our personalities into
that decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: The system decided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: God's honest truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some incidents back in the day
where you could buy cups as a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time we found... Now you're talking
about another ball game.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Amsterdam coffee shop thing,
we allowed somebody to buy a ticket and
[SPEAKER_02]: vote and give an award.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't on you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over time, that system became so corrupted
by all these players that it became a
[SPEAKER_02]: lesser award.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we treated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real award in Amsterdam was a seed
breeder's cup, which was judged by our
[SPEAKER_02]: private group of judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be here today without it
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how impactful I think that was
for me and my career and being featured in
[SPEAKER_00]: high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's like we didn't go in
thinking we were going to win a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in there trying to put the best
weed we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, I think the first time I
entered, I lost a bunch of times too,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like I won the first time out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had this amazing extract that
we'd entered and they didn't even know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to really judge it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought for sure we're going to win,
drove up to Seattle, entered it in there
[SPEAKER_00]: with my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fucking I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I saw the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other entries were better.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we used to do also, like a guy
like you maybe entered it would enter in
[SPEAKER_02]: the California market and I would go out
of my way to try to get you to judge maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: in Seattle or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could see the sausage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you to see the inside of the
sausage as a competitor, as a guy who's
[SPEAKER_02]: putting his money into the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have probably won two cups in
Amsterdam, but I didn't enter my OG in
[SPEAKER_00]: same year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I would have entered my OG in,
I wouldn't have been able to share it with
[SPEAKER_00]: Marlon Asher and me and him are good
friends now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything kind of happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a new album coming out and he's just a
solid person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I met him at that 2012 cup at the
Milk Vag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think we met before,
but I've got him some OG and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: kept wanting all of my OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I would have entered that OG,
I probably could have won.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was happy with just winning one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like it was pretty amazing
the fact that we won it all because we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the smallest booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can attest to the fact that you guys
did a good job, especially there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we weren't the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali Connection was across from us and
they had like this 50 or 60 foot long
[SPEAKER_00]: booth by 20 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were a little 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that mattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of that mattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is like my sales guys
didn't even know what numbers your entries
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we kept it separate, two separate
worlds, intentionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we started figuring out,
so like you would come to the desk with
[SPEAKER_02]: your entry and some people would see us
write our number on the bag, the code
[SPEAKER_02]: number, and they start to remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they try to figure out who the
judges were and drop their number.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call into that early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we started doing is you would come
and I would tell you, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: your Sativa one is your entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be the number I put in the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when we broke it down for the
judges, that all got scrambled with a
[SPEAKER_02]: second set of numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your Sativa one would become Sativa 32
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody knew that I had to de-scramble
it, except for the three of us running the
[SPEAKER_02]: competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built all kinds of things into it like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like you have to, I didn't want to
lose the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best job I ever had,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, the only way I can maintain job
security, I thought, was to run a clean
[SPEAKER_02]: competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I cared about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there were some years where hype
won the cup, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hype is a powerful tool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hype is a powerful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tangi, which is so recognizable,
that's the big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was so recognizable that the
judges, it was the most popular thing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Novelty wins, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put something in a box that nobody's ever
seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's not the best thing in the
box, the judges gravitate to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was one time in LA where
there was like 10 Tangi entries,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get there where it's such a
popular cross, everybody's loving it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that 10 people enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, OG Coast was kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, you know, over the years,
things haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably five years where,
especially the Indica in the hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: category, if it wasn't like OG Gas,
you had no chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, over in Europe, the Amnesias,
people have like, everybody's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: Amnesia, Super Lemon, one of those,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about Spanibus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad was, he died in 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a world traveler.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was really, it was his main thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so mad at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He died mad at me because I've been to
Europe eight times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never left the city walls of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got to come to Spain this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2024, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, you know, I did my booth with
Greenhouse and we're probably going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a booth with Greenhouse again,
but it's an amazing experience and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, literally it's the same
people and we all go out to dinner and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out and a lot of them, it's kind of
like how Amsterdam was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one time a year I get to see a
lot of people that maybe I only get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that one time a year or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we're getting older, it's just
great seeing some of these people still
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their thing and, you know,
all over South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got friends all over South America,
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some of the stuff, some of the
magic of high times got carried on over in
[SPEAKER_00]: the span of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we did in Amsterdam was really
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought like, yeah, it was absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a game changing thing and
it was really special, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all have great memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like how I can imagine how
disco was like once it was gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was gone and I'll never be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real high times experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Amsterdam was a perfect venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we, if we, for whatever reason in
an alternate universe, did the same
[SPEAKER_02]: progression, but it was New York and not
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you would walk around New York for a
week and never bump into another cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cup judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Amsterdam was like such a,
like a perfect tiny little capsule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every time I left the hotel room,
I was like, Oh, look, there's James.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's a small enough group that
everybody kind of knows everybody too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everywhere you go, you see somebody
with a lanyard in Amsterdam during that
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then celebrating afterwards,
celebrating Thanksgiving together with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that the high times cups
were very tribal to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were a tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had our own tribe of, I gave Steve
Hager a lot of credit for that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when he like seeded the idea that was
his, he wanted this to be exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it was a ritual.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a ceremony.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever won the cup in Amsterdam,
you would get to experience the real,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the ceremonial side of it,
which was one of the most amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: profound experiences that I've ever had in
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was winning the cup and then the cup party
afterwards for the people that had won
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cup winners and nobody else
does anything really like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very ceremonial, good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those old Dutch cannabis cups
too, like the sweet brayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a piece of art by a pretty famous
artist that you can only obtain by winning
[SPEAKER_02]: a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, that's a pretty unique thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I still have mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the newer ones too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're real, the new ones that they
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US ones that were like real thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't bend like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be careful with the European
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soft, but really amazing art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me what you're up to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when the world fell apart in 2019,
I kind of pulled back from the working
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing consultations and stuff,
but honestly I've been growing weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you're fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love fishing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of stuff I love that I
just don't have time for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I live five minutes from the Cartina
straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I roll a joint in my living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put my pole in the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I warm up the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still smoking when I'm standing in the
water throwing bait man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all class striper fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Striper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's all kinds of stuff out
there too, but yeah, the stripers stripers
[SPEAKER_00]: are awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as far as work stuff goes,
when I moved here, we started the Whoopi
[SPEAKER_02]: and Maya brand and we decided to go the
manufacturing route rather than the IP
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing route.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were going to make it
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got thrown into managing a commercial
kitchen for the first time in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious experience, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big learning curve though too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know more about it than I ever thought I
would know in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've gotten really good at is
that, you know, back to the alpha lazy
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is how to take a home cooks recipe
and turn it into an SOP, a recipe
[SPEAKER_02]: calculator and something you could hand to
a contract manufacturer, start turning out
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I offer to people now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I work with people I know and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really fishing for new clients,
but like I help people bring products to
[SPEAKER_02]: market basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the whole efficiency side of
your past ties in really well to
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurants because at the end of the day,
it's all about efficiency because the more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient you are, the more money you
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that goes all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that goes with grow rooms too,
and cultivation, even seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the more efficient you are,
the more money you can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not about money, but at the same
time, you got to keep your lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to do it, you might as
well do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same mentality that you've
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've also got to develop
processes that don't burn people out,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want somebody to work with you long
term.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you know, and some people can
work really hard for a short term,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it destroys them, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what do you end up with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I mean, it's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got guys working 12 hour days or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unsustainable, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also as a business owner as opposed to
an employee, I mean, there's no work life
[SPEAKER_00]: balance for what I do really, but it's
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy what I'm doing every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm freaking blessed to have a
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been my blessing and problem in
life is whenever I get a job with
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody, I work with somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take it on as the culture of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You embody the whole experience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like each time as you go
through life, you can gain some more
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and some more experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it makes you a better person
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like better learning who
you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the big thing and learning
where you belong in the world and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences you have that you can put it
into perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were talking about data points
earlier and I believe that even data
[SPEAKER_00]: points with that, the more experiences you
have, the more data points you can collect
[SPEAKER_00]: on who you really are and who you want to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do you want to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be working 12 to 16 hour
days or do you want to work four hour days
[SPEAKER_00]: and hang out on the beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all those things are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those, whatever you want to dream of
it's possible in this day and age is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible if you make the right moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficiency is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, you're mostly smoking your
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try not to go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I do go to dispensaries, I'm really
into CBX right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys are growing some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also high times famine there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to smoke what I grow personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even though, you know, like I can
grow really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always the best weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have access to, but I enjoy smoking it
at another level than the weed that I buy
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you grow soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your preferences for substrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A perfect scenario for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a dream grow room, it's in the
Northeast in December, drawing in winter
[SPEAKER_02]: air to cool the room, growing in rockwool
with GH salts and hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're going to look at me like I'm
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you where that comes from,
little man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I grew up as a GH three-part guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I transitioned into a Lucas formula guy
with that same three-part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned about Lucas formula,
which is just like basically cutting it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grow portion of the two-part and
balancing with just the micro and the
[SPEAKER_02]: flora, lower PPMs and more often feeding,
you know, and what the end goal is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is something that's not going to play a
role in the expression of the terpenes in
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a neutral element in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my theory in starting out at
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did this for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the job at high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to try all kinds of products and I
did, you know, I love botanic hair
[SPEAKER_02]: proline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good experience with that and a
couple other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these guys, I don't really like
anymore because they all got sold to
[SPEAKER_02]: Monsanto's or whatever, but at the time,
these are the things I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to see Greg chem dogs grow,
which to me it's still to this day was the
[SPEAKER_02]: best weed I ever smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was Greg growing with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking GH3 part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucas formula, a little hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem dog I think does really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: He locked me in for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that in his room and I was like,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do it indoor and outdoor right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it outdoor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salts, more often, much lower PPM feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feed them like three or four times a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outside you prefer that over soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a very low PPM Lucas formula ratio of
the GH3 part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're adding any microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No earthworm castings in there with your
stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Teas?
[SPEAKER_02]: No tea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I disrespect any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it all, but no, not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've smoked amazing weed, grown with all
that stuff and I appreciate it and I love
[SPEAKER_02]: the guys that do that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're a real smoker too,
so I know that you're not bullshitting
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's just amazing for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My philosophy in that pursuit of what I'm
going to grow my weed with was I just want
[SPEAKER_02]: something to let the plant do the work of
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want anything that's going to
flavor the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's low road shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get great genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you get the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: JamesLadgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works better for some strains than
others too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a ton of success with things that
are big eaters, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like strawberry cough, you could dump
nitrogen on strawberry and it does fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you growing right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What flavors?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2019, a former coworker,
a lot of you guys might know him,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick Cusick, was going through some
serious health problems and we had just
[SPEAKER_02]: started an outdoor crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had bought some clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had popped some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let the males go intentionally to seed
out the females a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next season we call those Cusick's
Beard in honor of Rick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is recovering from some pretty bad
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we grew out 30 of them,
19 females, the F1 round.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept all the males, stored the pollen
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should have kept them separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept it all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You homogenized all the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the next four seasons after that,
we would lightly pollinate everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: only save the seeds from the phenol that
we're trying to isolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that we like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I'm working a free consultation
out of you right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that even make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping that eventually I would get
more and more seeds that express this
[SPEAKER_02]: phenol, but that's not really what
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to get more drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well using that same pollen, you're
basically using that same pollen and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a back cross is what you're
doing to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest, these are regulars and
it's not feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would select a new male and a new
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time through each generation,
instead of putting that pollen that has
[SPEAKER_00]: all this diversity, because each year
you're incorporating all that diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting the F1 right back as half of
it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not breeding, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people frown on it and
they talk about pollen checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should be experimenting with
pollen and making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anything wrong with
pollen checking like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this product, this project is a
pursuit of pure joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a commercial thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just doing it because we've never
done it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never had the access to a space that we
could do something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend Gordon, what he does,
he's in grass valley and he takes seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: every year and homogenizes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the true open pollination and
he's getting new stuff to throw in there
[SPEAKER_00]: every year and he's mixing all the seeds
together and he's got his own reasons for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be on the show one of these days to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's given mother nature a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most diversity possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's got their own style and
their own things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would be selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get rid of that pollen or save the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably not going to be viable
for that much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you freezing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: In a vac seal bag in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably store it in the high 40s,
maybe 45 degrees, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still viable after three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we keep getting seeds and they
keep popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just keep using the pollen
every year to see how long that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an end game here yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just been doing whatever comes
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and the feminized pollen doesn't
last nearly as long for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, we're working on some pollen
preservation techniques and using things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So question two I have for you in this
free consultation I'm getting from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had more than one phenome that I
wished I had kept a clone of.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could I have done?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once you're already in it like a
week, three or four or five a flower and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're starting to get a sense of
what, what can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can revege the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I try that and it never worked out
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone has to show you how to revege
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say reveging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose potency and all these other
things, but a lot of change the growth
[SPEAKER_02]: structure for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I did it, I get like the super
larpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a plant and you pop seeds and you
grow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's this thing called sexual
maturity that happens over a couple of
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why when you are doing your
selection process, your pheno hunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should probably grow it out multiple
times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it changes from that initial seed
run through the first generation of clones
[SPEAKER_00]: to the second generation and the third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they stabilize pretty good to
where they express the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that difference that you saw,
that could have just been from the
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it was that different and maybe
grown it out, but either way you would
[SPEAKER_00]: have probably got a different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why you want to grow them
out multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a trip like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we're doing our selection
process, we're doing that pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going now from the first clonal
generation rather than from seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it saves time for the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start getting a better picture of
what that expression is actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was much younger, we just used
to grow it out once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the winner, or this is the
winner, or that's the winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's like grow it out multiple times
to really see what the best one is and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you have one out of 20
or 100, and you're like, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way anything could be better
than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you grow it out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, no, this is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is better than that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the one you grew out that you thought
was the best isn't quite as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get stuff popping up that's good
and stuff that's not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about taking detailed notes and
also smoking your product helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cross that we have that I've been
talking about, we call it Cusick's Beard,
[SPEAKER_02]: named after Rick Cusick, big white beard
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mother was a royal highness female
clone that I bought from Dark Heart
[SPEAKER_02]: Nursery on the legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the father, I bought a 10 pack of
lemons from Source Genetics from Chris
[SPEAKER_02]: Cassius, grew them all out and
intentionally let them pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how's it smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super citrusy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the royal highness is a GG cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing special, but big,
resiny glands, a good breeding genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just mentioned GG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it gives us a great time to talk
about the High Times Cup in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they released the clones,
they did a really smart thing that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: envious of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's worth sharing with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really held genetics tight and close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't let genetics out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't like letting our stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't like sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep it in-house because we
didn't want it to blow up like how Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your most important IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse Wales, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to the Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his crew went to the Cup that they
won in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were giving out clones of Gorilla
Glue, like literally giving it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got five or six clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember how many, but I brought
them to Sonoma, my buddy Josh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all growing Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a sour diesel people,
especially because it grew similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had an awesome gas profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instantly within a season,
it changed the game, especially 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys growing sour quit growing sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they shared it and they wanted to get
it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really interesting business model
that I think people should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like sometimes sharing is the way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's not about how long you hold
it to your crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that strategy might've
really saved them in the long run too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they get nailed by Gorilla Glue
company for copyright infringements and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it had to be GG4.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whose was it even?
[SPEAKER_02]: They spread the risk out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole nother conversation about
using names that are copyrighted,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are owned by other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disney, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use any Disney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, seriously?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get some Star Wars names?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the stuff,
when it was the black market, it was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then moving into recreational where
you have businesses and a business address
[SPEAKER_00]: to send a cease and desist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still do it, but you got to
contact George Lucas and get the
[SPEAKER_02]: paperwork, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not going to do it, but you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of guys were that in
business, they wear like a badge of honor
[SPEAKER_00]: where they got a cease and desist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's cool, but it can also be
bad and slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you have something
that's super popular and then you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it whatever beer name, Disney name,
something that's already taken,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could slow you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think like even like
Skittles, those guys, they changed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think Wrigley, who's also in
cannabis, they basically went after them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't think they had to pay
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that they had to change it to
Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might get lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starbucks got some of that bong money,
didn't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard loss, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they get you, man, you don't want to
be in a courtroom across from corporate
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is like what I think a
lot of people don't understand is lawsuits
[SPEAKER_00]: cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even, even if you win, it costs time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if, you know, losing whatever,
even if you're right, you can totally
[SPEAKER_00]: spend an arm and a leg and it bankrupts
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawsuits are no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know who wins in lawsuits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked for lawyers my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time lawyers win, they're the
winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have been a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom was right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, there's, there's a need for still
new lawyers in the Bay Area, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still, even though I've lived here
getting close to 10 years, I still feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like a New Yorker visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am part of the community, but I'm still
a New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a New Yorker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still feel that you get the New Yorker
vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, in New York, you don't even
want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what makes you who you are,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially now, like New York is,
I don't know if you've been there
[SPEAKER_02]: recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like three dispensaries unlicensed
on every block.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got arrested in New York multiple times
for smoking cannabis in the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's like, you can literally smoke
weed anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could smoke a cigarette, which to me
is, it's a beautiful rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another really nice rule they made is 12
plants per person.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have three people living in the
apartment, 36 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, there's nothing that your
landlord can do about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh man, it's going to be a home
grow capital of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a company, I wish I could remember
the name of the company, because I would
[SPEAKER_02]: love to give a shout out to Ray Kwan,
the chef from Wu Tang Clan is an investor
[SPEAKER_02]: in a company that is trying to put grow
boxes in people's houses in mass that
[SPEAKER_02]: basically do everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you pay this company to let you grow
your plant count in your house for each
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a service, like having maybe a
home, like a maid or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you remember speaking of Wu Tang
Clan High Times Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've been 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wu Tang was on stage and they called Rico
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace Rico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been drinking and he basically,
he replaced old dirty bastard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should put the link and it's on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should definitely put the link on the
show, but it was an amazing performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He threw up mid performance and kept
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was Ghostface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kilo was the headliner and he pulled five,
four or five people from the audience to
[SPEAKER_02]: each do verses of the other Wu Tang Clan
members in the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rico was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like he was possessed by old dirty
bastard for about three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop the verse and then the old dirty
bastard left him through the mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He puked on the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: He literally puked on the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then later that night, man,
like we went to the whiskey bar and in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam, it's like kind of a popular
late night spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even know he was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole High Times crew was in there and
we're reminiscing about the night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like one of the greatest High Times
moments ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of sheepishly came over to us
and he was like, dude, I'm so glad you
[SPEAKER_02]: said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was embarrassed that he looked
like an asshole in front of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an amazing guy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the funniest guys I ever knew,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smokesession comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people, some comedians need a
stage and some comedians need a joint and
[SPEAKER_02]: a circle of dudes around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was definitely one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's sad all the people were losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see happening with High Times?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion on High Times now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see happening with High Times
in the next five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great name still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they tried the dispensary model
and that didn't seem like it worked out so
[SPEAKER_00]: well, at least here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anybody who works at High
Times right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no connection to any of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an observer again, like where I
started when I was 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy them every now and again,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever did the design work on the
storefronts for the High Times
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who you are, man,
but you did a really good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a cover of a magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive past it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, holy shit, that's a fucking... I
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just closed in Oakland,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really following along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went in there once too and it was kind
of like going into a High Times museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a really proud former High Times
employee moment, even though I have mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: emotions about where High Times is in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really proud of that when I went
into those shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Michael Troniak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard his name in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got Sweet Leaf Grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Leaf's the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem with that grinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you lose it, you never buy another
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have one I bought 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like both.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two grinders I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only two grinders I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet Leaf is my classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the flour mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the one where the teeth kind of
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and they have different plates that
you can use on their more expensive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get different grinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like that as a fun little
feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried that one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so are the Sweet Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the original, original grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, we were using scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was breaking up stuff with my hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through a scissors and a shot glass
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was where I graduated to.
[SPEAKER_02]: After I moved out of my parents house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fiskars scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you go as fast as you can with
the spring chopping it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, back then we were smoking
like 0.75 gram joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would suck to do a whole eighth to get
it perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I was at then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're smoking the joint and the
seed pops and shoots out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's dark, you could see them shoot
across the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are looking to get in touch
with you, they're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say you're not taking on really
clients, but how can they find you on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram or social media?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm on Facebook and stuff,
but honestly, I find my clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't go looking for him because he's
not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you make demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make unavailability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super unavailable, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the false limited marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, man, I'm a vibe worker.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not into your project, it's not
that I don't care about your project.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not into it personally at some
personal level, I don't see how I fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's a great, great way to be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think everybody's as fortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never worked in a project that I
didn't personally feel invested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that, I mean, I think Emerald Cup
is doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanavis is doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf is starting to do some cool stuff
too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of former HT guys from my era are
like reemerging in Leaf doing some cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can even call it a cup,
but like a bowl, a leaf bowl, I think they
[SPEAKER_02]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's Dougie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Dougie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitman Glass, Chalice Masters,
like he threw the Chalice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always super impressed with,
I never got to judge a Chalice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as a guy that ran competitions,
I was super impressed with what he did,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the presentation in his judges
kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of set the bar for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hit it out of the park with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an eye for detail too,
like on a different level, on a different
[SPEAKER_00]: level than I have an eye for detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when it comes to genetics,
I love my genetics and stuff, but with
[SPEAKER_00]: logos and stuff, Dougie's all over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's always had that eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my business partner also that came up
with the James Loud logo, he's got that
[SPEAKER_00]: same eye for swag master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to know what's going to be,
what's going to look good and very
[SPEAKER_00]: stylish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm not that stylish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm a genetics guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dude, I really appreciate you coming
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me out of my cave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to do this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get you and the wife next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
