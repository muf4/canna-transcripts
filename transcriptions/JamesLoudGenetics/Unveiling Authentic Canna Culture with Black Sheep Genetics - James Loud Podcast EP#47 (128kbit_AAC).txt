[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have black sheep genetics on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: James is a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am stoked on life, stoked to be back in
the Bay and it's glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super excited to have you on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking online for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been in the industry a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always preach quality and Terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mutual friend, Leo, from
aficionado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the Terp tip, we'll jump in right
away because we have another mutual
[SPEAKER_05]: friend, Organic Brian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been making a blend of organic
freeze dried fruits and sucranat of all
[SPEAKER_05]: the forms of bricks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucranat seems to be the number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's less processed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like these beautiful granulars.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sweep off the ground and it tastes
better than molasses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And old timer told me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I took a note when he said Sucranat is
the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Thies represent Dos Rios.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I built this new blend to boost
terpenes, to boost THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a side thing that came out of it that
might be bigger than both of those is it
[SPEAKER_05]: preserves the quality of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I brought some bud to show you that's
four years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's bright green.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing looking to where like
more of that needs to happen, because as
[SPEAKER_05]: we know, in the jars, it's like,
yeah, if they don't smooth it quick
[SPEAKER_05]: enough, then we're all in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a short shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the turplocks for improving shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the turplocks do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we mentioned turplocks in my
breeding book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and then I think improving the
quality of the flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, because you're
combining all these fruits and I have some
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetables in there too, and what have
you, the health of the plant and the vigor
[SPEAKER_05]: with the bricks is like so key.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, just making it be able to
repel bugs, not get mold, be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimal plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we're all looking
for optimal plant health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Leo.
[SPEAKER_05]: From aficionado and he told me,
you know, when we're taking care of our
[SPEAKER_05]: ladies, when they get sick, he gets sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: When they get cold, he gets cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: No surprise there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love being a plant myself on that
note, you know, deep connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about how you guys started
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: I first grew my first plant in India in
the Kulu Mountains when I was 12.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: And my mom and my pops kind of bailed me
out because I didn't fit in with the jocks
[SPEAKER_05]: and I didn't fit in with the preppies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was in a New England old school,
hicked out town.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my subculture of skateboarders and
delinquents kind of ran a little wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she would say to the governor or
people, if they asked how I was doing that
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't in jail or the hospital.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they kind of made an intervention and
they took me to India for a year,
[SPEAKER_05]: took me out of eighth grade to show me the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I was free in India,
I had a account at one of the local stores
[SPEAKER_05]: that had fireworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to like build multi-stage
fireworks and there was wild cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a connection with the plant
where I didn't even choose it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started a garden behind my house that I
was living at and in the center of one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: What comes up?
[SPEAKER_05]: A glorious plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's legal in India.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my mom was like, sure, you know,
rock and roll with that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I grew that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a really fun time.
[SPEAKER_05]: One time we went down to the river and we
cut all this feral cannabis and we piled
[SPEAKER_05]: it up in like a giant pile and lit it on
fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were dancing around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we were pretty innocent, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, children, weed of the corn,
you know, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was mashing and fed cows, put cows to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's cows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're like, let's feed the cows.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I got connected to it early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I kind of got my act together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to art school in Boston.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when I started working with the
Canadian Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you know, you know, before I've
heard you mentioned the green bud wave
[SPEAKER_05]: that came in and we were getting like the
Canadian ice and other strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, was it glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many good ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they called the freeze too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that stuff was moving good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Boston had the most colleges per
capita.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, you know, duffel bags at
the door and good times back in the day,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, where that city was good to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of I had made some great
friends there and and dove deeper into
[SPEAKER_05]: the, you know, cannabis life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm leaving out the most important part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after I came back from India,
I was still connected to the plant and I
[SPEAKER_05]: had cleaned my brain up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was more on point and doing OK in
school.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, no problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Parents are happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every day before homeroom,
we'd go down to an abandoned old church
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'd all fade on a blunt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And East Coast used to be Phillies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we'd smoke the Philly
before homeroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And life was glorious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I sat around with those guys and I
said, James, that I don't know what it was
[SPEAKER_05]: about her, but I knew I was going to smoke
in my entire life and that like it was I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: like I was in love with it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, to parallel that then
forward from Boston, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of got into the other side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and I moved to California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to school for computer
animation in Boston at School Museum of
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine Arts and Tufts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also did kind of graph and some
other art.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I saw what was happening out here
in California and I was going to have to
[SPEAKER_05]: get a job out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I came to take a peek and it was like
Boston was in the dirt, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: so competing against the best animation
schools around where the industry is.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I toured around California with my
dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an epic road trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: We we drove from L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: up to the Bay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at one point on the trip, we go by
Vandenberg Air Force Base.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my dad was like, oh, I did not want to
stop here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were prepared for like the whole
way up the five.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then before you hit Vandenberg,
there's like a 70 mile gap and like a 70
[SPEAKER_05]: mile gap after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole secret or the conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad was a big conspiracy guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, they fly everything in
from the ocean there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like one road in one road out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we rolled into this town kind of
uneasy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really strange with there was
all the houses, the cars were parking
[SPEAKER_05]: driveways, no lights, no people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we pull in, there's like one gas
station.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my old man's like, leave the car run.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes into the get some things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and get the gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I'm sitting there, Sheriff pulls
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he pulls up and he rolls the window
down a little bit and he just stares.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, OK, this is a little
strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then behind him comes the Homeland
Security vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: They roll down the window.
[SPEAKER_05]: They stare.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, OK, this is getting really
strange.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, I'm going to take five and
just maybe go take a bathroom break.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I go into the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been writing graph and you know,
having a good time coming up the road in
[SPEAKER_05]: this bathroom had like a word scratched in
the wall, like out of a horror movie,
[SPEAKER_05]: like a thousand times the same word.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, really sketchy now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the sheriff in the Homeland
Security.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like look at me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sheriff leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: He leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad had epic timing where he didn't see
any of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's getting coffee and snacks or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he rolls out and I was like,
yeah, you got to get out of here,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the next like set of roads down
the mile, we were looking for a brain
[SPEAKER_05]: wiper, you know, or like if they take us
in, we're not going to come out the same
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I made my way up to San Francisco,
went to the Academy Arts and I was doing
[SPEAKER_05]: the arts like before, but really doing the
herb.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And art school is kind of a farce to to,
you know, it's necessary sometimes,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes not, but it was fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, college for me was about
connections and people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still am friends with some of the
people that I met there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was out there doing that and I
started picking back up things with the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had my father, he was, we were
dealing with some family strife,
[SPEAKER_05]: thus the name black sheep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I said, dad, you know, instead of
you getting, you know, mistreated and
[SPEAKER_05]: having hard times, why don't you come out
to California with me?
[SPEAKER_05]: And originally he was all pumped up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's friends with Paul Stamets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he moved into my apartment and he
started growing mushrooms in one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: old roommate's rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was like, dad, you know,
I love the mushrooms and all, but we
[SPEAKER_05]: should really be growing some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Pops was like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm kind of good with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a few people, business on the
front.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was, you know, the master grower in
the back and the humility and the wisdom
[SPEAKER_05]: and father son relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started growing in Oakland in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were good years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were good years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there's been bad years,
but there's been, those were really good
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think instrumental years for
cannabis and cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were medical and it was a special time,
especially in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was around in Oakland 2003 and I
thought, you know, the genetics that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had, the passion, the people that were
going and shopping at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people were really passionate
about weed back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys growing the weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get that lighter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 2003, there was a handful of,
uh, places open third floor BPG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to all those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm familiar with everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The BPG go upstairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, back then you used to have that little
room upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buyers would go upstairs and we denied
people for 36.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd be like, no, we're passing on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're moving on down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you used to do the run to where it was
like, you had to work miracle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your rent was due and you go out and you
go around town and hit your spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the, you know, my dad put it most
eloquently that I've ever heard in my
[SPEAKER_05]: life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is we spend a short time with the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to think of myself as a shepherd of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we don't know where it's
going, but my dad told me the plant knows
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It knows every joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: It knows every bowl pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: It knows, you know, all the people it's
going to touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to be a part of it and help it's along
its way, you know, a booster rocket of
[SPEAKER_05]: sorts, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all just stewards at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that journey, uh,
you know, that's kind of what kicked it
[SPEAKER_05]: off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in 2012 was the fallout when
indoor, you know, vanished.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, for the most part, I remember going to
the grow stores and, uh, they told me,
[SPEAKER_05]: don't buy anything, go next door to our
used warehouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, there was more equipment in
the used warehouse than there was in the
[SPEAKER_05]: main store.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went to some people for wisdom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked with my father.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I was fortunate enough to be around
people that I wouldn't have if I wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: rolling with him that really cared about
me and took care of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I asked for wisdom from one of my
mentors, Steve Smith, uh, owned hope net,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, with his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was running that with his wife at the
time, Kathy, and, uh, his boys helped him
[SPEAKER_05]: out too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Steve, uh, mentored me and said,
well, and during this transition,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, I think it's best for you to maybe
look up to the Mendocino and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: expand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he told me, well, it's, it's a great
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started looking for real estate and
little did I know that shutting down the
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 lighter, because I was so tired,
we had three houses going and it was like
[SPEAKER_05]: forever harvest forever trims.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back, like you were saying,
back in the day when we had one house with
[SPEAKER_05]: 14 lights and everybody was happy and we
were making paper, it was less
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, more houses,
more work to where I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: at the tail end after, you know,
almost 10 years in the bay, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: burning out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a revitalization of my cannabis
spirit and the warrior marches on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the genetics in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what kind of genetics were you guys
running when you first started growing?
[SPEAKER_05]: What rhymes with 2003?
[SPEAKER_05]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I was fortunate enough to run the,
uh, hell's angels cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if you ever ran into the
flat top purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: They only had it at grassroots and
grassroots was a really great club to me
[SPEAKER_05]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and Kevin are legendary.
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to take their employees to
Hawaii, like take care of people with
[SPEAKER_05]: family, you know, and legendary legendary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also liked the Oracle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually met the guy who made Oracle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't think anybody have you,
do you know anybody that knows him?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's totally unknown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I was at one of the first farmers
markets in Mendocino and there was an old
[SPEAKER_05]: timer smoking a bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, okay, this dies
serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to hanging with him for a little
bit and chatting and he's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, you know, Oracle, I made purple
Oracle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, he says to me, uh, GDP just took
my Oracle and put big, but on it and big,
[SPEAKER_05]: but sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, we all know if you came in
with a pack of the Oracle done right
[SPEAKER_05]: versus a pack of the GDP, the Oracle was
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oracle was fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oracle was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't as big a buds though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely smaller buds,
but the turps were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had that real floral, floral turp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't have to cut the tops off on
week eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they rot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all dealt with GDP where it was the
most beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But GDP, it was the slowest vegging too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the shortest, slowest vegging
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use the dual spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The HPS with the metal halide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that veg things for me, the best is
still my, you know, I haven't gotten into
[SPEAKER_05]: the new led world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm old school in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still like HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think HPS creates a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, led creates a good product
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your opinion on seeds that are bred
under HPS and performing outperforming,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the, new leds with the old school HPS
because of maybe epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, is that a far?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people say not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people say true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just, you know, looking for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me the money, show me the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we're, we're R and D stuff
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing a lot of R and D side by side
led versus HPS also with seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know with reversals, I can tell you
reversals under HPS are significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, we're talking about far red
and stuff like that in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that adds to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do my reversals right now,
but we're also experimenting on what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to do a reversal,
not only reversal spray, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then collecting pollen
versus using live plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer using live plants when I'm
pollinating, but collecting pollen is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a way to hedge your bets for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like taking the tops off of a live
pant and putting them into a bag and then,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, getting those right before when
the bells are just about to open,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're all swollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just Zen in the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've even put on my spirit animals,
a wolf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes when I'm doing the breeding,
it's my most passionate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I put my wool suit on and I head out
and I pull out the branch out of the bag
[SPEAKER_05]: when there's no wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just open the flower rats because I'm
like you, I want that natural drift.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get a paint brush anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hair's a bit all red.
[SPEAKER_05]: Magnetism too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about magnetism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of other things that
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a pollen wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever seen that
where you take, when you're, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen's dumping on those branches and you
really want to hit the room up rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take and cut off the male flowers,
tape up several of them, like a bouquet
[SPEAKER_00]: and walk around dusting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get some good swings and it
definitely floats and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that side of the plant is
amazing to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have neighbors close by and I had
retired out of, you know, commercially
[SPEAKER_05]: growing and I just did a seed patch and I
let everything go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had multiple males and you know,
I called the ones that I might not have
[SPEAKER_05]: liked, but I left a lot and I really got
to watch them just in their natural
[SPEAKER_05]: habitat come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, I made the note as a
breeder, you know, we spend this time
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the selection, but the plants seemed
to also know where I had my early males
[SPEAKER_05]: get on my early girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, the late ones, you know,
finding their mates and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really special to me to just
let them Zen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was walking through James where I
bumped into a plant and it was like a
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen cloud.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's videos of me just surrounded
by pollen and it's sparkling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that's our fairy dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to see pollen fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've really seen pollen fly where
it's like a wall, it's almost like a cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, and then sometimes it'll just
sail over the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ever read now I got to tell you the
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked the Gouders is one of the most
legendary families in round Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikey G is a real legend in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 pound plant, 23 pound plant,
23 pound plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 feet tall by 12 feet wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was growing the pink Cadillac and I got
to see it and like this guy has been
[SPEAKER_05]: amending his whole so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a pallet of chicken shit per
hole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're mounted up all hides reworked
and reworked.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got big mounds and I saw that plant
and I was like, man, of course his name is
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, cause he's Michael Jordan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he walks up to it and he's like,
it's got three layers of netting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's, he's like, takes a huge cola and
it's probably a half pound and he bends it
[SPEAKER_05]: down all the way to the ground,
like rubs the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, look at how strong it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you and I know some strains can bend
and some will snap, but just to see that
[SPEAKER_05]: strength and that connection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had set out for a couple of years
after that being like, I'm going to grow a
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 pound plane.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, well, maybe in the future,
but I recognized, you know, I'm good at
[SPEAKER_05]: ball, but you're seeing Michael Jordan and
you know, just to be around them and to
[SPEAKER_05]: see that Zen magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your limits six plants, that can go a
long ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, 25, they used to, when I first moved
to Mendo, they were like, unless you pull
[SPEAKER_05]: 250 or just lose it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, that's, it was a daunting
task coming from indoor rooms were like 20
[SPEAKER_05]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh, I got there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was part of, uh, the, the nine one
one program in Mendocino with the 99
[SPEAKER_05]: plants, which was the, I wish we could go
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old doc hop used to give out the certs
where you'd go there and there'd be a
line.
[SPEAKER_05]: For like three hours with like 50 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he had said that you could grow 99
plants with his cert.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the sheriff busted you,
I don't think he was going to tell you
[SPEAKER_05]: that you could, but a lot of people,
including me were under that mirage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, when cannabis, there's a
constant, you know, people have to realize
[SPEAKER_05]: that that's been a, it's, it's difficult
industry to navigate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you and me finding good advice or the
right people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the most valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: People talk about terroir and yeah,
there's the ground and the air and the
[SPEAKER_05]: dirt, but don't forget about the
friendships and the farmers and like that
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we go to somebody's garden and
there's always something that shines where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're like, everybody grows different,
you know, a thousand ways to skin a cat,
[SPEAKER_05]: but, uh, you see that gold and everybody,
I pick up, you know, the little nuances
[SPEAKER_05]: and something from this garden,
something from that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes years to get good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a lot of people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want an instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you'll have good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have good weed your first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you keep doing it, no matter what
you are going to get good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything's kind of like that in
life, but definitely growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're passionate and you love it,
you are going to get to grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had hard apprentices apprenticeships
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you and I worked in a criminal
time where you wore a lot of hats in this
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're an electrician,
security man, a family man, contractor,
[SPEAKER_05]: the funny stories you tell people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried not to drift too far, or at least
you could connect somewhat to reality to
[SPEAKER_05]: be like, oh yeah, I'm HVAC guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on a double stage system
with, you know, we're silencing the
[SPEAKER_05]: motors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was key.
[SPEAKER_05]: They bubble wrap the motors back in the
day because that thing was humming at
[SPEAKER_05]: midnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would quiet it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a lot of problems to be
solved back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then without the internet,
it was all about the circle of people you
[SPEAKER_00]: knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the internet's opened it up with
information, but it's still hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: decipher what's right and what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because you'll hear on the
internet 20 different opinions on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt versus organic versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus aquaponics, you know, DWC,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all, they're all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to learn how to tweak them
and get them for you and figure out if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the path you want to go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really, you know,
interesting now that the market's
[SPEAKER_05]: expanding and we're getting into
agricultural equipment and what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about and, you know, moving things
forward in large fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically, I've been talking with
someone that grows this amazing varietal
[SPEAKER_05]: of Knaif and fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a hibiscus hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the seeds look like triangles.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're black.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like the size of a dime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it grows the stock is like 30% more
than any other stock on like in the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't have THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all these pitfalls that now we're
seeing, you know, like my buddy's in Iowa
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's one of the only four licenses and
he grows CBG and CBG helps people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even understand how much yet
cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a winner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CBG, they are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Golden.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the first time he grew it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was all paranoid because he's like,
what's up with this stuff on the plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said it was almost like a powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the CBG, I guess,
an expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-psychoactive, both THCA and CBG
non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is also non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, all these cannabinoids are
extremely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just scratching the surface on how
they can be used and how they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in with drugs and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on the drug discovery side,
I think we're going there and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stop and we're going to learn a
lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were talking, this guy's in contract
and working with some large people in oil
[SPEAKER_05]: and gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this plant is three times,
reduces the carbon footprint, three times
[SPEAKER_05]: a rainforest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of incentive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I was saying with the world
market opening up, it's like we're working
[SPEAKER_05]: with an engineer, Jason Romandi.
[SPEAKER_05]: He worked for Coke and Coca-Cola,
then Lagunitas, Boonville, Ale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I met him in a dive bar where
they have the best burgers in Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were eating lunch with my dad and me
and my dad were like, we've been waiting
[SPEAKER_05]: our whole lives to meet you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this recently or?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going back a ways to where I also
had a business called Waska.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may be familiar with or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever sip one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis infused hemp milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: 400 shops, James.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: 215.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Office in L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: and office in San Francisco on Market
Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Filled with freezers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We made it fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad invented fresh frozen
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, he is.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in my heart and he's in the sky.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the lights flicker, that's his 12th
dimensional communication.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll keep our eyes peeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Waska, the oldest edible of time is
bong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they drink in India.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still ceremony drank by the military
once a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Steve Smith had made some at Hope Net.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried brownies and everything under
the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I drank this drink, I was like,
what is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, people don't believe weed is
psychedelic, but it can be psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the same kind of experience with
Bang.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, he was kind of my
grandfather and my mentor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to him and I said, you know,
I really like your milk and I want to make
[SPEAKER_05]: something like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, as long as you make something
different, then go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, let's put hemp milk in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And instead of cow milk, all these
problems with milk and people being
[SPEAKER_05]: lactose intolerant, not to mention that my
genius idea there that I felt was putting
[SPEAKER_05]: it in with the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm like, the hemp is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The herb is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's multi-dimensional, multiverse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started making this hemp infused
chocolate milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, like you said, psychedelic,
it surely was.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stories that I hear, you know,
I served over four hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_05]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the good stories versus the bad
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you hear a lot more bad stories
than you do good stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So paranoia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, what shines for me is when,
you know, we would drink it with a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: of friends and you'd feel like you're in
high school and people would start bounce
[SPEAKER_05]: around the trampoline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Laughing nonstop, having a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the wavelength of it, we always put in
multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like into the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to fill the wheel out before it
was even the wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when I said my dad invented
fresh frozen, it was specific for like
[SPEAKER_05]: edible manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's some other people that
also were experimenting with that at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were running trim at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were at the table and the old man
didn't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he said, just stick it in the freezer
with the garbage bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, we're running through
material, making the milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, grab that bag out of the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started working with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like just like live rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a world of difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were like, we're running and we
built that up, James, to where even out in
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendocino, I had a 10K garden and we put
on Leatherman gloves and we strip the
[SPEAKER_05]: entire garden and we pack them into five
pound bricks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I seen people doing fresh frozen
manufacturing and it's painful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like having 20 trimmers come out to
your farm and sit on a table and manicure
[SPEAKER_05]: it all fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice and all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't have the money to pay for
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to see it come out of my
pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had one of the most robust
extraction techniques ever to see cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: with putting it into a boiling kettle of
milk and just letting it ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we made the milk and got things
going, it expanded.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were inspired, like you said,
by the hallucinogenic experience it
[SPEAKER_05]: offered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we came up with the name Chocowaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Inspired by Coke Capelli and Ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you said, people would have an
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to put that into perspective,
like we had a guy who was cocky at the
[SPEAKER_05]: trim table and he was like, bro,
edibles don't hit me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even sweating at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: A huge amount of ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my dad and I were like, oh,
this is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we waited and got the last
bottom of the barrel, just like in a
[SPEAKER_05]: whiskey barrel, you know, the really good
stuff back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we filled up a glass for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, you needed two ounces of
this stuff and you were floored.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he drank the glass and I'm bringing
him back to his place after it was after
[SPEAKER_05]: the trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: We made sure not to give it to him while
we're working.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right before he leaves and I'm giving
him a ride back from Oakland to San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco and he's starting to get a
little shaky.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said to him, what are you going to
do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what are you doing right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, oh, I have this date with
this girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm about to go home, just chill for a
couple of minutes, get ready, get some
[SPEAKER_05]: food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and then it starts hitting him harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's coming in heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, bro, can you get me a
drink?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're right next to a Paki.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're like, I swing and I'm in the like
parked and ready to go in like 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he opens the door slowly and he stands
up and he holds the door and just stands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he gets back in the car and he's
like, I can't go in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, all right, we'll get right
back to your crib.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're driving to his crib.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This Paki is this corner Paki store.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're on a street and he says to me,
where the hell are we right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I leave him at his house and I'm
looking at him in the rear view as I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: pulling off and he's just standing in the
middle of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he calls his roommate up from
his couch and he couldn't even talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like his roommate, but like heard
murmuring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, wait, are you in your room
right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it could hear murmuring from the
other room.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like in the living room and he's
there on the couch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, it was a three day long
trip.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like it was more powerful than any
psychedelic he had ever taken.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, all I did was sleep and eat
and like fry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, not that I want people to go
that far, but again, like you were saying
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can have the ceremonial
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a ceremonial experience at a certain
level and people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, unless you've gone there,
you wouldn't fully understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not just heightened
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your perception is heightened or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you can get full colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hallucinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say you're going to hallucinate
like LSD or like mushrooms or like some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these others, but it is psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially colors, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some wild colors and had,
you know, I mean, hallucinations out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the peripheral and like the whole world is
alive, you know, stuff like that and good
[SPEAKER_00]: and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had bad too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had bad experiences from eating too
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we said the strains in the early two
thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought of something on the way over
that I thought would be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, why don't we just tag team and go
through some of the ones I like and you
[SPEAKER_05]: like, and we'll go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give it a quick little run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem sis.
Ogre.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ayoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to flat top purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to from flat top purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go to Romulan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo perps.
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Afgu.
[SPEAKER_05]: The candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Afgu.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tallest plant ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Insane in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Afi was epic and it was so frosty.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had no idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: We flipped it at like three weeks and five
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had like maximum.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still super cropping up the top,
you know, being like, I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knock it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pushing it between the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it grows up past them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to bend them over.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we had to knock the room down,
I'll knock it down a foot, two feet and
[SPEAKER_05]: just put that knuckle in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's got finesse with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went Afgu, Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your next J?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's go Jago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jago.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that was an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's in this jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, purple Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purple Cadillac.
[SPEAKER_05]: Princess purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grew train wreck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than the, there was two cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: The arcade cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the San Francisco cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my dad and I grew train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Ty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big up Ty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tank plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad grew train wreck and we brought it
into the shop and they said, you grew it
[SPEAKER_05]: better than the people who made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I can't sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I'm taking it to LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: An epic mission to LA where I was back
when, you know, people used to put names
[SPEAKER_05]: on things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned some old club CCG,
the first one, uh, California caregivers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were down in, uh, originally they
had the, uh, Oakland by, and then they had
[SPEAKER_05]: the San Francisco on the Easter on a bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember going in there and if they
had it on the menu, blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue dot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, red dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, there was so many good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ladies love Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Domina was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember the juicy fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real little bugger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Triple X.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Doug V's.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple X OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple X OG.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug V rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's, you know, you can go
down the list of OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the Diablo, the Tahoe,
uh, the Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the true OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the peer OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I mean, the names go on and on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ortega OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ortega OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was SFV, Fino, or Acro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sonoma OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so many everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were renamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, man, it's like, that was the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving in LA for, uh, a hundred dollars an
eighth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Fairfax dispensary had six
windows, which was like legendary at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time, or six counters to sell at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a hundred dollar eight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just flying out the door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going down and working in that time was a
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why we did this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you're either meant to do
it or you, you're not meant to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like either you love it or you don't
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's people that are wearing
it for the wrong reasons too, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are passionate are still doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I still, we still love talking
about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Passionate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I've been charging this for a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's today, James, a full moon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like to crack the beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got rainwater and that on deck at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I throw them in above the stove or it
gets nice and nice little ambient heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do plates with a paper towel,
or you just do an old school shot glass or
[SPEAKER_05]: a glass guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do straight water.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do rainwater.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you do rainwater.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rainwater.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do straight rainwater.
[SPEAKER_05]: My seeds are so clean and I'm growing my
own genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have to clean off broad mites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about a dirty seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned that there's eggs on the
seeds and I'm like, scary bad,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah, running clean seeds,
running the rainwater.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, you, you know, I, I bought a lot
of inputs and me and you have been farming
[SPEAKER_05]: so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we get more and more into learning
about how to, what we need and where to
[SPEAKER_05]: get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all coming from my land.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went out and farged 200 pounds of wild
mushrooms with my kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are crushing the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw them in the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Amanita.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a golden Amanita in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the devil's cap, which this mushroom
is like this big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I went to the compost pile this
year, James, and I was like, I want to
[SPEAKER_05]: show it the most love I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, how do I make the best
compost?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like putting in things,
you know, little weeds, he said it pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: well, where I'm so grateful because I have
ideas that no one else thinks of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know why, but man,
am I grateful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, so building into the compost
and I was throwing my terps in,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm throwing the mushrooms in,
I'm throwing my mentors weed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically biodynamic, one step
above organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it all with locally processed
inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could cut the hay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have equicetum, arboretum, silica at my
disposal where I get the husks and layer
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, hay is great, but I love to
layer the silica husks and just let them
[SPEAKER_05]: break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stalks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we like to see thigh pieces.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do your piles get hot?
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I turn it over and work it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then depending on sometimes I'm like
experimenting with taking it to stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that's partially broken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've done experiments with
terpenes where I put in fresh crushed
[SPEAKER_05]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend had concord grapes and I crushed
them up like the wine guys, my feet and
[SPEAKER_05]: threw it on top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was mad fruit flies,
but it was outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, that year was kind of a
little bit of a hint, but then the next
[SPEAKER_05]: year, the plant tastes like pure grape.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, there's something to be said
to letting it just organically break down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm leaving chunks of fruit in this
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw apples in the pile and rose buds and
different fruits.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have amazing ancient orchard around my
property and on my property.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, I was just getting hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting everything that drops and huge
side-by-side loads of fruit and dumping
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So building the dirt.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, people say farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big thing that I got so like
wrecked on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what farmer means
historically?
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone who works the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought so too, until I found out
historically a farmer is a tax man and he
[SPEAKER_05]: collected taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back in the days when we're talking
about these farms, they were huge and
[SPEAKER_05]: there were workers and peasants and the
workers and the peasants work the fields
[SPEAKER_05]: and the farmer collected the taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, I'm not a farmer anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't represent myself like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, I said, what's in Eden?
[SPEAKER_05]: A garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I'm a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like saying that, you know,
gardener, steward, gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The garden of Eden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I planted fruit trees this year in
my patch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of my favorite experiences of
my life to go to the, uh, grow store
[SPEAKER_05]: where, you know, I spend a hundred bracts
and nutrients over the years and dirt and
[SPEAKER_05]: pick up trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just smiling and everybody there
was so happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I planted them for my family,
for my children, for my wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, me and you have difficult things
staying in the cannabis with our families
[SPEAKER_05]: is extremely challenging.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different than a lot of other
industries where there's ups and downs and
[SPEAKER_05]: unexpected territory.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, to have, uh, the family with
you and behind you is sacred.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, they helped me, uh, to the end of
this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I put roses in the garden,
James, because sometimes me and my wife
[SPEAKER_05]: might have a tough day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I want to remind myself to how
beautiful love is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that if I plant more roses in the
garden, that will remind me how beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: my life is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my wife is, and my children are all
the great people on this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, more of that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, the trees will grow up around
and the ganja plants will grow in the
[SPEAKER_05]: center.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can eat the fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always love walking around outdoor
patches with fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like on the garden tour,
like when you go through your room,
[SPEAKER_05]: room to room, you know, outdoor,
it's a bed to bed and you're eating the
[SPEAKER_05]: fresh fruit because everything is ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all comes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about genetics for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're a breeder, you do seed
production, you do a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought my box, brought the box from my,
this is part of my seed vault and it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: little dirty because it's dirty on the
hill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people talk about how you keep
your seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to keep mine in this generic box in
the garage in a cool place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you control humidity?
[SPEAKER_05]: It stays ambient and cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a three stall garage with an office
in a two room.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the back room is just kosher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, if I need to close the door,
run a heater, I mean a cooler,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dyslexic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of my genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't know about dyslexia.
[SPEAKER_05]: They always look at it as a, you know,
I was brought up as a learning disability
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's like, my mom was an amazing
advocate, taking me to India, helping me
[SPEAKER_05]: with my dyslexia and what people don't
realize is people with dyslexia get
[SPEAKER_05]: confused like the bus going from the left
to the right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually people know their route and they
go to the right side and they come up with
[SPEAKER_05]: similar answers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're dyslexic, you go to the
other side and I love the saying straight
[SPEAKER_05]: out of left field.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you come up with something different
and also have ADD where like I can single
[SPEAKER_05]: task better than anyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, people talk about ADD with
being losing your attention and not being
[SPEAKER_05]: able to focus, but it's actually quite the
opposite.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm loving that superhero
aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, my mom went to a seminar
about dyslexia and after they told them
[SPEAKER_05]: all these brilliant things that dyslexics
can do, the first question from the crowd
[SPEAKER_05]: was, what do I have to do to become
dyslexic?
[SPEAKER_05]: So to everyone out there that has that,
you know, I applaud you and it can be
[SPEAKER_05]: challenging, but it can also be rewarding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I brought the box.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black sheep genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had I said, you know, I wanted to
really just show you some of the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here it is like me and you make it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have fancy packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool with the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I also got our tried and true
sifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I brought out some my library.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can start checking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I came up with a really cool thing,
I think, for the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I like to be creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an inventor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an alchemist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's all this waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the seed packages, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody cares about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, I've counted so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the crowds, with the spinnies,
with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I had the epiphany.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about a pill pack?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that pill packs are made specific
sizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have like zero zero in a range.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I said, I could just go over the
swipe card like the way they fill pill
[SPEAKER_05]: packs as they have a board.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you set them in and then you just
swipe a card over it and it fills to the
[SPEAKER_05]: volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I match the volume to the quantity of
seeds and the size of the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm putting them in these gelatin
pill packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, that's biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great way to compact it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the future of this is
to have, you know, a 10 cell pack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shared pollen last year with 10
farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was an experiment, James,
let me tell you, to where some of them
[SPEAKER_05]: made some seeds, some of them didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_05]: My goal is that one day we can share
pollen and put in 10 of our selects from
[SPEAKER_05]: each different breeder and gift,
you know, that as, you know, ultimate
[SPEAKER_05]: phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have something that you really like
and to be able to take the pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, put it on 10 different things from
10 different people, and then grow those
[SPEAKER_00]: out and look at what was passed on by the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some interesting results and you
really start to understand your lines
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great way to understand
your breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a fun way to collaborate
with your friends and people that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Higher Heights is, you know, has high
standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, unless you make the four
plants, I'm not even willing to accept it
[SPEAKER_05]: as yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, he says you make the first
cross and then you make the second cross
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you cross those and then it's
yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he works with Shiloh a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed the show with you and
Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Organic Brian, like I said,
that's my other comrade.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I'm working with the nutrients
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So back to genetics, my ADD, I'm all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's run through some.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just give you some names and then we
can talk about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got the Pineapple Zasio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've got a couple Zasio crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the Z41.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Baccio 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still slapping out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got seeds of that in the next room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zasio cherry pie throwback classic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the problem with cherry pie?
[SPEAKER_05]: When we grew Girl Scout cookies and cherry
pie, I honestly like cherry pie better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they didn't cut PM in the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like, we can't run it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is a polyploid that I bred
pineapple caviar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I crossed Leo's pineapple tie.
[SPEAKER_05]: He searched the world like two times over
for it and found the original such a cool
[SPEAKER_05]: plant with his white caviar, which was
really nice plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's doing some breeding with it
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, he's brought it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking for his creme rosé.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got the creme rosé?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sheds fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta hit him up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I gotta hit him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think he has it right now,
but somebody has it out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Frenchy kept everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Frenchy was the vault for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: He explained that is every seed they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got some of his vanilla berry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2018, I ran it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was out in probably 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so out of a patch of a lot of plants
in my buddy's backyard, there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: little area of these white plants and they
stood out from 50 feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody that would go back there and
be like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the turps were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super turpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was berries and it was gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was very, very loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the expressions were loud out of 10
seeds or 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it was, but super
white and super frosty and sticky,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the old school sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see sticky as much as you used
to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a photographic memory for me,
James.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see vanilla berry pie on row
five in my upper patch, 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was similar because we had people
walking through the gardens and I kid you
[SPEAKER_05]: not, people said the exact same thing
coming through my patch being like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the structure of it, it branched out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grew so uniform and strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kept going.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leo gave me 20 of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad to bring back some of these
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about bringing that back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have popped.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Caleb, the librarian, CSI.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just released GDP.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gave the bubble to one of the best
indoor growers that I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I'm not sure if you're
going to want to run this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, death.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, yes, I, and as much as you
and I can grow, you know, you got to give
[SPEAKER_05]: some other things to other people because
we can't grow it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm doing the GDP and I'm doing the
Urkel from him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Urkel tends to be trickier where
he ran a couple of different phenols.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on his shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he had like plant number 106 and
103.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he made a cross of grape ape
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, yes, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to revitalize the perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think grape ape is genetics
wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not asking it as a trick question or
anything, but like grape ape, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: the big argument between grape ape and GDP
being sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're very different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're completely, they grow very
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understand, Mr. Perps man made
the grape ape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's somebody else out there
trying to take credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not even going to say his name on
the show, but, you know, either way,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape ape was a, it would stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas fucking GDP would be small and
dude, pungent, super pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think grape ape was more subtle.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to run nine plants in a four by
four.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had played with all the numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, if you were growing GDP,
the magic number was nine for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad used to run a flashlight over my
canopy when I started apprenticing under
[SPEAKER_05]: him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, if he could see the light,
then I was screwing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, our canopies are so soft.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we used to run, you know, uh,
back in the day, there was two types of
[SPEAKER_05]: growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to say, you know, in the,
on the ends, there was the PG and E
[SPEAKER_05]: growers and there was the other growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we were putting up three lights per
table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the ultimate goal of getting,
you know, four pounds out of a four by
[SPEAKER_05]: eight table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three lights per table, three six
hundreds, three thousand, three thousands
[SPEAKER_05]: on a three thousand.
[SPEAKER_05]: My old man was a savage where we bought
Horolux and we're suckers for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then he was like, check this out son.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he pops open a case and it's GE's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got them for 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, we're relamping every
run.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he loved cleaning the ballast out right
next to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have 3000s on a four by four.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Split the table with 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did, I did 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did thousands like that,
but we did 300.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to do ebb and flow, flood and
drain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And GDP was like, I grew it for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mothered it for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had, like I said, the hell's angels cut,
which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found that it was like a swamp
plant, James.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to flood my trays for 12 hours and
then let them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the purplest, happiest plant it
ever could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what type of hoods did you use when you
were going 3000s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you guys use the air cooled?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you were, we were, we were using six
inch air cooled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My old man would go to the grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we used to go up the street here to
growers choice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Metallica's band would come in and buy
stuff from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd see other people and they had
their pit bulls that are like scariest pit
[SPEAKER_05]: bulls known to man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my dad would break out the light
meter.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the grow store and he was friends with
Steve and he'd have Steve turn all the
[SPEAKER_05]: lights on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my dad was geek.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a scientist.
[SPEAKER_05]: My father actually did missile propulsion
for Raytheon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he was just straight specking the
lights and we found the top ballast from,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all the ones that they had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time, I believe we were
working with Hordelux or no, it wasn't sun
[SPEAKER_05]: sun something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sun systems, sun systems or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old thousand watt metal ballast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we used to have to replace caps,
bring it to the grow store, get a new cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ballast were separate, a whole different
world back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put the ballast above the room
if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're real smart, you put them above
the room because there was all that
[SPEAKER_00]: buzzing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to also hang our cleaners,
our scrubbers above the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that, you know, I love because so
many people use the scrubbers the right
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you use a scrubber the right way,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Using it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the way I came to figure it out
was you run it backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we used to reverse the flow and
instead of blow out, we'd suck in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my dad would joke about it because we
had a 12 inch fan on top of a big,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd be like, don't get your hair cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: That hippie like pull on your hat and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people were walking by it,
but it was way more productive and you
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't have to duct it or, you know,
just to reverse it and slam it back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: My old man was diligent about building the
rooms where when you shut the door,
[SPEAKER_05]: it would suck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had that reverse pressure,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All about that reverse pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I said your new room's flat white.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite color in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about how you got started
with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, did you what did you start
breeding for?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was started breeding because,
you know, I had done all other facets
[SPEAKER_05]: where, you know, you get tired of repeat
and I always like to my old man said,
[SPEAKER_05]: push the science and experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I get pissed because he'd run
around perfect and they change something
[SPEAKER_05]: up and it wouldn't be as good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he made his case for, you know,
pushing things forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, I think when I had
finished up, you know, indoors and went to
[SPEAKER_05]: outs, then I did some depths and I did
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the final frontier for me
was breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, to have the chance to
make my own plant was the most special
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went into that and you said the palm
chucking before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was halfway into that story with I
got inspired by the Gowder family,
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikey G and his father.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I'm going to ask the
illest breeder I know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says to me, so you got to separate out
the male that you like and repot it up
[SPEAKER_05]: about a mile away from everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, you put it into a big pot
or in the ground, just like you do the
[SPEAKER_05]: other plants and you let it get here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, man, this is a huge
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, this is a serious project.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with his wisdom, I went on that kind
of ride.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had this male that was giant in my
garden that I let rip and I didn't know
[SPEAKER_05]: what the hell to do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I banged it a little bit and the
pollen drifted on like three plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was growing wasque at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, I want to make seeds and
every because we use hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, it'll be even better chocolate
milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, oh, I messed that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm by myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we know in cannabis, you can have a lot
of friends when it comes to working in the
[SPEAKER_05]: field.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on your own.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took the plant and I went,
which and the pollen went up like 50 feet
[SPEAKER_05]: in the air with a huge plume.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I watched it just crush the entire
batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, well, I guess I check that
box.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, then you get more into it
and, you know, really being inspired with
[SPEAKER_05]: learning about, you know, Punnett squares,
about, you know, IBL's S ones,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, breeding forwards, breeding
backwards and and all the diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was in a hot spot in Round Valley
that has some of the most ancient genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, from natives, from veterans,
from a lot of people who have grown there
[SPEAKER_05]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was really fortunate with to be able
to go to these breeders and start,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, getting the genetics that I
liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a breeder told me a long time ago and
he was spot on when he said to me,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when you start breeding,
you'll figure out what flavors you like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all like different flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to kind of drive your
train.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, with that in mind,
then I started to, you know, find specific
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars and and growers and reach out to
them, build that terroir network and
[SPEAKER_05]: develop, you know, my own.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so fast forward to today, I got a
couple more we'll run through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, these are special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody gifted me these at Eagle Clash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're hemp seeds, James,
that grow 25 foot tall hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I need some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to see how large the seeds are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a look.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got some other seeds where we can
put those next to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, huge seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is unreal how I was so pumped.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, that's what I went to Eagle Clash
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, it's just another like we
said, the plant is so diverse,
[SPEAKER_05]: like no one you can constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are point zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess I can weigh this and I'm
pretty good at guessing weight because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are point zero force.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see point zero force almost
never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are I have some point zero one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are four times bigger,
if not bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got the here's some other flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lemon cherry skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got G10.
[SPEAKER_05]: G10, I said, is the highest note you can
hit when people sing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This shit gets you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kicks you in the nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only that, you're ready for drum
roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drum roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drum roll.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It finishes in August and it's not an auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: No auto flower genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got early Afghan genetics that I
believe have like this really early photo
[SPEAKER_05]: period.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard to sex those plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed some of these ones that I've
found and I've bred.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a couple strains that finish in
August.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a collab with Leo and I called one
the rain bird.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's this bird that shows up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also called like the Pika Kua.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows up before monsoons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people always talk about science and
spirit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a big vice for me in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we know, there's been lots of turmoil
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this bird represents the spirit and
science caught up with the bird and they
[SPEAKER_05]: were able to track the bird.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to prove the law comes to find out,
James, the spirit story and the legend is
true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that the bird migrates in front of the
rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you see that bird, that means
that a monsoon is coming or that the rain
[SPEAKER_05]: is on its way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thus the giving it that name because
the cannabis comes in before the rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said the people in Maine,
the people in Canada, the people in all
[SPEAKER_05]: these climates need those genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they are out there in their
fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the happiest person and then
they're crying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because frost came.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just devastated them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of that, we've talked about a
frost solution for everyone too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we said is to wait till the sun
is cresting and as it's tracking in on the
[SPEAKER_05]: patch to spray the plants with water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe there's a chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't tried it yet, but you know,
if you caught it in that window,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe it wouldn't burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So doing genetics that finish early for
people, giving people what they need,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, working with the plant to make
the magic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the true breeding work is in the phenol
hunting and the selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 seeds minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 seeds minimum for you to do your
selections.
[SPEAKER_05]: Minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do your selections outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly you do inside as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing them all outside now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're breeding for outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you breed indoors for indoor
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You breed outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your seeds indoor for
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of guys, when you're
doing a selection process, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for outdoor, you better be
selecting for outdoor for that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's complicated, though, when I like pass
on a plant outdoors because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: check the three boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: One box isn't checked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my friend calls me up and he's
like, do you still have any of number
[SPEAKER_05]: four?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, well, come over to my
greenhouse and take a look.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, it's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you never know the expressions in
the multi environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, there needs to be more of
that and more science, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: because again, when people come to us for
genetics, we might have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, it doesn't work in this
environment, but it slays in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Society testing in multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good because expressions come
so differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor from one region to the next can be
completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse can be different side by side
with your outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm bringing back the skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the latest issue of Skunk
Magazine?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, well, Julie is an angel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got in there with a strain review on
the winter issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unlike I've ever seen in any strain
reviews, James.
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a male in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dankest stud, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: This male blew me away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like it has a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I'm not worthy plant does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I found the skunk in my patch where I
had one plant come up and I thought the
[SPEAKER_05]: patch got sprayed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, literally, I was looking for a skunk
and I live in the hills.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what a fucking skunk smells like my
French.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then I'm stumbling around the patch
looking and I come up on the plant and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: like, oh, dang, there it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Putrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, insane, like overrode every
plant in the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like excited and that was the
year that I did the open pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't know where or when that would
show back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I collected that seed from the plant
and then I dealt with some strife in my
[SPEAKER_05]: life and I got cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this plant is special to me and has
been, you know, my passion, my journey,
[SPEAKER_05]: but little did I know it was also going to
be my savior.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, growing out genetics,
whether it be CBD, like we said,
[SPEAKER_05]: CBG, THC, it's all medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you believe it or not,
it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis Prohn said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's one of the best lines
ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I kind of had to step
back from everything and my family and my
[SPEAKER_05]: friends helped me get through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got amazing treatment from not only
Western medicine, but also Eastern
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: My sister is a naturopathic doctor and a
graduate from Bastyr, big ups is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I tacked it with everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was eating RSO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless its heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was giving it out in the waiting room.
[SPEAKER_05]: People will say thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you can't give out cake there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when people are getting chemotherapy,
but you can give out RSO.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it hasn't gone full stream
where they even have the fake cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: that they prescribe to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Marinol.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Marinol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Straight trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, there's all these great
people that are willing to donate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was donated medicine to help me get
through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: With putting one foot in front of the
other, I was happy that I could walk
[SPEAKER_05]: through hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my family and I persevered on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm a new version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy James Sam back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you're here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, to be able to continue to
work with the plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And gone through cancer and come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it changed me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so much more humbled.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so much more grateful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate, you know, the elders for
their humility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to listen more and talk less.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming back to the table now, I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was I was a little bit, you know,
in recovery still, but I never gave up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew the whole way through and I went
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a video on me online where I
went out to the field and I said I
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't hand water that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I put a rain bird out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my whole family went up with me and I
said, let's just go chuck seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got bags of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, I can just toss it like
Johnny Appleweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And went out there and told people about
how great it was and direct selling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck direct sold and Moroccan style,
the Moroccan style or Las Vegas style.
[SPEAKER_05]: My one of the we should intersect here
because it's radical.
[SPEAKER_05]: No manners.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever heard of the Manners family?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manners family.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a quad OG or was rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Capistrana.
[SPEAKER_05]: You ever heard that name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: He invented the heart stint and he owns a
ranch in Kovalo and he's about as tough as
[SPEAKER_05]: they come.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he still runs cattle like cowboys down
the road with leather coats.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they got their McNabb dogs and they
block traffic and they ride through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's a real rancher.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at Noles Wake, Capistrana came up to
me with the cowboy hat.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, was he said?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, was a quad OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had never heard that before.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that size again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I named a strain after it
with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to, you know, get on that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quad OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, Noel is the person that brought
the Afu and their family farms is gooey
[SPEAKER_05]: farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was kind of Eddie Lep page with
grows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You look working with huge amounts of
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: He told me stories about doing the loops
from California to Texas with duffel bags
[SPEAKER_05]: in the airports and back to Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm riding his car.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're pretty special to ride
with the Godfather.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering what we're going to talk
about one of my favorite places to be in
[SPEAKER_05]: the car.
[SPEAKER_05]: He says to me, I went to Las Vegas and I
was working this guy and he was growing in
[SPEAKER_05]: pools and he ripped out 12 pools and they
were in all these different places and
[SPEAKER_05]: they would just go like me and open
broadcast seed and then grow it up in the
[SPEAKER_05]: pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he said he went to check in on
things with his partner and that the
[SPEAKER_05]: person coming to the gate was late and he
was in a fancy like the guy had a fancy
[SPEAKER_05]: Corvette and was sipping around because
he's the magic man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And Noel is a partner with and so he's
trying to impress him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy that came up to the gate,
he goes off on and it was his son.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started yelling at him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why weren't you here?
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have been here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You knew we were coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the Godfather said, red flag,
there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he said, I called up my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told them that I didn't think I was
going to be able to come home and that I
[SPEAKER_05]: was going to have to see this thing
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he stayed a couple of days and
sure enough, there were like three more
[SPEAKER_05]: other buyer partners that he didn't know
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had to stay there and see the course
from from, you know, middle to finish.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said to me, you know, the hard part
was when I told that to my family,
[SPEAKER_05]: she said, that's OK, his wife,
but I might not be here when you come
[SPEAKER_05]: home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he stayed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she wasn't there when he came home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a story, you know,
that you hear it changes you and share it
[SPEAKER_05]: with me for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'm grateful again to have
my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, they learned to get along
later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had another relationship and I love
seeing families that can separate and then
[SPEAKER_05]: hang out in the room and be have a good
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's me, the black sheep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not how I went with my family a lot
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he brought in all the you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the name came.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, black sheep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black sheep come from that came from,
you know, my family background of being a
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a rogue character getting into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I had a lot of
fallout.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad battled with his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have restraining orders.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother had to pull him off his brother,
you know, and take his guns away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it got pretty ugly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I said we were a band of
two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And me and Pops, you know, tread the
ground with class for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my mom and him got separated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm good with my mother.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's an amazing person in my life as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bless moms.
[SPEAKER_05]: All moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your take on social media?
[SPEAKER_05]: Social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm I think that there's great things I
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like a multiverse,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a blessing and a curse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's I don't want to be scrolling
and have my kids call me out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're scrolling on your phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like eating food and seeing people
on scrolling, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do like the connectivity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like how many fun people we've
reached out to, like that this show is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to touch, you know, the shine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, any of the beef or the
haters, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the more you come up, the more
they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a it's just a, you know,
props to you because you're actually doing
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like me and you are working on
very important work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not of the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's of what people will remember in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, to build the legend,
to build the legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody wants to find out more
about you or get your genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: where can they go?
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go to Dark Heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard he said I was talking with him or
not Dark Heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Dark Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Star.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said Tito was on your show and that
he gave him some props, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tino's the man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like, props to different shows on
James Love.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Detroit Rock City.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love to get my genetics there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got about eight or nine different
places throughout the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can find seed banks that I'm
available on your black sheep genetics on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black sheep genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some great reels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a family man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's been great having you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: My new breeding book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to check out the breeding
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to JamesLadGenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this fun book that has three
hundred and eighty pages about genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants and all my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on a final note, I wanted to tell you
because this is really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this bud is I'm calling it the leather
because it's tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you smoke it, you're going to get
faded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's from the legendary family that we
spoke of, the Gouders and James guy that's
[SPEAKER_05]: helping him out building his rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of his right hand men said that he
worked with the guy that grew this in
[SPEAKER_05]: Kovala, where I'm like, it's a small
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my guy, Matt, he's the head grower with
JamesLadGenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He small world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to work with the guy that grew the
flower that's in your hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him a nickname because he's he's
just a rogue character.
[SPEAKER_05]: He lives in a cave.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm coined him the cave man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's his new nickname.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he likes it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to stick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this weed was cured in a cave.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like some estate aging where you
know, I had to do some love when I got it
[SPEAKER_05]: home a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the long cure getting getting wet,
getting dry, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: No fuzz on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just bringing out those great flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So part of the gift is, James,
that this is my favorite strain of the
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's seeds in it for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even better.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even better.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to smoke it through.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favorite ways to pull seeds out
is to smoke them through it, drop them in
[SPEAKER_05]: a little special jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll run some here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: So big up to this, the leather,
all the people growing out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to having you back someday.
