[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today our special guest is the
legendary Kyle Cushman, High Times
[SPEAKER_02]: magazine, internet personality,
the guy who was willing to show his face
[SPEAKER_02]: for the planet long before most of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kind of set the bounds for other
people like myself to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: platform like this to talk about cannabis
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've we've hung out and met,
you know, we've hung out a couple of times
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's really great to have
you on the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: How, James?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been 30, 30, 30 plus years as
Kyle Cushman now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I've pretty much become Kyle
Cushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have embodied Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown into the shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are big shoes to fill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've really paved the way for so
many people, you know, not just myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but so many people in the industry to be
able to do what we do now without people
[SPEAKER_02]: like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a handful of other people that
were really willing to like Jack Hare,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hair like terror.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, hair like terror.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we need to get that right on the
podcast, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just remember hair like terror.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, you've paved the way and done a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've won cannabis cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been advocate for legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've really kind of pushed the bounds as
far as veganics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can even talk veganics today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think veganics pushing
boundaries and your strawberry cough that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've won multiple awards with has been
legendary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my strawberry cough is a little bit of
a heavy statement because, as you and I
[SPEAKER_04]: both know, I did not create the strawberry
cough, but I was gifted it and happily
[SPEAKER_04]: carried it with with with me to this very
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You elevated to the level it's at now and
your name is synonymous with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like even though you didn't
breed it, when I think of strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: cough, I think of Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: So well, you heard last night I went out
to give out an award and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_04]: people shouted strawberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went cough and then I went,
when I say strawberry, you say and I did a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of rounds of strawberry and I was
like, wow, that was fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was completely impromptu.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's a it's sliding doors,
brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I took my job at high times,
I had to quit growing weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't handle the pressure of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I started slinging packs again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my dealer was in Bridgeport,
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every couple of weeks, I drive from
Brooklyn to Bridgeport, Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_04]: pick up some weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one time my buddy is like,
hey, man, I got this really good friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: He lives around the block.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he he really wants to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you go over there with me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hop in his car.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go around the block.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go to his friend's house and I go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man, I'm so excited to meet you and
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and he shows me a bag where he has a
piece of weed the size of my pinky nail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I'm really sorry,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had more.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all you want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stoned off my ass anyways,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, I want to show it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he takes me down into his basement and
he's got a little garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't flowering, just some vegging
plants being polite and honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the way up the stairs, he's like
taps me on the shoulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, hey, would you like one?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked at this plant and it was
literally in a Dixie cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember those bathroom little Dixie?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had about two inches of surface area of
leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the tiniest little pinky sized
clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, of course, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I and I said, can you get me a bag?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we went into his pantry and he took
a lunch bag, a new lunch bag, flacked it
[SPEAKER_04]: open and gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I drove it three hours back to New
York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I brought it in the apartment,
brought it up into my apartment thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to throw it away,
you know, because I don't grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I took it out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I took it out of the bag,
I got a whiff of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did like a double, a triple,
a quadruple take and smelled the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking to myself, did this guy pull
something on me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know I saw him take that bag out
of the closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a new bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, this is not possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: This tiny little clone is giving me the
aroma of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just I couldn't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gave it to my German friend over
Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you will grow this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And three years later, it was the most
popular delivery weed in New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a few years later, it became the
strains strained in the used in children
[SPEAKER_04]: of men.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love good origin stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's like, had you not
gotten the plant at the time you got it,
[SPEAKER_02]: who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have gotten lost along the wayside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may have never been elevated to the
point where it was winning cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other things that have gone on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, strawberry cough times O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Bruce Banner, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there would be no Bruce
Banner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just amazing how these genetics and
these these small points in time where we
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with these things, you know,
and recognizing that it was special being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to elevate that to the status it is
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, at that time,
I'd already been growing for eight or 10
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had experience with we didn't even
call it terpene profiles back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just the nose, the nose nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the nose nose nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's it's that sliding door
thing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like I just very easily could
have said, you know, I'm not growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool name and chucked it in the
bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it would have made its way
out somehow, but it certainly wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have become what it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just grateful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really grateful to be associated with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's so many blessings that
we've been gifted along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like with something like
strawberry cough, genetic preservation
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't what it is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was much harder to keep stuff alive for
the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many things I've lost along the
way side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many great things that we had,
so many great things that my friends had
[SPEAKER_02]: where I had at one point and I gave it to
somebody to hold or I gave it to multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: people to hold family members,
even where it was like they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: hold it forever and it's not there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've lost some amazing stuff or the
cops took it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops took it on a raid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happened to so many people,
you know, and you just don't hear those
[SPEAKER_02]: stories anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you about my Brutus interruptus
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've two times I had a one time
it was almost six or seven or eight years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another time was four or five years of a
project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Taken away, taken out of my hands by a
bust, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I mean, the strawberry cough
to this day is my favorite strain to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't found anything that is as has
the clarity of high that literally I'm you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, I'm going to get baked and I may
have a brain fart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I may forget what I'm saying,
but that happens to people who don't smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: pot, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, it's it's extremely
stimulating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Creatively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that if you like to ride
bikes, you're going to ride your bike a
[SPEAKER_04]: little farther.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like to mountain climb,
you're going to you're going to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: that, you know, and it's rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue dream, because I feel like blue dream
is similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue dream, similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's several other things that are
similar, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I used to call a blue dream
strawberry cough light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my wife, when we first met,
she couldn't handle strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she absolutely loved blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started calling blue dream strawberry
cough light.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that funny quote about blue dream?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you if you if you say you
hate blue dream, you don't know nothing
[SPEAKER_04]: about weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you say you like blue dream,
you know, Craig was on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say you love blue dream,
you don't know anything about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you say you hate blue dream,
you really don't know anything about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's truth to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally was in a parking lot in Marin
County and I was bringing some strawberry
[SPEAKER_04]: cough to a friend, Molly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her name was Molly, who wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she literally as a gift, she said,
check out this new strain my friend
[SPEAKER_04]: created.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know who the creator of blue dream
was?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hayes Brothers, the Hayes Brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that would.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, I tried the blue the the blue
dream like the summer it came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and yeah, that, you know, who can
argue with a strain that is enlivening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That grows like a son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it has the best structure,
the best as far as roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what strawberry cough doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strawberry cough has the structure above
the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this wonderful chunky haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But below the ground, it's a little bit
finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And blue dream has the best root turps out
of anything I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as root turps are, when you
basically pull the root ball up and you
[SPEAKER_02]: give them a nice whiff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try blue dream and it has a big
like the root ball is big, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's tons of turps in the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Turps been a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I call them turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what else to call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, root turps are real.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get full on never sniffed my roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably extract root turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would guarantee that you could extract
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go home and sniff some root
turps right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And blue dream has that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blueberry is super intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else is a new thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: A new tech, a new tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the young kids think that their
favorite song is actually written by the
[SPEAKER_04]: band that they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it was written in the 60s or 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: By Frank Sinatra or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the Beatles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's that new tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I can't keep a train of thought that
new tech where they you go out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: field and you you resin gland test things
in water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the resin dial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's not that old.
[SPEAKER_04]: People haven't been doing that on camera
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have been doing some more stuff
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it doesn't get popularized nor
passed along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it was, you know, because we talk
about cannabis, you know, there's the
[SPEAKER_02]: University, which I think does a great job
at what they do as far as education.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this industry is a mentorship
apprenticeship type industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the best way to learn would be
to learn from somebody who is doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could learn by trial and error,
but it takes a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you found somebody that would take
you under their wing, they would educate
[SPEAKER_02]: you and tell you everything that they know
to make you better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very much like the culinary world I
talk about on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that was the beauty of and
that is the beauty of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a good person and somebody
sees something that they like or that they
[SPEAKER_02]: feel that you're worthy, then they teach
you and they educate you and show you all
[SPEAKER_02]: the tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that stuff stayed very closed doored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't shared with everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and that's really kind of I'm kind of
I've always been the ant antithesis of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when I grew Gorilla Style,
I don't think I knew another grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was truly underground.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think like, OK, like I
didn't know a few other like you would
[SPEAKER_04]: meet at a concert or you would you would
and then they would be like from another.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did not actually know any other
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how underground I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where did you get your information
from back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: High Times magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought myself out of High Times
magazine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought myself the Growers Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bought myself about both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Indoor Growers Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was the just the larger one
that included all the other information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day, one of my pot dealer from
back then, I was just selling weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He he comes in my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just rented a brand new condominium with
a walk in closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, my pot dealer, he says,
hey, man, he says, if you let me grow in
[SPEAKER_04]: your closet, I'll teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I swear to you, at that moment,
at that time, you know how there's you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know how every plant grows in the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, like, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does leachy grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a tree or is it underground?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know how every plant grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at that time, I had no concept of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could grow marijuana indoors like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like none, like I knew it was a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't grow every plant indoors back in
1986.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he says, I'll teach you how to grow if
you let me grow in your closet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he brought over an Emily's Garden,
one of those first ebb and flow from
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two and a half gallon reservoir
with a tray on top, you know, and filled
[SPEAKER_04]: with perlite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and he brings me over a tub of
green powder and a tub of purple powder,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and he brings me over some pH
test strips and 400 watt HID with a
[SPEAKER_04]: conversion bulb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says and all he says is he says you
do one teaspoon per gallon of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You change water at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pH it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You change the water every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you when it's time to I'll tell
you when it's time to flip the lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you start using this powder.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pH it and you put it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You change the water every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first buds that I grew my first
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, they weren't that big.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the size of soda cans.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were the size of a 12 ounce soda can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I looked in this little closet and I
said to myself, self, your life is never
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a few days later, somebody who I told
about the garden while I was at work
[SPEAKER_04]: through a three pound dumbbell weight
through my back window and came in and
[SPEAKER_04]: stole it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: First harvest I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my good friend, Danny Pollock,
came over that night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big guy, six foot four or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had to tell him what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he picked me up by my neck with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not like really high, but as hard
as he could with the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought I was about to get,
you know, one of these in the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just kind of threw me back on my
bed because the closet was in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the very first harvest I ever grew
taught me how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was ripped off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was many, I got robbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that happened to my brother too
growing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember seeing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got robbed by Philadelphia Narcotics
Detectives in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know for a fact it was cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: They robbed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't be the first time that's
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, these are, you know,
it's a life, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, everybody does things for
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did it for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how old were you?
[SPEAKER_04]: When this started?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was probably, let's see, I out processed
out of the army at 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was 21 or 22 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe it was 23.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a couple of years out, 23 or 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I started growing and I'm 58 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The landscape has changed drastically and
the amount of knowledge is, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: wild because even though it is,
and it can be a mentorship type thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can watch podcasts like your podcast
and learn how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch YouTube and learn how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read magazines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the knowledge is out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to do it, it's out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just go do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to grow shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you live in Texas, there's grow
shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like Bob Ross.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the old Bob Ross show,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Bob Ross, people say
sometimes I have mannerisms like him,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know what the cool thing about,
I thought what Bob Ross was?
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a special characteristic and that
was that he could make every single person
[SPEAKER_04]: who watched his show feel like if you
wanted to, you could go down to Frank's
[SPEAKER_04]: Crafts, pick up some supplies and come
home and do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been my motivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make it feel like if you just kind of
listen a little bit, watch, go get
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself some equipment, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need more motivating people
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we have a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of people sharing stuff
and there's a lot of good podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your podcast is excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: First smoke of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good pizza podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Seeds to Harvest podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a Rue on a while back and really
cool, you know, and there's lots of good
[SPEAKER_02]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I think it's so much different
than throughout history because I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like now we're at this point where we're
really painting a true picture of what the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry looks like and what the people go
through and what the people have gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just from the perspective of a
small group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's the perspective of thousands of
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to push history on these young
folks these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are open minds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of this fucking smack me
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 75 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard the other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: My ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not smoking 70 weed, a flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 75 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: You believe that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not looking at you like you believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can make the lab test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Test is 75 with a bunch of Keefe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's not even Keefe,
but you can get THC probably and just code
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you roll it and code it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not that's not real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why have we not enlisted science?
[SPEAKER_04]: To do a simple study.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they've already done it with other
agricultural plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can tell you what the max brick level
of an apple is.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple can only have this much sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why can't science tell us what the
max THC put through math?
[SPEAKER_04]: Math will tell you it has to have so much
other constituents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cellulose, fiber, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so how much of it could possibly
be THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to support the THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many other things at play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a separate discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I just want to stop bullshitting
people with the number, with the
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll discuss whether it matters so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd like it to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I feel like that's one thing that
needs more oversight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it doesn't need more oversight,
but the testing across the board needs to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going legalization, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as legalization is concerned,
testing needs to go and have more
[SPEAKER_02]: oversight and more consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as a whole across the United
States, there should be some consistency
[SPEAKER_02]: with testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a person goes and buys this flower here
or there or there or whatever state you're
[SPEAKER_02]: in and they get consistent results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to product,
going for a product and it's 23% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what you're getting to a degree
with, even though it doesn't tell the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both know that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is relatable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can smoke some.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does relate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want, I don't want people
thinking that, you know, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: anything to do with how high it's going to
get you because it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can smoke some 12% Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will get you to where you don't
want to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a rarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you were growing out all kinds of
crappy cultivars that only came out at
[SPEAKER_04]: 12%, the majority of them are going to be
crappy and not get people high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a rarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of the time, the THC percentage
does have relevance.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to put it in its proper
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there just needs to be more
consistency and less bullshitting.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that the world in general or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially us stoners, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but now there's so much motivation
from these testing labs to inflate the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers, you know, and for the,
you know, it's like the political
[SPEAKER_02]: revolving door.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got a testing company.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the one and only when it first
starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get a relationship with the
competitions and then the relationships
[SPEAKER_04]: grow and other ones come out and this,
I will do it cheaper.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as a manufacturer, you want the
highest results possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a testing lab, you want to get the
most manufacturers possible using you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want the highest test results
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just, and it sucks that it's like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe everything just needs to be double
verified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double verified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Testing it once is not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to a lab that's at least a
hundred miles away from the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need two certifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some states, you can send whatever
sampling you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other states, they get to pick the
sample out of a larger source.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's no consistency across the
board and it's going to have to happen on
[SPEAKER_02]: a federal level with federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're moving forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not making progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're absolutely making progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that's maybe taken a back
seat to progress is the actual cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: culture itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, look, I haven't given up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a fatalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's part of my mission here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure people are still
smoking a joint 20 years from now and not
[SPEAKER_04]: acting like it's an old foggy thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if it's not in a pen,
who are you, Gramps?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but the culture, the culture
that reared me is important to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't understate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: From high times to being welcomed into the
heart of the Emerald Triangle as a
[SPEAKER_04]: journalist, you don't think I got some
threats while living up there too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole thing, it's a
wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very meaningful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it, nearly every good person I've
met in my life is somehow related to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met my wife because I consented to teach
the first Oakster Dam University class
[SPEAKER_04]: that they taught out of state was in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dale called me up and she said,
I can't offer you much money, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: a $250 honorarium, but you know,
I'll fly you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to teach a class in
Detroit?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where I met my wife.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could have very easily said no to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sliding doors, man, and all the doors
that cannabis opened for me are just...
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the times I went to jail,
I got a scar on my leg from a motorcycle
[SPEAKER_04]: accident.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I didn't have that motorcycle
accident, I never would have met high
[SPEAKER_04]: times.
[SPEAKER_04]: The place that I moved after that is why I
walked into that head shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I didn't have that motorcycle
accident, I never would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think so many people are
afraid to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you fail, failing's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Failing is a good learning experience a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take the good out of every
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the things where it's so
counterintuitive, this thing we call life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you think it's one way when you're
younger, and then you realize a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: that is the complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's important in life?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, don't be afraid to fail because
you should be afraid when you're taking
[SPEAKER_04]: risks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, it's not all about accepting that
participation trophy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: And no risk, no reward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to want to do it at a high level,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, now more than ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not to start, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got to want something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to have some dedication,
and then you have to find focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my problem has always been focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's why I don't have big businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a meager existence kind of guy because
all I really need is good food,
[SPEAKER_04]: love, contentment, a little bit of
serenity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need a mansion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want a mansion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a mansion that I have to
guard with guard dogs and cameras.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want autonomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to make my own
decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess I got what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because when you're
younger, you know enough to make yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as what everything is
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you get older, you start learning
more about things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time you're in your 40s,
you realize you've just scratched the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface on most of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just starting to appreciate
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you get into your 50s,
I don't know yet because I'm not there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm assuming you just get smarter and
smarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got married at 45, 46.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be 58.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got married at 49, 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got married at 49, 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got married at 49, 50 for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd been engaged a couple of times,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I wouldn't go back and do it all
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you always say if I knew what I
knew now, but you don't get to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I'm doing is I'm kind of
giving props to the young ones who do have
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is not, you know, it may be
easier because we have a lot more things
[SPEAKER_04]: we can do by pushing a button,
but you don't learn anything by pushing a
[SPEAKER_04]: button.
[SPEAKER_04]: The car starts, it takes you where you
want to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, you don't, you know,
you don't learn anything that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And me growing up, everything I did,
I was learning something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything I did, the things that my
parents told me not to do, that I went out
[SPEAKER_04]: and did, whether it was build a go-kart or
build a raft or go in the lake when you
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't supposed to, you know,
everything I did was learning something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'd like young people younger
than me to realize is that the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: the world is huge and life is long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Life is not, people like to say,
oh, isn't the world small?
[SPEAKER_04]: What a small world.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's one way to look at it,
but see, I got a different view.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the appreciation goes the other
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think if every human lived to be
two, 300 years old, I think we'd have a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot less assholes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because see, if you know, you're only
going to be around for 60, 70 years,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can be an asshole for 20, 30 years and
think you can just keep running around and
[SPEAKER_04]: get away with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't catch up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're going to be around for 200,
300 years, you're going to watch whose
[SPEAKER_04]: toes you step on.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, so I'd rather look at it like life is
long and everything I do is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually come back on me somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the difference between the
forties and fifties because I'm in this
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset that life is short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only have a, I have a lot of stuff
that I want to do before I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like, um, I, like I said,
the world is a big place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a small world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, I mean, there are so many places to
visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many kinds of people in the
sense that we like to say we're all the
[SPEAKER_04]: same.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are, I get that is a truism.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you can't stretch that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But beyond that, if you can get out,
there are so many shades of colors in
[SPEAKER_04]: between.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to say, uh, I like to,
I don't want to close my eyes to anything
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't want to put headphones on
because I always want to be able to see
[SPEAKER_04]: the colors in between the colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to hear the sounds in between
the sounds, you know, I don't ever want to
[SPEAKER_04]: block out anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though sometimes it's annoying,
you know, well, I want to hear that
[SPEAKER_04]: screech when it's coming towards me so I
can get the fuck out of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's metaphorical as much as it is
literal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I like seeing the bad weed as
much as I like seeing the good weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funny statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you like seeing the bad weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like seeing the bad weed because I
like contrast and I feel like you can
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate the good stuff if you can see
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to see it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no light without the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is none.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I can see the worst stuff and a
lot of ugly stuff, which I still like ugly
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you get away with saying that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean, but it's, it's ugly,
but it's, but it smokes amazing,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I like amazing weed, but, but the look
is now is a qualifier for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we're, we're a little bit older
than these new guys and social media
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that played a huge role into
me believing that and seeing the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that I saw growing up, it wasn't always
the good weed that I wanted to buy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the good looking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just made me think you really refined
a thought that I've, I've been saying a
[SPEAKER_04]: few, uh, uh, over the years, a good friend
of mine, DJ short, famous for the
[SPEAKER_04]: blueberry and others, which I can't
remember the flow, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he once said to me, and he said,
he says this in public, he says,
[SPEAKER_04]: I breed for only one characteristic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what that is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Effect.
Effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why do we use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of how it makes us feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can't isolate that, that's the
most important factor above the smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we just said, you know, we're not
going to smoke shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I make weed and when I decided to
make a cross, you know, many times I've
[SPEAKER_04]: crossed strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the outcome was not better than the
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it wasn't better, I threw it
in the dumper and I've never made anything
[SPEAKER_04]: better with the strawberry cough to this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of feel like it's another
Skittles because Skittles is the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff that has Skittles
in it, but is it better than Skittles?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's subjective, but like, and there's
like, it's about the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about, we all got a bell,
you know, and you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's exactly why most of these hybrids
just don't do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the breeders were not focused on
simply the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was second, third, fourth, fifth of all
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all have to come into alignment.
[SPEAKER_04]: First it's got to look good, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the worst approach to all this,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and then, oh, it smokes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets, no, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's got white ash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to buy the tomato that has the
funky veins, the heirloom tomato.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's broken open a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only the last three days in your
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to go bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already started to split,
you know, those are the, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you mean by I still like ugly
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because Dave Mesford,
I don't know if you ever met Dave Mesford.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did Kanekon, long hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just passed on 420.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was his, what was his nickname?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was, he was a character.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a character, but his, like my last,
I interviewed him a week before.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed and it affected me so much
because I realized I've been breeding for
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor the last five years, really focused
on flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, I, and in my
justification for that, because before
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was all about effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what their first assumption is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what their first impression is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a breeder, you're like,
oh, this smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was, I lost sight of that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we've kind of reached where we
focused over the last few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, we need to really focus
on effect and how these things make you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel, because that's really the most
important thing at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it looks important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The yield is important, but like,
if we can just put a little more focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: that effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, you know, and that is the
hardest because it's, it's probably the
[SPEAKER_04]: most subjective and it varies the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like from person to person.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people, strawberry cost,
strawberry cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to go, oh yeah, that's a
berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you ask them how it makes you feel,
it could, you could get a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: different answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's why testing and
sharing it with so many people is so
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no baseline for effect.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is uncertain effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that baseline is going to be different
for me.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're breeding, you know, I like to
say when you're smoking weed, you're
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking the breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so really what breeding should be
about, this is what I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is my art.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a representation of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it all, it all is and underlying all
of it, there's a motivation behind why you
[SPEAKER_04]: chose to propagate that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that reason should be because it rang
your fucking bell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And DJ shorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always said that it's all about effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been preaching that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's funny how many of us older
guys have experience with DJ short and his
[SPEAKER_02]: words of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he told, I was so hyped up about
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: 12, 13, 13, 14 years ago, you know,
when we first got these kits, I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, ah, nobody's going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was like, okay, well, I saw the
potential like this light bulb went off
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, we can bank all the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be breeding these amazing
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be able to save
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can clean this stuff and all,
you know, which is, and isn't true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not as easy as, you know,
I wanted to make it Bill Graham.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who got me excited about
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, okay, this dude does tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sells these home kits and all this
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I went to DJ short and I was,
I sat down to, uh, next to him at a cup
[SPEAKER_02]: and I looked over him and we're talking
about tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like tissue culture, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, they've been doing tissue
culture for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, what they do is they,
his tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, you take a cut and you
take it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it out every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let it go, get the vibration of the
earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let it grow as fast as it possibly can
with the most vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take a cutting and that is
your tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: He shit on the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me for tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh man, he ruined it in the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a field method of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very smart, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very, you know, it's very sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't really need that many seasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the way I was presented to it was,
um, uh, Dr. Kenobi, you know, online,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're a guy, Dr. Kenobi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and, uh, he used to, uh, garden up in
carpenteria and, uh, he stabled all of my
[SPEAKER_04]: legacy genetics for me for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, he told me that the way a good
way to do it is, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the summertime when you grow moms and
they all grow over six feet tall,
[SPEAKER_04]: very easily, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got plants that now are growing
multiple inches a day.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you do is you just simply,
you grow a plant over six feet tall is
[SPEAKER_04]: what he said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grow a plant over six feet tall,
and then you take a clone from the top of
[SPEAKER_04]: that, of the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that if you do that a couple of times,
and then you grow that mother out,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it out in the sun, let it grow to
five, six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's doing two inches a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the top off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time you do, I don't know whether
you said two or three times, by the time
[SPEAKER_04]: you do that two or three times,
you've cleaned the genetic pool because
[SPEAKER_04]: it, it's growing so fast that it doesn't
have enough time to pass the systemic
[SPEAKER_04]: pathogen or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if it's in the vascular and you're
able to get past that, which is like kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of where Meristem tissue culture is at,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're outgrowing these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can outgrow a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you can outgrow everything,
but you can outgrow a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that they've been doing that
for 30, 40 years, probably maybe longer
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably with other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I, you know, I just, you know,
it, you see it used, we, we coined a term
[SPEAKER_04]: for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People started calling it genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no such thing as genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it actually is, is it's more like
passing around STDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the early days, nobody had a good
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody in the, in the winter time,
I'd grow in the attic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'd be no snow on my roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the summertime I'd grow in the
basement and there was mold and dirt and
[SPEAKER_04]: dust.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd give clones to people and people
would run barns.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you're doing is you're passing
around every pathogen, every anti positive
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you clone susceptible plants and
those plants become more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you know, and another thing that I
experienced recently is morphing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years ago, I wouldn't have believed
that you can, I can give my strawberry
[SPEAKER_04]: cough or my grape ape to somebody and they
grow it in a style that is so far from the
[SPEAKER_04]: way I treated the plants that in a few
generations I got the strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew it out and it was strawberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every bud I smoked, whether it was
this big or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was strawberry cough.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looked different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it grew these long thin buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had morphed now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also, it didn't smell as good and
didn't have as much resin on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was because she was growing with
synthetic newts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was growing under low light
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was cloning weak moms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that all added up to a morphing into a
different plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think over time, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over time you look at, so OG Kush that
went, the ghost OG and the Josh DOG,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had them labeled as these two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got them from two different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: One came from up in Washington and the
other came from my buddy in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you grow them side by side and they
were different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look different plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoked them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could tell they were related,
but you'd probably say, oh, it's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: same bud for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially the finished product was a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: One definitely yielded more with bigger
buds and one was smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they take these different paths in
life and whether it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: epigenetics or whatever you want to call
it, I would say that it's going through
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, all these things happen to
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a living thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So as it goes through, you're passing them
along and nobody had ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does tissue culture clean that
completely?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I know that once my
stuff was passed along, I made an
[SPEAKER_04]: agreement with Dark Heart Nursery a few
seasons ago and they were really nice to
[SPEAKER_04]: take on a couple of my actual cultivars,
along with the strawberry cough and the
[SPEAKER_04]: grape ape, which I carry, but you know,
they're not mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they put it all through their lab and
none of it had hoplite and virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so this is what's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gave them the strawberry cough that I
got back from Mama Funk.
[SPEAKER_04]: She started a clone company.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I gave it to her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also, see people are like,
you don't have the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I've given it to a hundred good
friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so easy to get back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a call to my buddy, to my German
friend in New York, and I have him mail it
[SPEAKER_04]: back to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm getting it back from the same
fucking guy I gave it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I gave them both to Dark Heart and
they both tested the same, but they grew
[SPEAKER_04]: differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I chucked the one that I got back
from Mama Funk and I kept the one and I
[SPEAKER_04]: still give it out to this day and it's the
big wide leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even grow three or four feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But genetically it could be identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were genetically identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't grow the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had been morphed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Systemic bacteria, there's all these
things in the plant as it grows and
[SPEAKER_02]: progresses through life and all these
things happen to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stress it out, you beat it up or one
person does and the other person doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whether it's intentional or
unintentional, we've been bioengineering
[SPEAKER_04]: plants since we started agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people have seen pictures of the first
corn plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look anything like corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was nothing but plant selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can select, what if we don't
select, like you said, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What if we don't select?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all kinds of things,
representations out there that are
[SPEAKER_04]: accidental.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them, as in strawberry cough
turns out to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of accidental stuff out
there that some people take credit for or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but even bag seeds, lots of bag
seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the best stuff that's come
down, we're talking bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old Grateful Dead story about the chem
91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the chem came from, good old chem
father.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, speaking of chem, I got that sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met up with this guy, Dave Budolero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I sometimes think maybe my mind's
playing tricks on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I remember it different than how it
really was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour diesel was like that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen all these samples over the
last year because I talk about it on my
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time I go to an event,
someone has a bag of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had AJ on, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've never had AJ?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not yet had AJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will get AJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what AJ stands for, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Asshole Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need to get AJ on it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd seen a bunch of samples of sour
and they were all real gassy and they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have what I consider sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my nose, in my mind, I'm going,
something's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's my mind that's playing tricks
on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was, it looked like sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled sourish with a really heavy
chemi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smell, but it didn't have that,
that, that citrus.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fruit behind the pine root.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fruit behind the pine.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, you know, you didn't even have to
squeeze nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd open the bag and it would punch you
in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this guy, Dave comes up to me,
he's really got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about doing a drop in
metric with it because he has 10 pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to share it with the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could just buy the 10 pounds and give
them out to everybody, I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like that's something we could
do a metric drop with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stand behind his flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to see it again, it reminds me now I'm
like, okay, cat piss is the real,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember cat piss too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen a whole bunch of that,
but that sour special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I think there's so many things
that I haven't seen in years, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: locked into your, your brain, into your
palette.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you were talking about flavors and
all those important things, I started
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about the whole controversial
issue, issue about synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you want it, you want,
you want to make people mad?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to get information out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the truth is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, unfortunately we do live in a
world where truth is subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people get hurt feelings quite often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to not be afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is subjective.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no undeniable truths anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I have an innate sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up with a vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, we didn't use miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you guys use?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just natural amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just watered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't need a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got it from the earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't need to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had fertile soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't add very much to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just tilled it over every year and you
planted and the shit grew and it was
[SPEAKER_04]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, uh, you know, I,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it has something to do with the
skepticism over the certification of
[SPEAKER_04]: organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that has something to do it because
people are so skeptical these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have to analyze all
information before I make my decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because you don't understand,
understand that there are undeniable
[SPEAKER_04]: truths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you, they don't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all muddied.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all muddied.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all muddied.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all intentional and unintentional.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the conspiracy industrial
complex is just as evil as the military
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial complex and the pharmaceutical
industrial complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all prey on the impressionable and
the weak and you know, they prey on us
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and social media has made it very
easy to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no excuse though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No excuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no excuse for this, but yeah,
we live in a very strange time to say the
[SPEAKER_04]: least.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know, food, you know,
you'll get people to agree with you that
[SPEAKER_04]: when you read a food label, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If it has words that you can't pronounce
on it, you don't need to know what they
[SPEAKER_04]: are, but you probably like, that's not
good for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably don't want to be consuming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how come you can live with the fact
that you're okay with feeding your plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you're going to put in your body and
you read the label and it has those same
[SPEAKER_04]: words that you can't pronounce and you
don't know what they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, now look, I'm not taking away
your right to do whatever the fuck you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: To grow whatever, I don't fucking care,
but don't debate me that those chemicals
[SPEAKER_04]: equate to the lack of them, to the absence
of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all, you know, it doesn't have
to be vegan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, your name is synonymous with
veganic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as much as strawberry coffee,
if I hear the word veganic, you pioneered
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, as much as money is not my
motivation, I do think it's for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what I thought when I
stumbled on veganics, because I had some
[SPEAKER_04]: friends that were total crunchy hippies
and he was a vegan and he grew veganically
[SPEAKER_04]: and he comes to my house one day and he
says, man, you know, uh, Canada just came
[SPEAKER_04]: out with this veganic soil and they had
this bio Tara plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was only available for a couple of
years because it had three different types
[SPEAKER_04]: of bark, three different types of sphagnum
and each one of those six components were
[SPEAKER_04]: milled to five different consistencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was its own aeration.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could never compare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one of those materials became
illegal to import into the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they stopped selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, long story short, um,
uh, I tried it and at the time I was using
[SPEAKER_04]: cannon nutrients, which are veganic.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no animal byproducts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no animal products and it's also
organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, that very first crop that I,
that didn't have, that it wasn't loaded
[SPEAKER_04]: with, uh, bat guano and bird guano and
emulsion fish, fish emulsion, and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, all the good stuff, well balanced
was the cleanest weed that I'd ever smoked
[SPEAKER_04]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I didn't know was it's all about
heavy metal content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I learned, um,
when I actually created vegan matrix and I
[SPEAKER_04]: sent in our first lab sample of the first
weed that, well, it wasn't the first weed
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew with, but it was the one to get the
certs that we were going to publish for
[SPEAKER_04]: the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we sent the weed into a lab,
uh, to do metal, heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, guy called me up and he's like,
Kyle, you're not going to believe this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tests came back zeros and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right away I went, there's no such
thing as zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, we had to recalibrate the machine
from parts per million to parts per
[SPEAKER_04]: billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And your stuff comes in at two to 600
parts per billion of arsenic, cadmium,
[SPEAKER_04]: mercury, and lead.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a thousand times less than any PPM
rating, even if it's 0.1 or 0.01 or 0.00
[SPEAKER_04]: something parts per million, which is all
organic weed is in the parts per million.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best weed still tests and that's
perfectly legal, but I found a way to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: weed that produced produce that had only
parts in perceptible amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, I wanted to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day I had a friend in my house,
um, Billy Blackburn, he created the easy
[SPEAKER_04]: clone machine and they were on their way
down to a show and he stopped at my house
[SPEAKER_04]: with this whole crew and he said,
man, I'm so fucking stone, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your weed is so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should make your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, it clicked and I was like,
I, and I was like, I need to share this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was my motivation was to put
something in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was clean, you know, and I got all
wrapped up in people thinking,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the best and I'm better than
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got pigeonholed into this fucking
thing and I'm glad to be free of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I grow with minimal animal
by-products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I use a really amazing new,
so I had to find a new nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: My, my, my nutrient company went under
about three years ago after eight years of
[SPEAKER_04]: solid business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, so I had to find a new nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I pretty much use them all.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, except for the newest versions of
companies that have already been out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of those are actually better than
they used to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's salts are not what salts used to
be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the heavy metals are much lower and
they're produced at a much higher quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, uh, so I use organics alive now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is truly a new tech in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When he designed it, he had to create,
he had to do the white papers and create a
[SPEAKER_04]: new category of fertilizers before the
California department of agriculture would
[SPEAKER_04]: license it and allow him to sell it as a
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that category is microbial
fermentation by-product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the derived from that's
the only ingredient, microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: fermentation by-product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't simplify that for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will tell you that it contains zero
salts and zero heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went from low salts and low heavy
metals to zero salts and zero heavy
[SPEAKER_04]: metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty happy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's funny because some flower gets you
tight behind the eyes where it feels like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pulling your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others where it's like narcotic and then
you have the stimulants that lean on the
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa side, the super silver hazes,
you know, they have the Colombian in them
[SPEAKER_02]: or what, whatever it is, you know,
these stimulate or African stimulants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like, uh, feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inputs determine outputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing with our bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how great you feel if you eat
really good for a week or so, and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: how bad you feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing for your plants,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that effect is because it's clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes people say, you know,
they get flavors off of strains that they
[SPEAKER_04]: never had because the heavy metals,
now they mask terpenes and they raise the
[SPEAKER_04]: combustion temperature of the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as my cherry cools and it wants to
extinguish, the higher the heavy metal
[SPEAKER_04]: level counts in there, the earlier it's
going to extinguish and you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: need to relight it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My joints, usually once you light it,
I can talk for three to five minutes and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's still lit because it just keeps
getting cooler and cooler and cooler and
[SPEAKER_04]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it hasn't reached the combustion
temperature because it doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_04]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleanliness is every cleanliness and
effect is everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then taste smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it right after that is smoke
ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to, you want to be able to
want to pick it up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the jars get empty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the test, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The jars empty.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do the jar test here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're baked right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like I'm baked, but we smoked all
day yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I smoked a lot yesterday to wear,
I had to wear sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to mention that we just spent two
days at the 20th annual Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm a little froggy in the
throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a lot of interviews there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, it's such a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really good event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was a lot of skepticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going into the event from a lot of people
were like, it's going to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going from hippie to hip hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, cause I'm from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a local in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, people were like, is everyone's car
windows going to get broken in?
[SPEAKER_02]: No car windows got broken in the first
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about Sunday, but I know the
first day there was no windows broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the city really embraced the
event, which I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fact that the Oakland city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people from Oakland and you know,
the people that count were like welcoming
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like so many of us showed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people from the
industry, you know, you never know how
[SPEAKER_02]: events are going to be, but I try to be as
optimistic as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping Tim Blake made the right
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, he did make the right
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was much smaller, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was more intimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like those events are great and
it's, it's building blocks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the building block for what's
to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do this again next year and let's
do it a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the year after that and a little
bigger than that and turn it into another
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know what one of the keys was?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was easy access to the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though it was an indoor event,
that easy access to outdoors, just a few
[SPEAKER_04]: steps away or a minute walk or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want you smoking on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there was a guy flashing his
badge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I caught a couple of cops that caught me
as, cause I was so comfortable walking
[SPEAKER_04]: around with my bowl the whole time that I
would walk off property.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd go to check the van or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go somewhere and then I'd hit the
bowl and then I'd look up and there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: sheriff standing on the corner and he's,
nobody even, they didn't even want to look
[SPEAKER_04]: at me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland is pretty mellow and the police
that were there were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, cause they didn't
want you smoking inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a guy, I got two strikes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got warned more than two times for
smoking the whole podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Brian from Vital got a badge
flashed at him and a gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy was like, dude, you're on your
third warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, but I would say that the,
you know, the energy there was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people there, everyone was good times,
good vibes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I popped a tear and you know, once or
twice, I just, you know, just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's a lot of friction in any
industry, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is, I don't know if like
when beer barons fight, if they actually
[SPEAKER_04]: end up in the same room, partying with
each other or, you know, people from the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they fight and then they make
up, but they don't end up in the same room
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about it and really getting over
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our culture does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of what this event was
good for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what all these events do is I
saw people that I work with, like people
[SPEAKER_04]: from high times that I hadn't seen in a
decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw four generations of high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I finally got to spend some personal
time with Tim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got to spend some personal time
with Steve D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so is Tim and that was priceless.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to spend more personal time with Ed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was priceless.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, yeah, man, I, we interviewed
so many, every, every, oh, Josh,
[SPEAKER_04]: we just did so many people that,
and it was work and I got tired at the end
[SPEAKER_04]: of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, if I could, if I would do that
once a month, and then I wouldn't have to
[SPEAKER_04]: work for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, you just need a new magazine to
pick you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, I mean, there's so many
events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every month there's two or three events
somewhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing events.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just came from Barcelona from the
Spanavis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I love, that's my event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go there every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always have a booth with either myself
or with, you know, Greenhouse has been for
[SPEAKER_02]: the last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is great when you get to
experience a non-American culture and see
[SPEAKER_04]: how people embrace the cannabis culture
and they're inquisitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's different because they all,
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all don't know somebody who smokes
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, and not everybody even
has an opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes you get to just expose
yourself as an emissary and that feels
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fresh, Oh, you do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Spanavis is one of those amazing
things where you get people from all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the world coming together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see my friends from every continent
that has people on it, except for
[SPEAKER_02]: Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very centralized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are looking forward to go to
that event and talking about culture,
[SPEAKER_02]: going out to dinner, eating together,
going to the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of genetics are sold there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell seeds there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's always a good time and I
just can't wait for the next year every
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a bad Spanavis experience
ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a bad Emerald Cup
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, me neither.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've had a bad High Times Cup
experience, meaning it wasn't so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a few High Times, you know,
where they just never had a bad Emerald
[SPEAKER_04]: Cup experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought I was going to miss Sonoma
more than I did, but Oakland was okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought the vibe is what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought the vibe and there are so many
OGs there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, if the OGs weren't there,
it wouldn't have been the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All the guys from back in, I mean,
I've been seeing these people at events
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, Swami and Keith and Dale
Geringer and Dale Jones, Dale Sky Jones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I mean, it was,
it was a cornucopia of- And the old High
[SPEAKER_02]: Times staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Craig Coffey and, you know,
Melissa and Bobby Black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby and April were there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got Ellen.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like the new High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was she there?
[SPEAKER_02]: She was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to catch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So her and I keep on missing each other at
events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were, we've been at the same event
multiple times and she has her book out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my book out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were finally able to like talk for a
little bit, which is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And seeing these- That would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love to get her impressions on how High
Times is getting things done because it
[SPEAKER_04]: was hard back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were a bunch of, everybody
was a bunch of stoners, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had my first panic attack that I,
I don't have them regularly, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: even know what one was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, after deadline, deadline,
deadline, all of a sudden like deadline is
[SPEAKER_04]: like six days away and you, you haven't
started your work yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had my, I was like, I'm going home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even shut off my computer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, well, I didn't even tell him I was
leaving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, this is a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and yeah, it was, it was- It would
have been great to have Malcolm there
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's Malcolm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Malcolm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Malcolm, Mr. Dan Skye.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan Skye.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, he's a blast.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's always, you know, He was at my,
he, he photographed my wedding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got married in Jamaica at the first High
Times Jamaican Cup and Rick Cusick married
[SPEAKER_04]: us.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a minister of the church of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rules of the church of light are
you have to drink water and not be a dick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he officiated our wedding and all
seven tribes of Rastafari were there
[SPEAKER_04]: because High Times had just brought them
all together for the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the prime minister, Mark Goulding was
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, so there was like 20 people we
knew at our wedding and there was 300
[SPEAKER_04]: people that we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they broadcast it live over
Jamaican radio, the Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my wife wasn't Mrs. Orenstein.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was Mrs. Kushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fucking crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica is an amazing place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't even meant he photographed our
wedding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some amazing photographs that
Malcolm took.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were featured in High Times,
he flew in, stayed at my house for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days back in 2012, I believe it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took him on tours of grows back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really trapped still, believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2012 is only like 12 years ago,
but it was a lifetime ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lifetime ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we move at like dog years,
seven years to every one in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're all getting gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I shaved my beard, but if I grew a
beard, it would all be gray and it's gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, it's part of the whole
aging process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Hey, I, I, I'm proud to be here to be
alive, to be well, to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: plumbing all works and I can automobile
myself and I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I feel like gratitude is such an
important thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remembering where we came from as part of
gratitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter how much money you have or
what kind of problems you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can always live in gratitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's another takeaway.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to say choose to live in the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm going to assume something,
I'm going to assume something good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hit me with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I neither do you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how's your podcast going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it seems like you're all
over the place with guests and doing
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fell in with Homegrown Cannabis Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's almost 10 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, we've done just a hundred,
uh, thanks to, uh, my buddy, Matt,
[SPEAKER_04]: who actually goes by Nate Hammer or 20,
you know, and, uh, he's just, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been workhorses and hundreds,
if not thousands of hours of video,
[SPEAKER_04]: both entertainment and, uh, educational is
online at Homegrown Cannabis Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and then just recently,
I think maybe about a year ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: he had an idea for what was, is my third
podcast now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, Gua, we like to say, I Gua,
do you Gua?
[SPEAKER_04]: Stands for grow weed at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I am the ultimate home grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Advocate a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really it's kind of my last bastion of
the fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of people out there
fighting for legalization and I've fought
[SPEAKER_04]: for legalization and I have legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get into how legal it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so my last bastion is as we legalize
across the country, you must recognize the
[SPEAKER_04]: right of home growers, you know,
most places do as they go along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most places do, but I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arizona did not for a few years and then
they changed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for years, if you lived within 25 or 50
miles of a dispensary, you were required
[SPEAKER_04]: to buy your medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's wrong for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wrong for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've really just, you know,
I, I, I talk the talk and I walk the walk
[SPEAKER_04]: and I grow my own weed at home and I put
it up online and.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Matt's idea to create grow weed at
home with Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So luckily this was the greatest
opportunity because we brought the podcast
[SPEAKER_04]: to the Emerald cup and we did a dozen
interviews over two days and every
[SPEAKER_04]: interview was a hard hitter was just a
superstar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, from Ed Rosenthal,
Steve D'Angelo, Tim Blake, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew D'Angelo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then, and then, um, the Delicis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Delicis, I just got to meet this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, we, we, we went out last night
for a Peking duck.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all sat around the lazy Susan,
you know, and had Chinese food for an
[SPEAKER_04]: hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rich Delicis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the longest serving pot prisoner who
just got released.
[SPEAKER_02]: 32 calendar years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did 32 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 32 years of a 93 year sentence.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll forgive me if it wasn't that 90
number, but it was a 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was almost a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did 30 some years and, uh,
last prisoner project just got him out.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of their, another one of their
successes, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I just, I do want to say before I
finish this story that, um, please don't
[SPEAKER_04]: poo poo on last prisoner project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so I met the Delicis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, homegrown cannabis co is sponsoring a
movie about them and it's called Santa
[SPEAKER_04]: Marta goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's the strain that he pretty
much smuggled the most, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was the preeminent strain and,
um, and Matt Nate hammer, he's,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's making the film.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, all this wonderful stuff
he's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no doubt that it's going to be
absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just haven't quite, I think they were
going to do a documentary, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's evolving into a full on biopic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and man, just, I can't even get
into a good mood when I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: this, a man that lost 32 years of his
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think 37 total years, but he served
32 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting dizzy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm literally getting a little
bit, you know, so yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to, I got to interview both of
the Delicis and you know, that's just the,
[SPEAKER_04]: that kind of content is the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, my show is called grow weed at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a theme, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, not everybody that I talked
to grows weed at home or wants to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: weed at home, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean, we had Jim James, blue Jim
Belushi on.
[SPEAKER_04]: He grows weed at home and he grows weed at
home.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so we follow the theme,
but I also like to just, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's more, I want to embrace the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, having rich on the show,
uh, uncle Rick, and Rick both I've had
[SPEAKER_02]: them on multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great people, but that's to me,
that's what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I do this when I, it's a good,
you know, I think it's a, it's a good way
[SPEAKER_02]: to tell a story and to share the whole
picture of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there is no industry without
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the, that's the big,
beautiful thing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's, it's really sad that he did so
much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had Luke Scarmazzo and
together they've done over 50 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is longer than I've been alive and
did a dozen or a dime, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he's dead now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would have lived for at least another
10 years or 20 if he hadn't had to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through that bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just realize how good we've got it now
and stop, stop letting, letting the
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect be, uh, not letting things go
forward, you know, because nothing is ever
[SPEAKER_04]: fucking perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, sometimes you have to embrace
positive for positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: See the forest for the trees, you know,
baby steps are okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think that's another thing we
want to make leaps and bounds all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but sometimes it's just a small
step.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to grow one before you grow a,
before you go commercial, you got to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you, you got to do a lot of
things before you can say, I know it all
[SPEAKER_04]: not meaning I know it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But meaning like, I know enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, I could teach some others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's no, I mean, there's,
for me, it's like, I'm constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm every day I'm learning something new
or a learning something I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a great, great, uh,
atmosphere and, um, a platform,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, for, um, our industry needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: More platforms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's not just the growers and it's
not just the breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say just, what I mean is,
you know, you know, there are other people
[SPEAKER_04]: like the Dalises that if they didn't bring
in tons and tons of weed, I wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: been smoking weed at 12 years old,
being able to get it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for the droughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had droughts every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year there was a drought month or
two.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to go on a clean break.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was brow weed maybe
sometimes, but I wasn't really big on
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking the stuff that gave me headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I started smoking the good stuff,
I did not want to go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Never look back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, you know, it's also,
you know, it's also in an odd way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's some of the people,
you know, like I mentioned, Billy
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackburn early who created the first
commercial cloner for the easy clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, it's, it's these,
all these tech guys that we have to thank
[SPEAKER_04]: too in the early days that created the,
you know, they, they went through
[SPEAKER_04]: operation green merchant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember the guys that lost their
inventories and lost their livelihoods?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seagull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydrofarm went through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of personal people because the
hydrofarm stock got taken and they
[SPEAKER_04]: couldn't pay back the, you know,
the inventory they'd taken in from all
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturers, light manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember back in the day, the
innovations, they were trying to sell us
[SPEAKER_04]: water-cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, they were trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Agnetics still makes water-cooled
lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that it's an advancement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought it home and I hooked it up once
with a, with a, I'm like, I shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: building this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't be doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have a plumber in doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's these, it's all of
these advancements that we have to thank,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the electricians that,
you know, some people are mad that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they charge higher prices when
they know that they're installing it at a
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But man, back in the day, when I had
somebody to be thankful for that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that could hook up the voltage I
needed and he wasn't going to tell
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was happy to give him an extra 500
bucks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all of that, you know, I still,
I still have his name in my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Henry, you know, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, back in the day, we had to do it
all now with places like this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a great team luckily.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a, this is a, you know,
look, you've created a James loud is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a, is a persona, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and, and that takes work because
James loud is so much more than one
[SPEAKER_02]: person, even though it's, it's a name.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I mean is when you,
when you, when you, if you break it down
[SPEAKER_04]: about how much work it took before you
felt comfortable putting up a neon sign
[SPEAKER_04]: with your name on it, you had so many
people help get you there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hadn't met people, or if you've met
a few more people who stabbed you in the
[SPEAKER_04]: back, or didn't lead you the right way,
you might not be here either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: The journey has been wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to appreciate the journey,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I mean, I was very fortunate to
get good weed at a young age and fall in
[SPEAKER_02]: love with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, I come from New York
and New York, we got great drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing good drugs when I was far too
young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, grateful dead is like from the Bay
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had access to pretty much anything
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if you had the chance to go back to
your younger self and give them one piece
[SPEAKER_02]: of advice, what would that advice be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been asked or answered this
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what popped into my head just
shows my fucking priorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be shy in front of women.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I used to use this as a,
uh, one of my speeches, like I've given so
[SPEAKER_04]: many at normal conferences at hemp fest
and all these bashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get up and you got to say
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one time I used to say to people,
you know, don't be afraid of the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't like, don't shy away from the cops.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you've got to do is when you see a
cop on the corner, standing there,
[SPEAKER_04]: doing his thing, make eye contact with
them and say, hi officer, how are you
[SPEAKER_04]: doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that does is it makes you getting
used to, um, having an interaction with
[SPEAKER_04]: the cops so that the next time that you're
walking around, you got a backpack full of
[SPEAKER_04]: weed, like I do, and you make eye contact
with a cop instead of looking away,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you'd be natural to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll go, hi officer, how was your day?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he'll go very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll walk along.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that may or may not have a big
implication, but so I used to say,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just like talking to women.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you gotta get, you just gotta
get used to it, you know, and once you get
[SPEAKER_04]: used to it, you know, that's the thing
when you can make eye contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make eye contact with that girl that you
think is prettier that you want to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you make that eye contact and you
don't look away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the one thing that I would tell my
younger self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an original answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for coming on the
podcast today, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great having you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great seeing you at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we got to do this again soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people want to find out more about Kyle
Cushman, where should they go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first and foremost, I'm like
Homegrown Cannabis Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean that to sell the seeds,
because that's what they do is sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just mean there's so much educational
content there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never really had a crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't make, do that stuff on my own.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't until I met Homegrown and they
hired me to be a spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, we got, there's just super cropping
videos and seed, how to, everything from
[SPEAKER_04]: how to plant the seed to how to water it,
to how to make your first nutrients to
[SPEAKER_04]: how, you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see me live, we do a weekly
podcast and it's all over everything on
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube and Spotify and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Grow Weed at Home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you want to connect with me
live.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Kyle Cushman 420 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
