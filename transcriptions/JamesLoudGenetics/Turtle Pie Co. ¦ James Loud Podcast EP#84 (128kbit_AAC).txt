[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we have Turtle from Turtle Pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about this for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have run with the same group of
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not really known each other for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw you cheffing at the birthday
party, I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: How close are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fact that we're on the show and
we're getting to know more about each
[SPEAKER_02]: other is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like it's long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've known about Turtle Pie for quite
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turtle Magnum, it made the circuit a while
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was super popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it was a hype strain for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the thing to have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Magnum Turtle definitely had its little
spotlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was challenged heavily by the
LCGs, because it looked the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it definitely had its own terpene
profile, its own taste to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it was so great, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's exactly why it was so
great, because it wasn't just LCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just no LCG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looked similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no LCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it had a similar look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpene profile was completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anecdotally, do you remember Cherry Pie?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any terpene profile similarity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or similarities between Magnum Turtle and
Cherry Pie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the first time I smelled it,
the only thing that came, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe this is what Cherry Pie is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I haven't seen Cherry Pie since
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry Pie was straight anise,
I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say Cherry Pie was like anise gas,
like a GDP, with more cherry.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I remember Cherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cherry Pie hermed a little bit when
you grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cherry Pie was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that lost most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lost momentum because it had intersex
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people didn't want shit that hermed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But GDP was the real, real back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherry Pie was, if you thought about
opening the door with the lights off,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was going to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Cherry Pie was special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came out of the GDP era and was
the new GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it checked those boxes for those
people that really liked GDP, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I liked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the beginning of the cookies
era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the beginning of like,
back then, you had Jack Terps,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had Sour and OG Terps, and you had
Perp Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get this stuff called Orange
Crush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had your citrus Terps too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there wasn't a ton of stuff outside
that box that was readily available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Cherry Pie came along,
I was like, oh, wow, this thing tastes way
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an early za.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-candy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best I've ever smoked,
funny, an old friend of mine grew it in
[SPEAKER_02]: his backyard in like a half a whiskey
barrel or some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it didn't herm at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just the fire's outdoor I've
ever smoked growing in Noy Valley in early
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was like, you know, I mean,
I feel like cookies was its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a sweeter, something that
definitely tied into the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wildlife was around back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super excited about the,
I have not seen the Y since 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to get it from my buddy Goldmember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, that fucking wildlife was down
to the roach, tasted just as intense as
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the, you know, before Skittles,
that was the candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was floral too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super floral, super sweet,
really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of those unobtainable strains
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was lucky to find an eighth every
once in a while or someone would part with
[SPEAKER_02]: one because it was like, nah, I only got a
zip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, I'll give you an eighth
because I'm going to keep the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I definitely, it was definitely had
his time in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember paying 60 bucks an eighth that
we could get it straight up 60 bucks an
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not 3.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we actually got 3.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be a little wet, but you know,
it was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, can't wait to sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to wait for it to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were so excited about certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would buy it wet and you would lose a
little bit of weight, but if you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: get it wet, you wouldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how'd you get your start in cannabis or
when did you start?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started, I was seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to private school as a youngster,
first through sixth grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis was something that my dad and
his friends did.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was always a tray of cookies at the
Christmas events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, these aren't for the kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't eat these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't think anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were smoking doobies back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, black hash finger hash,
you know, whatever Nepalese traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went to public school and after a
couple of months, after coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: private school or, you know, 200 kids to
go into public school in the seventh
[SPEAKER_02]: grade, like a thousand kids or whatever,
I find myself in a group of kids and they
[SPEAKER_02]: all smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before long I'm like, oh, you know,
my dad's got some of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, oh yeah, fucking bring to school
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we'd run out of our parents'
weed that we were boosting, we'd walk a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of blocks down to Dolores Park and
get an Ocho from the dudes in Dolores
[SPEAKER_02]: Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have a little flap of grass they'd
pull up with a bunch of tinfoil bindles of
[SPEAKER_02]: a straight brown burnt Mexican brown weed,
fucking seeds and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 60% seeds, 40% weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we called them Ocho's because
we didn't want to give them 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only giving you eight for all them
damn seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I had it, you know, because it
kind of just took off for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fit, you know, my dad grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't really introduce me to it until
I introduced him to me doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't like, he was like,
all right, it's time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never shared the family business
with me until way after the fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you got caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he beat my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I remember he left on Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to Hawaii one time and I was maybe
a freshman in high school and he left like
[SPEAKER_02]: an ounce of weed in his weed drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every day I took a little bit thinking
he wouldn't, he wouldn't notice,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the eighth turned into like less than
a half ounce or the ounce turned into less
[SPEAKER_02]: than a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, it didn't look like much was
missing because I was taking a bowl or two
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was always like, all right,
this has got to fucking stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you know, you're a freshman in
high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to be smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to stop stealing my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your own, which I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how this all started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a guy who'd sell actual ACE for 60
bucks and bought an eighth one day,
[SPEAKER_02]: broke down three dubs, sold them the next
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bought another eighth the day after that,
broke down three dubs, sold them the next
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I had a dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I saved the point five from
the, from the ACE.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for once, and then I just kept
reinvesting and, you know, kind of always,
[SPEAKER_02]: always liked being the plug to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely has his pitfalls being a plug,
plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You attract a lot of attention,
a lot of it good, a lot of it sinister,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of multi-intentioned people hang out
with the plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so learned a lot of hard, expensive
lessons, lost a lot of people I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: were friends that really weren't friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just hanging out with the plug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, I don't know
that I would change too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of the dumb decisions I've had,
decisions I made, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: who wouldn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really know who your friends are when
shit hits the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you go through hell,
when you, bad shit happens, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: really find out who your friends are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that I thought were my best friends
were my close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the people that actually came out
and they were there for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, those were my real friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only got a couple of flat tire rainy
day on the freeway friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got three, then you're probably in
good shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people got one if it's not their wife
or partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got more than that,
then you're obviously running shit the
[SPEAKER_02]: right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're running your life and you're making
sure everybody else is eating,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking care of everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not wrong about how you find out
where you are in their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be hold a certain position in
your life, but you don't really know where
[SPEAKER_02]: you hold, what position you hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really know where you're at in
their life until that day comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, oh, how did I not see
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bad times make you appreciate
the good times even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like you can't have the bad
without the good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's that contrast that really,
it shows you who you are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tough times that test you show you
what you're made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you have good times,
it allows you to appreciate those bad
[SPEAKER_00]: times even more because they give you that
contrast.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard the saying, you don't know
happiness if you don't know sadness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of chuckled it off at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, no, actually this is
really deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of coexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have one without the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just be happy all the time
because then you won't know what being
[SPEAKER_02]: happy is if you don't actually experience
the opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never been broke, you won't
really appreciate what it's like to have
[SPEAKER_00]: money and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got to be broke twice before
you really start to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're dumb and you trick it
all off and then you make it again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, I'm never going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really get it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to save every penny or I'm going
to invest it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you know that you can if you
have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing is then you don't
have the fear because I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, they move through life with fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can take that fear away,
you can just move and do things the right
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right way is so many different things,
but there is the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's version of the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how your version of the truth,
your version of how you look at things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all interpretation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I normal?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what your vision or version
of being normal is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem pretty normal to me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so it's perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then you grew up in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Born and raised in SF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For school, as I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Freshman year high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, senior year high school,
I started raving a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge in 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went through the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm class of 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 92 is when it started popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you hold on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the rave scene in California,
especially San Francisco was the
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was like the home base parties
in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like disco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it was gone, it was gone forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I considered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all kind of the SF scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you weren't beholden to hold it in SF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I went to Bonnie Doon several times
with the home bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom that was out in Antioch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was out past Antioch and Oakley.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some amazing parties out in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't like the majority of them I
went to in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday night, Tuesday night, Saturday.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the wickets I could sneak into it till
I was old enough to get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for me and all my friends,
we all rave together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was 19 and 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were all 21 and 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like I would be so butt hurt
when I couldn't get into a party.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promoted a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had even some parties I was able to
get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew the dude throwing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funky Technotribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were my boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Johnny Caron.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of my good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnny knows me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and I, he's a little bit younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were right there together with
Kevin and Jerry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Funky Technotribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parties were insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Bay Area is amazing for culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're all carrying on these
legacies for people who were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, can't write it without the Bay
Area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without California, Northern California,
it almost doesn't exist without that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California, their influence,
Humboldt, Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt is known all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might not even know what Humboldt is,
but they know it's in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know it's a place where the good weed
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the good weed came from,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can't be duplicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our climate can't be duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in an authentic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can duplicate stuff, but can you
duplicate it authentically?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to try to take a carbon
copy and put it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can grow amazing flower in other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere in the world that you have
someone that's super passionate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow good flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antarctica, you send some guys that are
super passionate down there, they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: good flower in Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In space, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that passion that drives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see him grow some weed in space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how far that is away,
but I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Space weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Elon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow some weed on SpaceX.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, AI grown flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: AI grown flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely hydroponic, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the future is bright,
you know, I think in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, our industry is challenged
in its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, going into recreational,
we've had our setbacks and our challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've seen a lot of people
fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good, some bad and a mix of
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics is kind of all over the place,
but we're still holding on to that gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, strains have decade blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, sour diesel was all
anybody wanted for the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or OG Kush, depending on which coast you
were on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The circles that we were in, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had some chem dogs, some sour diesel,
some OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were these exotics of its time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I still love good sour,
good OG, good chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem D grown, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually pumped because the Green Dog
team has been scouring their resources to
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with the diesel they grew up with
in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the posts I read the other day
from the cultivator Keegan, shout out Dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: Lord, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just the passion and the way he was
describing the flower of it being so
[SPEAKER_02]: reminiscent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could kind of see, I could see it
because it was still wet, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside was really bright green,
but light, light, bright green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a, like a lime that you almost peeled
some of the fucking skin off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was super light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it had these bright pink salmon
colored hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the inside was almost like white
and blinding yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's what old diesel
used to look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't been up to sack in a couple
of weeks, but I'm going to go up and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully get to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had access since rigging the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave from Budge Laro, he grows the real
sour and he gave me some oregano.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had, we've done a podcast with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been friends with them ever since and
amazing, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it made me think that really
there's probably only one sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we have the AJ sour and we
have the weasels diesel and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the sour that I remember,
it was just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was this one amazing open the
bag, punches you in the face with Terps
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not super chemmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely the gas on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has loud lime, citrus funk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you open it up and it's
unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, is like with certain things,
you smell enough times where it's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: you remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start wondering if your mind
is like playing tricks on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you just didn't remember it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is, is once you smell it,
you'll go, oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no other ones that I remember that
are quite like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've recently come across that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to smoke what we called nade,
BC weed, Canada weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shortened Canada or Canadian into nade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had what we called nade or we had
glue or glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't really too many other
variations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was, I don't remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our friend brought me some and I was
like, is this the fucking nade,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, it's whatever he's calling
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like looking at it and I'm like,
wait, I'm smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, like a fucking reaching back into
history, reaching back into the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 2024 version, you know,
grown differently to today's standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's an identical twin,
this is our mutually favorite genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second I smelled it, I was like,
oh, this is the one, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you remember it as?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the funny thing is I was so excited
when he gave it to me because it's so loud
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like the OG that punches you in
the face.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that OG gas that burns your nose,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not heavy on the pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Josh D and some of these other ones
have more of that earthy pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is like nose burning and it's
more on the sativa leaning, smaller buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: longer flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has that nose burning punch,
like the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you wouldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the most gas of anything out right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed it to a whole bunch of people
from New York and a whole bunch of people
[SPEAKER_00]: from Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, is the first thing
they're like, dude, that's creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their opinion was creepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember getting that in the Bay area as
OG or like we had an OG that was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, where it was like, what the fuck is
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see gassy OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian from Vital Soil hit me with some OG,
like an ounce of OG that was the real OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: like unmistake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had the cut for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was though- Shout out to Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Brian from Vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has it every time I see him,
he usually gives me a little bit and they
[SPEAKER_00]: do the infinity jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he has some friends that are
also he's working with that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that is the real cut of OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's different than the OG I
grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's feeling an effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Effect-wise, it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I get in my nasal, I get,
and I hate saying this because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to diminish it in any way,
but back then I get Gorilla Glue vibes off
[SPEAKER_02]: it to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla Glue was the shit for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was a really killer strain for a
light, you know, it did well for itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like I get like the merger of OG and
Gorilla Glue, not really a GMO kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stank, but like that pungent, that loud up
there in the level of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a similar structure to the glue
too, the way it fingers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely get what you're saying
with the structure and also just the
[SPEAKER_00]: loudness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the first thing like- Do you
have any?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, but our mutual friend is supposed
to be bringing some soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're in like week six right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a 10-weeker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's splitting it with you and I,
we get the tester lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so loud, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one where you don't see,
you don't get the same effect from gelatos
[SPEAKER_00]: or cookies or any of these things where
you open the bag and it burns your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like how sour would hit your face,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour is different, but also when you open
the bag and it punches you in the face
[SPEAKER_00]: with smell, with the aroma, it's just like
unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat piss is what started it for me,
where it had that nose burn, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: open the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to open the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would smell through bags, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guarantee you even today's
standards, the turplocks, like it would,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would go through turplocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat piss, I miss some good cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're from the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably remember good cat piss in
the nineties, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that's another one where-
Dude, if I knew what my dad was growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to cut you off, but like my dad
always grew, he only, he only grew green
[SPEAKER_02]: weed once and it was the fucking best shit
he ever grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the other ties and maxis that he
grew that he took care of and manicured
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and it was all fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like weed I've never seen since,
you know, see, you know, seeds that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if he went and where,
where they came from out of a lid back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as, as a freshman in high school,
that the strain you're talking about was
[SPEAKER_02]: for me was skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was like, you had to have seven
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to be in seven fold over sandwich
bags or a film canister when we used to
[SPEAKER_02]: have 35 millimeter, because if you didn't,
you get busted at school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would smell out of your backpack and
it'd be like a thumb size, bright green
[SPEAKER_02]: marble with one crown royal bag,
purple leaf just laying on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we moved from that disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people didn't want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that has a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so intense because we had skunk
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even call it skunk though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, it was green,
but it was extremely skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told the story on my podcast a few
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the strawberry because the
nugs were strawberry shaped, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the straight, you'd get three or four,
usually three nugs in a bag and each nug
[SPEAKER_00]: was, you know, like 1.2 grams or whatever,
but it was strawberry shaped and it was as
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky as anything I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never had stuff called the roadkill
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't until the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I've heard that name kind of being
thrown around, but like 90s, we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd heard the term skunk for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk or skunk one was basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk one was a sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like totally like the skunk that
I skunk one that I experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Michigan skunk too,
that was really good, but that was like on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sweeter side of the skunk and not on
like the nose burn side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember that stanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loud in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told on you for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a 10th of a gram, if you just had a
10th of a gram that accidentally fell in
[SPEAKER_00]: your pocket, you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would smell a whole room and you just
don't get stuff like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some stuff like Skittles doesn't even
really smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like candy, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 90% of the stuff that's out there
right now is a trip down through the gummy
[SPEAKER_02]: bear aisle, you know, or the high chew
aisle or whatever would insert whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit flavored ice cream, candy,
you know, combination you want to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it, but you know, for me it's like,
so I just did a breeding project myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did half of it for me and the other
half for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I'm going to like it all,
but like I made sure I hit some turtle pie
[SPEAKER_02]: with some stuff I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's time to catch turtle up,
give turtle bit a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, I still love it to this day
because the way it makes me feel,
[SPEAKER_02]: but other people don't like it because
it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll fire up a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll take a hit or two and be like,
I'm cool, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's just not my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they smoke Skittles all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Skittles is over here,
turtle pie is over here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No similarities in the way it makes you
feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely got, I'm super pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took, I didn't just mean to jump into
this right here, but like I'm chomping at
[SPEAKER_02]: the bit because I can't, I can't wait to
start popping these seeds and see what I
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend of mine, uh, shout out Adrian
Sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: He created Zetopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Zetopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't really notice
the difference than a regular LCG,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I get the Z twang in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're a smoker, I totally get in
the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's for me, I really dig the strain
for being in the, in the realm that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dig that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We worked together way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just, you know, Frisco do is
one of our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he ended up latching on with the
group or I don't know what he was a main
[SPEAKER_02]: part of a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the middle of two thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up developing the Zetopia and
we got reconnected.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, he was working, I believe with,
uh, jokes up and, uh, fire society and
[SPEAKER_02]: working with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I said something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I did a post like February is
love month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking to, you know, get my ladies
pregnant and hit me up like, yo,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yo, I did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the Obama.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's not easy to deal by runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm not, I hope I'm quoting him
correctly, but, uh, like no fucking way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all right, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, after a few unsuccessful breeding
projects, I tried to do, um, I just said,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some new genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get some new stuff pumping
through the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I did a little project in my
basement and I've got a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: seats to start rifling through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took six, uh, seven of my, my strains
and then one other strain was gifted to me
[SPEAKER_02]: by a friend and I just toast them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I got some, I got with the purple
sticky rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some I got with Zetopia and some I got
with, uh, belts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm pumped to see some of these
combos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got grits and jam combos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got strawberry melon combos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got prickly pear Sunday paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm super pumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my first intentional breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if becoming a breeder per se
is something like internally for my own
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like to turn, to make that external,
I'm probably not organized enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it seems it's still a great progression
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not trimming flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a completely different everything,
uh, from, I guess, from the day you flip
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights, you got to treat them
differently to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pumped to start popping beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pumped to get some new Jennings out
and, and see, the feedback, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a new strain now that a friend of
mine did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it hasn't released.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about to release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's purple sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm calling it original sin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's purple sticky rice time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got everything you want banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got everything you want from the
purple sticky rice, but then it's got that
[SPEAKER_02]: from the sure bangers got that banger from
the sure banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm super stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, every time I talk about weed,
it's all about the feeling for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like those weeds and make that,
that punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The turtles are sure bangers, the nade or
whatever, you know, those, those GMO,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way GMO makes you feel fucking
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is super strong too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the, the nade or the creepy or
whatever, whatever you're going to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so strong, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that stuff is like, it's not for the
faint of heart, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for the new smoker that wants to
see if they like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the guys who really smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all the old school guys that smell
are like, yeah, that's the one I want
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people with either too much anxiety
and they need less or people who,
[SPEAKER_02]: or if you get anxiety, hell easy,
it's not for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hold anxiety and you want less
smoke some turtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you get anxiety easy,
definitely stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause your heart will be beating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll hear your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear it in my ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got the food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also makes you eat like crazy,
but yeah, I'm pumped about the original
[SPEAKER_02]: sin because that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as soon as it came out, I'm like,
oh, I got something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this tastes so good and it has
the looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as it sinks in seven or eight
minutes after smoking, and it's just like
[SPEAKER_02]: big, heavy, warm coat laying on your
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, ah, this is the shit right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing some call of duty or a movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just fucking veg out for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be on the lookout for original sin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys are going to fucking like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got, it hits everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, and that's going to be coming in
the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got my packaging figured out and
that's what I forgot to bring the damn jar
[SPEAKER_02]: for the original sin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, I'm pumped off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to start popping six to
12 seeds at a time and see what I can get
[SPEAKER_02]: and just be, you know, just do some fact
finding and see, see how some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics laid out and where I'm going to
end up with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm in the right place to talk
seeds all day off camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the thing I like about someone like
yourself, who's going into breeding is you
[SPEAKER_00]: already know what you're looking for as
far as quality, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, if you just start growing and
then you're in like a year or six,
[SPEAKER_00]: six months to a year and you're like,
I want to start breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like you have enough data
points collected over the period of your
[SPEAKER_00]: life to really go, you know, you might
say, this is what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a huge collection of
things that you've tried it and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go, okay, 80% of stuff I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way this makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this, the way this tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these traits and you can start time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You start listing these boxes that have to
be checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, as you have experienced,
that's when you really should go into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it's, it's a great way to
prevent yourself from getting bored with
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing for one thing, but also you
have this knowledge that you can pass down
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can share with the world through
your breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's 15 jobs you should have
before you're fucking breeding from,
[SPEAKER_02]: from building a room or, or watching a
room being built to learning how to line
[SPEAKER_02]: the trays or set your trays up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And run, run feed to de-leafing,
to harvesting, to trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those things come away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe you get to learn how to make
the batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe curing and drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a huge one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like learning how to dry and cure
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch every day, but it's still on
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to, unless I'm gone,
you're not doing that until I'm confident
[SPEAKER_02]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the hardest parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ruin all your work in one fucking
day that you spent three months doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow it and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go to, or they don't flush
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, they don't do that
last week or that last two weeks or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you flush for, but they screw
that part up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the drawing and the curing,
they just major fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have some booth,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And booth that should have been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a good starting point with the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you start with good genetics,
you have your room set up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dial it in and you go all that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, keep it simple until you
actually learn what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I would, an early
mistake, I made, and maybe you did is I
[SPEAKER_02]: had two or three other people who were
really good growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd ask them all the same fucking
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would take some of what he said and
some of what he said and some of what he
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the worst fucking idea because then
you don't know what's actually working and
[SPEAKER_02]: not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to listen to this dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll take his advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that doesn't work out after three
harvests, then I'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for whatever reason, I'll take the
one problem or two problems over to this
[SPEAKER_02]: dude and see if he can help me square them
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then trial and error, but cannabis is
a fucked up business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a lot of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_02]: One lost harvest might mean lost rent,
you know, especially if that's how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a bad Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a Christmas with no presents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be, yeah, you can't afford
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas was always hard on the weed
game, unless you saved money from
[SPEAKER_02]: summertime because no one was spending
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, don't you want to buy weed
for Christmas and give quarters away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the fuck wants an album?
[SPEAKER_02]: They want a quarter of this OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best Christmas gift of all time,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Christmas money was hard to make
October to January.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was when it was flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we had floods and we had droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of pull.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was up in waves and you know,
the summer it'd be hard to get stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't even understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was times where you couldn't get
weed to save your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a kid, you know, I was like,
you know, not kid kid, even in 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: 19, it was like, we might be able to get
some brown weed, but nobody wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke brown weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would rather not smoke at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was younger, I was like,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a point where I'm like,
I'm not smoking that stuff because it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives me headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you really get a taste for the
good stuff and you've smoked it long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, you just can't, you can't do the
bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I think I've smoked brown
weed like three times since I started
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking green weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once was in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once was, I let my buddy convince me that
his brain was phenomenal because it was
[SPEAKER_02]: green, but it was brown weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm paying for, for being brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good, but it's like, once you fly
first class, you don't try to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experiencing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you know,
it is what it is, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we live in this amazing world where we
have access to a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, the access that you have and the
access that I have, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get to smoke the really good stuff,
but not everybody, I always have to remind
[SPEAKER_00]: myself this, not everybody gets to smoke
like we smoke or experience, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it doesn't matter whether it's
extract, we can smoke pens or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't really get to experience
stuff on that level because that's the 1%,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, it's just like with money and
everything else, most people don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a reason it's the 1% and
not the 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely know the groups of weed I
smoke with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking the, if not the best tide for
the best weed around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, you can't really,
that 1% area and it kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 50, almost 51.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking weed, you know,
80% of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, I don't have space in my
lungs for shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, and I, it comes off totally weed
snobby and it might be a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would prefer you step your game up
and get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people want to hand me their joints
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, with COVID and being sick,
like I'm like, I'm getting to the point
[SPEAKER_02]: now where I'll like go to an event and
light a joint can be like, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hit your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give you bro hug, give you dapp,
but I don't want to hit your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really want you to hit mine
because I don't know what you're giving
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it was taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know who grew and rolled, whatever's in
my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know their standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then, nor do I want to swap spit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I would always get sick coming over
from Emerald Cup or any, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cup cough, all these, all these events,
Amsterdam high times cups, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things you would get the cup cough,
you know, cause everybody's sharing joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and they got germs coming in from all
around the world and we're all mixing it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, especially I didn't think about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I thought about like,
I got to get my passport taken care of
[SPEAKER_02]: because I want to go to Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have to go to Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Germany has to be on the radar
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it right after?
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany is in June.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Spanibus is in March.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I get, and then there's 420 in
between.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a busy three months right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the industry for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Spanibus is the one you got to go to
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mutual friends are all going to
Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this year we're doing a big,
every year is big.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I have FOMO on IG and I'm watching
everyone, I know they're fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, why have I not gone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a family man first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife works her ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a full-time job taking care of my
dog, my two cats and my daughter
[SPEAKER_02]: completely for a week and a half is a huge
stress on her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out, babe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, there's part of me that's
like, I can't fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at the same time, I'm like,
look, you don't want to live in this house
[SPEAKER_02]: forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to do some of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just work it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where the big deal happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the big meetings happen at Spanibus,
at MJBiz, at these bigger events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are where you bond with other guys
in the industry too that are on your
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, my wife's very supportive of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's my business partner and my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she does a lot of the fucking hard
stuff so that I can do the stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a team effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife is so busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't help me with my job,
but I got my two team members and without
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I'm like, what's the address for
today's event again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't find it in my emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, boomer, I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Lee and John Henry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are clutch and come through for
me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to give people their respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a very small group of people who
help me be turtle pie and allow me to be
[SPEAKER_02]: turtle pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sack craft team, my personal team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, do you know Barney?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know of Barney?
[SPEAKER_02]: Barney has a green dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Formerly Barney has the blueprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know blueprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, blueprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Jordan's another homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Barney is, he's like a weed celebrity
without a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody in SoCal knows who the fuck
he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he represents our brands down in the
Southern California area.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the most enthusiasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude is just fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the team, like I said, my team,
the green dog team and him and a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: other tight family members.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to leave anybody out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do this shit without you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so much fucking fun doing it with
y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for all being fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing up to work, motivating me to do
more every day because I can get lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get complacent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been excited about anything
really except for the new strains that I
[SPEAKER_02]: drop and the seed, like this new seed
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that because it's new
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given the pollen, but I got my
little paint rushes out and went in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and dusted each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't grown in years because other
people have been doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to grow a harvest again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know why I fucked up at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I decide to do it again,
I won't make that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: With seeds, for me, I go a lot longer than
I would if I harvest something a day or 63
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower, I go an extra month because I
want the darkest, best looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot more work and you got to
keep them as healthy and happy as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk on air, off air about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like a longer recipe because I got a
bunch of great seeds, but I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_02]: any of them are huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to pop and I'm going to get
some fire ash genetics out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the size of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the size of the seed that counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was just making the extra month
would make them girth out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily, but it'll definitely make
them darker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor seeds come out bigger typically
than indoor, but also that's very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: to the genetics you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen bigger seeds come from the
same cross outside as opposed to inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like there's all kinds of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I got a book too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't given you a book yet,
so we'll give you a book today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you sign it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun and I think it's all
about finding those exciting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are barracudas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chasing the next shiny object in
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do stuff that keeps me excited
that's aligned with my main focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a breeding book.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a new podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything comes back to genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to be the flower guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be the Gore-Tex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be the Velcro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be the guy that helps you make
your genetics better, your brand better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of where I'm at with that is I
can work with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I don't have enemies in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be people that don't like me,
but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like everybody for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have people that don't like you,
you're not doing sure right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be haters,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the environment we live in
currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the country sees things one way or
the other half sees things the other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got both of those people paying
attention to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are not going to be like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Negative energy is still energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what you got, you got negative
energy for them, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than none energy as long as
you're not pointing a gun at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hate all you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I laugh at that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have spent your time hanging out
with your kid, but you chose to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: rage on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mutual friends at SF Kana,
it's like them and a handful of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the industry is so small
within our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows everybody and we all kind
of lift each other up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know who the bad actors are
and who the bad guys are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you've done it long enough and
I've done it long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we know who the bad guys are
and they stay at a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might still exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's bad guys out there,
but I work within the people that help
[SPEAKER_00]: lift me up and I help lift them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this community of good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have the same kind of vision about
what quality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same kind of vision about what
ethics are because I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's teamwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, not one person can
do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stay focused on what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got SF Kana that grows amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all these guys in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of guys that grow really
amazing flower and then there's everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always wanted to be aligned with the
best, whatever the best quality wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell in love with Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never gone back and I always attach
myself to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want because that's what I
want to consume for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I want to smoke the
best stuff I can possibly get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life's short.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you pick the old steak?
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you drink the moldy milk?
Only the dry age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry age, yes, but not the one that's 99
cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go for the discount steaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you not be wanting to smoke the
best?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, you and I are in that
within arm's length if we're not doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves to do just that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the latest and greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Zetopia, I feel like it hasn't made
it fully on the scene like some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things, but it is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as special as anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes good down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think back to the actual palette and
connoisseur and understanding of what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're smoking, if you're not looking for
it, it goes right over your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not familiar with Zeturps,
if you're not familiar how Zeturps affect
[SPEAKER_02]: other plants and other genetics,
I don't even know that I get a ton of Z in
[SPEAKER_02]: the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something different about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just another LCG, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visually, it looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even on the nose, it's pretty dang close
to your run of the mill LCG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you exhale, you're like, oh,
there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really good effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's all about effect with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as strong as LCG, but it is
somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a diet Skittles either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate diet Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate stuff that's a diet version of the
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing better than Skittles as
far as on the candy where it's straight
[SPEAKER_00]: candy, but there's things like Moonbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this on my show a lot
with Moonbow where it's complex enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's not just straight Skittles,
but it's Skittly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that do-si-do, and it's complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke it, you're like, wow,
down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm really looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes me want to smoke another joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to get high and you open your
toolbox with 200 fucking flavors in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: how often do you open it with a conscious
decision prior to opening it, what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going for?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times you open it and you're just
like, I'm feeling like this one right
[SPEAKER_02]: here, because I get that with the Zetopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smoking my Sunday paper,
but I don't want to smoke it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke it intermittently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to smoke the Zetopia all the
time, but I find myself, maybe because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's new, lately I've been like,
paper, Zetopia, my other strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to lean this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's so often not an unconscious
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if I want to go, if I'm like,
I'm fucking pissed or I need to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep and I need to be this high,
I'll go smoke some turtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the time I'm like,
you know, it's shades of the same color,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have some that are heavy over here
and some that are heavy over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find myself gravitating towards that
Zetopia lately as opposed to some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: other routine strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I have the jar test,
you know, it's like the first thing gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jar is exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke 50 different things,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a jar of this and a jar of that and
a jar of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have that, you know, I have 20 jars
of extract or more than that actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like 40 or 50 different types of
rosin right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can pick from any of them,
but you know, the one that goes first is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gravitate towards Skittles,
even though that's not the strongest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of times that's my daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I like the church just easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, other than the one that we're
about to try in a little bit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on my last podcast, we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we took dry hits and then we
smoked and tried the soil grown versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think I did the dry hits and
she did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Hallie from Humboldt seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got really high on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not used to getting
high like that from Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is usually you go up to about
here and I can maintain that here all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long where it's, it doesn't get me over
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can super functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything on it, but that soil grown,
it was more, it was almost perfumey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was candy perfume, like Terps up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have, we have the refires.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's the true test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say the same fucking
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see if you know which
one is, you know, after hearing all this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to tell the difference
on the refire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see how much of a
difference it was from the last podcast to
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the refire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious in the comments after I
watched this episode and I read the
[SPEAKER_02]: comments, what is the public's opinion on
refire?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I have so much weed, like I give it
to my family and friends or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother-in-law, my pops, my,
you know, my, my close homies where I can
[SPEAKER_02]: roll a fresh joint all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the weed for me, if the weed is so
I, I always, after I take 10 or 15 hits,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a tiny puff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything left in the paper goes out and
then I never extinguish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like put it in the end of a glass tube
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just stops smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 30, 40 minutes later,
when it's time to reup, I go back outside
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you said, that is the true test,
especially if you can light it three times
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're like, this shit still tastes
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the old school Peli,
the old school champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Roach tasted almost damn,
if not better than the front, because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting that fucking resinous,
gluey shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full circle, Johnny Caron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I used to get the real
champagne from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but the real champagne was like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would put it out and Champele is the
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good friends with Champele.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been friends a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's long story with that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like dude, that champagne was special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lots of long stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many long stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay Area is just such a small,
you know, community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of, if not now at one time,
influential cannabis people that went to
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking McIntyre high school, you know,
if the book of cannabis is written and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a map with little, you know,
hotspots like McIntyre high school in 89
[SPEAKER_02]: to 92, it's going to be blinking on the
map because there was quite a few people
[SPEAKER_02]: who have had a hand in the cannabis
industry and forming and the shaping at
[SPEAKER_02]: that place at one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of funny.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the high schools are really- All
the high schools, Berkeley, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: East Bay, you can go out into Concord and
go Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of where I was at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of guys from there remember the cat
piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, there was a lot of
legendary cat piss going around that
[SPEAKER_00]: Concord area all the way into Antioch,
you know, making it into the Bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, the fact that we have run
such parallel lives and are only three
[SPEAKER_02]: years apart and really haven't come across
each other at all until happenstance
[SPEAKER_02]: recently, it's kind of weird because
people with your resume and your longevity
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I feel like I know most of them,
especially if they're from the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whether they're good friends or
acquaintances or somebody I've met once or
[SPEAKER_02]: twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said before, this is long
overdue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like, I definitely, I definitely
like talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you because we don't really
talk it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't hung out before too many times,
you know, a few minutes here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the longest conversation I've ever
had with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to know how many similarities we
already share without, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: without knowing that ahead of time,
it's pretty fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we, we can sit here and think the
same shit, you know, without having to
[SPEAKER_02]: verbalize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're like, Oh yeah, that's
finished for damn sentence with the,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the true test of we, when you can
relight it and tell how good it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am curious if so, if you,
after you watch this, I do wonder,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I'll relight a fucking hash hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't face a hash hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just throw that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fucking though?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but even good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not throwing out anything,
but if it's a stew doinks, the last part
[SPEAKER_02]: is that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it gets too harsh, but I'm
definitely not throwing any, none of my
[SPEAKER_02]: cash packs, none of my stew doinks out,
none of my whole of these doinks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already like that bitch three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, if I know there's no more hash
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can go fire up another one,
but like who can face a hash hole?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, seriously, I have one friend
that comes over and takes my half joints
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's, you know, he comes over and I
don't like, I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't want him to get a waste
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I showed the bag of half to people
be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can be wasteful, but I don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do the relight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Longer than the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't leave it outside for three days
and then go relight it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's never good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour you could do that with and Capis you
can do that with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't really name other ones where
Capis, you could smoke it a week later and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, fuck that's Capis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll roll a joint at like noon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't finish it that night,
I'll smoke it the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also don't smoke flour every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke a ton of coal fire and flavor aid
and I dab a little bit as it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's definitely my least.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely my least form of
consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I went through a phase where all I did
was dab and it just fucked up my tolerance
[SPEAKER_02]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want to enjoy any flowers,
I still dab quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I mean, I've been like,
so the, the heiress from focus V is like
[SPEAKER_00]: my go-to, but then I got this Rover and
I've been on the Rover kick and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, that's so reminiscent of the
glass domes and the little, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the castle from a chess piece that
used to go a little metal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'd always get to the party like 15
minutes into the party, the glass dome
[SPEAKER_02]: would be busted in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke in two of these now with the glass
and, and, uh, dude, they, these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so Dip Device makes these,
so Dip Device made these straws,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got this straw from this dude
named Uncle Stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dip Device.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make the straw, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can just, it's the same idea,
but it's electric nectar collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love nectar collectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, I have, they gave me a couple of
pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I used them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know they had a new product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave me one hit off that it fucking
tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a quartz bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the inside, it's got the beads for
turps and I really, so for the price point
[SPEAKER_00]: is 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's amazing for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is not, you know,
they sent me some, there's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't pay me anything to talk good
about their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, a lot of these products are
expensive, but for the price, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple and easy to use, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, it's like, I feel like
taking it around other than breaking the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I had a container to store
it in, but it's simple and they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch, they have a flower pen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's like a volcano that's pocket
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sent them for the dab a do and I
didn't get them in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been using them and I,
you know, I share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: A rove?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Rover.
[SPEAKER_02]: That bowl you passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You passed me earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whatever it was tastes a great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing hit really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like that's a good price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then smoking before I go to the gym,
I usually dab because flower, I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling like flower everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it's that big of a deal,
but I go to the gym and I know everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: there, not that it matters, but like,
I feel like weed, basically when I smoke a
[SPEAKER_00]: fat joint, it makes me a little more
tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I take a dab, it wakes me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we also, if, if you're doing any
kind of cardio, I'm not trying to smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like a flower before I go do
cardio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm going to take one fat dab or
hit my pen twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lungs are still going to be tight,
but if I sit there and so it'll open me
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just do one nice big hit and it'll
make me not have to think about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like cardio is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, or even lifting weights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It fucking closes my shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need like a, I Buterall hit the Dewey
and then take a nice fucking hit of some
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalers, like open my chest again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some caffeine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some aerosol caffeine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smoking weed and drinking coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best combo ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say most donors do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a lot, I feel like coffee is
the balance for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like throughout the day, I don't drink
a ton of coffee, but I definitely drink
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee in the morning and I'll drink it
around one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, if I drink coffee at five or six,
it's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I drink it three times a day,
I just don't enjoy it the next morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love my morning cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take my dog to the park, rip my pen a few
times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have fucking tackle emails and phone
calls and all the other bullshit that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel like it makes it,
especially with the extract in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm smoking some good rosin,
if I take a hit of that and I drink some
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee, I'm just super clear headed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I smoke a huge joint, I save that for
like afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evening, evening, evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually in the afternoon podcast,
we usually smoke joints on the podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like, I like the extract too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different types of rosin
now and you can kind of get different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects from just so many different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we not too long ago released a BHO
line, which has been fucking doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for so much for grabbing
it because it's, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked for when possible butters so I can
get the donut hole because I smoke them
[SPEAKER_02]: and I can't offer rosin as a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of my stuff really hashes,
which is another reason I did the phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt that I did the breeding project that
I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could hopefully, you know,
I'm looking for six to 10 strains max,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is doable considering the
genetics I put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I should be able to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one or two of those really needs to
give me two plus three percent yield so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can offer, you know, a quality
rosin in the product because I smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do kind of feel on the outside
because I don't have a product that can
[SPEAKER_02]: really, my butters do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for people that are, you know,
it's a really cost-effective way to roll
[SPEAKER_02]: some donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really clean way to smoke BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you, I mean, it gives you the
hole too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smokes a hash hole just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end can be this much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that hate on,
on BHO, but like BHO you're not losing
[SPEAKER_00]: those water soluble turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm offering it, I'm offering it to
offer it because I can't, I've tried all
[SPEAKER_02]: my shit and 2% is not a reason to stop
growing flour and make rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to have hash makers
that hate you at 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, just to get them to do it,
you're going to be twisting arms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my flour does too well that take a
2% return on hash would be just a huge L,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, aside from the amount of work to
get nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just, it wouldn't, it'd be going,
it wouldn't be cost-effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully with some of these new
crosses, I'm going to get something that
[SPEAKER_02]: washes like the turtles, a dumper.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's dumped 5% a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the turtle cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time when Jigga gave me and my
old partner cookies, we grew one tray of
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies in a room in a building full of
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cookies early on, I fucking miss
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love some form cut or some cookies
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mutual friend has platinum cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: We called him the zebra, but it was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: My partner and I were harvesting the room
and like, there was one OG Kush plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: was like abnormally large.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a foot and a half, two feet taller
than any other plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just cut it off and put it to the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we did, dealt with the rest of
what we had to do with the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of weeks later, he's like,
bro, I got a fucking seed off that OG
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fucking thing was, I mean,
I tell it to, it was a size of a marble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, but it was fucking huge and it
was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just stripes all over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were so disappointed in the yield
of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also OG was still king at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finding OG adjacent things,
which was never possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was sub OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never made anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got better crosses making OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always got work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some good shit, but it was never
as good as OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the quality traits that everybody
loves are recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you typically, it's hard to
get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting them in the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it takes some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a long time before people had good
OG seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I never saw OG from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all, it was cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my old friend was the dude from,
brings from Florida in his fucking sock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diet OG, diet skittles, diet OG,
a lot of, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it was, it was unbeknownst to us
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought we had new OG, but it was the
plant, the girl, the cookie girl next to
[SPEAKER_02]: her was freaky back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just, and puffed on the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got this, everything about it was
cookie dominant aside from the effect and
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect it was like, it really got me
stoned in comparison to what, that was the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing I didn't like about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't like the yield and I didn't
like the potency and compared to OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was fucking, it was the shit
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it missed what I appreciated about
smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the strain we got, we called it
sweet cooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really, I always think we misnamed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have called it sour cooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have taken off much better
because it was, it was cookies times gas,
[SPEAKER_02]: times sour gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that strain, my, my old partners at
turtle pie ended up crossing that with the
[SPEAKER_02]: original SFV cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where turtle pie came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was cookie to OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That strain was crossed back to OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if you see her and smell her,
like she, there's not a ton of OG visuals
[SPEAKER_02]: or nose to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you smoke, you're like,
oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the strength, you get the strength
just like you get, I mean, cookies was
[SPEAKER_00]: strong too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cookies was popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big old cookie nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like four fingers or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, then it's spaghetti's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the problem that I had with
cookies was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing with the old OG that we
got, there was just OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, it would spaghetti out where
you had to trellis it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no way to grow it unless you
wanted a bush that ran along the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: because it would literally grow up and
flop over four inch node spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: little buds, you know, ThinMit was
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: ThinMit got, dude, that was a brick in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing plants, spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean if I didn't grow OG,
I didn't have to triple trellis?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go blue dream, you don't need trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about trellis?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, it only took me like three
harvests to be like, okay, they're this
[SPEAKER_02]: tall, put a fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wasn't, I didn't use to clean my
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I first started, I didn't rip
everything underneath the canopy off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was learning, you know, my buddy,
my buddy came over and taught me how to
[SPEAKER_02]: de-leaf the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what the, you just ruined my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no solar panels left.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, just fucking wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, I was like, oh,
wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some people and they just pull it so
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They strip it so hard where I'm like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they get crazy yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never been one to completely pull
off every leaf to where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everybody has their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with under canopy, you don't have
to clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you getting paid for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf or bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grow less leaf and more bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: The energy's going somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can go to your leaf or you can go to
the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the under canopy lighting, but you
don't have to clean the under canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Favins are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Favins are crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All our friends use Favins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, when you're getting 30 to
50% more yield and you're getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: purple buds on the bottom than you're on
the top, it's hard to argue with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did that years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hung T5s around my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so I mean, it was, it wasn't under
canopy, but I got full side canopy and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had crossover light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, T5s don't really get that far,
but I definitely noticed the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also noticed a huge difference in power,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little phototron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the phototron, same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first shit I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to grow in a phototron in the San
Jose and it just was miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how I know you're old?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grew with the phototron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, I grew with the phototron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was where I got my start too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever try the octagon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the sickest shit I could never
master, but it was so dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the wooden octagon, my friend,
yeah, Micah, my good friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend and business partner for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came over to the house one day and was
like, he had the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he had, okay, this is the wood
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the angles we have to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go all the way up to Willets to
the garden spout and buy these Dutch pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were five gallon square pots with
little holes in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were five bucks a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was 13 plants per row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And per light, there was 26 plants per
light growing towards it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had thousands of the 600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did 2000, some people with three
600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the cool tubes that ran in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool tubes, then there was light on
chains, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people just used to hang them,
but we put the cool tubes in there to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very strained depending on what
would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to grow something that you could
veg just for very shortly and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: still get nice buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow some Chem 91 like I did,
and we got walls of larv.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was straight, it was Chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the West Coast dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it as the dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my buddy had, I think he had three in
the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he also had room lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the backsides flowered out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up having to hang trellises on
the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, there's so much fucking,
it all grows right towards the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another triple trellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to hang trellis after,
cause he was growing Kush and Sours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just, it was getting super long
and tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it would even, if it touched the
cool tube, it was getting burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that damn cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP was the best thing to go in octagons
because they were short and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: really chunk out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight weeks and you're.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like GDP still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anybody growing it because
it's a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, good bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a lot of good bubba lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have this philosophical
conversation with people, like what I like
[SPEAKER_02]: and what sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to sell people what I think they
will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I have what I know people will
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how the business works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I here and there like, try this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like adding, I've added Surebanger to two
of my strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now and that's outside what a lot of my
people like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fabuloso does pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping the original sin is going
to do fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty confident because it had,
like I said, it hits the fabuloso is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little light where this is a little more
heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But trying to curve the market to your
will is kind of tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's only going to go so far and then
it's going to bounce back and it might
[SPEAKER_02]: happen one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to happen every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to stop trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nine strains that do really well,
regardless of how long I've had them
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're grown perfectly and
they're quality strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four or five more strains in my
repertoire that do okay and get grown and
[SPEAKER_02]: offered sporadically just to mix things
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every time I'm adding, if I had three
new strains, one of them is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: something I want you to like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not something I know you're going to like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of candy on candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm adding Zetopia to Grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grits and Jam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Grits and Jam is a candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has an herbal nose, like an
herbal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to bring some today, but I just
didn't have any left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only had smalls and I didn't want to
show up with smalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Grits and Jam to me is a candy,
but it has not oregano or rosemary,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some sort of cooking herb essence in
the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've added Zetopia to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pumped because Grits and Jam is one
of my best sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just never know though with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get some totally different you
have an idea of what might happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll tell you one thing about smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look the same in a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sure do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like smalls too sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Skittles, smalls are still
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not picky always with smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind smoking smalls myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke them all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I go to SAC, I'm like, just give me
smalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need the fucking Big Buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: That needs to go to the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: My old hatchlings, thanks fucking big
buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: BCC now with pedals, even though pedals
does really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know, I had to change my
hatchlings to pedals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same product, different name, less kid
friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way more female friendly though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a couple of bud tenders like,
Oh, a lot of women buy this, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of anecdotally hard being a 50
year old dude trying to design and market
[SPEAKER_02]: to women specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just grow shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dive into the soccer moms.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the pedals, I've had a couple of bud
tenders like, Oh, I have a ton of women
[SPEAKER_02]: who buy this all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me what else I got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of girls that smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love them to be turtle pie fans.
Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know the ACE sell out,
my smalls sell out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I go to SAC and I get my little
kickbacks, I'm like, just give me smalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need too much Big Buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, it all smokes the same in
the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good smalls are good smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people, you know, and it's
like, I do, I just like good flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I want it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, if it's small,
if it's big, if it's ugly, I don't care if
[SPEAKER_00]: the weeds ugly, if it tastes amazing and
it makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you, do you see pretty Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty ugly Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles is not the most beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we were looking at some today and
I was like, yeah, it's not, it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: looker, but at the end of the day it
tastes absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Peli wasn't an amazing
looker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it being maybe cause it was,
it was always flat cause it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was squished, but it was,
it was like gold and red and had like,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe I remember like wheat looking like,
like buds as opposed to like nugs and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was champagne.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had champagne and it was like nice fat
buds and the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to get in this specific turkey
bag that our mutual friend had and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: always just caked on the outside of the
turkey bag on the inside where the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you could take a razor and
you could scrape up the crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it was so frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember having champagne in
turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got champagne in the crinkly turkey
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's the soft ones and then
there was the crinkly harder ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the crinkly, crinkly turkey
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I wish I could have one wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you help me out with my memory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are safe way bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to cure in safe way plastic and
paper bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my little technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to cure in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was my method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause always Jay hooked my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a wooden, the room I grew in
initially was all wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wood panels, you know, and so the
closet was wooden in the winter time,
[SPEAKER_02]: the wood would be wet more than it'd be
fucking dry because that's just how the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture was in the, in the, you know,
the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was always, two to three weeks of
hang dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just being patient always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the, when the tip of the,
when the, the tip of the cola,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fattest nugs snapped, I knew it was
time to take it off the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would take my safe way plastic bags
and I'd fill it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd roll it down and then I put it inside
a safe way paper bag and I'd roll that
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd have eight or 10 of those sitting
out and I'd go get a thick like wool or
[SPEAKER_02]: fleece black, green, blue blanket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd lay it over the top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the sun would come through the
window and it would heat the blanket up,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would in turn heat the bags up very
slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's through a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's frisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd be like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, just smoke my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be, it'd be the kind of weed
that felt super wet and was perfectly dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite was greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that greasy, but it's totally
cured cause you get to snap on the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it still feels like it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just oil where it's completely dried
from the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to do that by the fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a two or three day burping
without glass jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it wasn't really, it was never
burping because it was never, I would,
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever I burped, that's when I would
fuck shit up because I would leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: closed for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, six hours today was too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have been three hours,
you know, and whatever it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I tried, it never worked for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I figured out this,
my own routine and I had great success
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's growing the OG I did is part
of the reason I got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it definitely wasn't selling
beast beasters and the fuck, you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was getting the cultivation bug
and, you know, having a few grows and
[SPEAKER_02]: learning all the fucking trials and
tribulations that the gamut of shit from
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs to police, to robbers, to,
you know, bad harvest, all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fuck, I may do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is who I want to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is who I am.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever use dark energy back in the day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, was that, no, I'm thinking,
no, I'm thinking that wasn't the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: made the, it was the sea kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the sea kelp that was like steroids
for your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it's, it's banned now
because it's like a PGR, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: PGR.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it was, it was actually sea kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea kelp is now banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they consider a PGR?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, but it was like the big game
changer back in the day that made our buds
[SPEAKER_00]: swell up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the turps, everything liquid karma
was another good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is the nineties when it was
like, there wasn't a thousand different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So see in the nineties, I wasn't growing
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started growing 99, 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when we got the octagons was
around that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was 98 or 99 that I started
growing weed in an atrium in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a glass covered atrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up just completely blocking
off like a fat third of it and had two
[SPEAKER_02]: 600s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy taught me to grow Afgu and
J1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, J1 was actually great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I made a J1 bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my old crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, it was super bubblegummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also a super sativa like sativa
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely that more awake, but with the
bubblegum turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: J1 was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was the other one you grew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afgu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afgu was another one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also the most frostiest thing
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew like three and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grew like three light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a chunker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big, massive bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally can't fuck these up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do whatever you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try some shit out and then figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, and I'm like, all I want to do
is grow Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, crawl, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we give these a try?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking about it long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do the refire test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Refire me up, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of AB testing we're doing and
we're going to go soil versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a fun harmless test that we
can both enjoy.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoke joints, I, I it's like at
nighttime before dinner or like in between
[SPEAKER_02]: rounds of call of duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have like 15 minutes to smoke a
whole joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll do the refire.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, we smoke really good flour,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you can refire it a bunch and it's
still, if it's really good all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the road, you taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how many times or times you
refire it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was Fino hunting the Tahiti
midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was given a couple of strains,
like, you know, which one of these works
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one worked because in the course of a
conversation with somebody over like an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour, we smoked this doink and we kept
relighting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were both like, damn, this is the
third time we've relit this and it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can still get terms off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on number one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super smooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, I don't, I call it a twang.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's what other people
describe it, but it's that it's that
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct palette flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if it's lemon, it's like eating
the peel, not smelling the lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's, if it's something like
that, it's more like not from the smell of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like the, the citrus taste of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that the oils behind it,
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has that distinct profile that
everybody's looking for when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking their skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing we, when you smoke
skittles, you expect, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll swap it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were kind of rolled in a rush
yesterday to do the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, yeah, I just, you know,
how dare you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These 1.75 or actually I think I put two
grams in each one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you actually weigh it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like then I can get more
consistent and more even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally I prefer weighing out every
single one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I try to get that the specific
grind, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the weight in each one,
the way I twist it at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it burns down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that all those things are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use the glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use can't gar glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a little brush that you twist
the end and a little bit of liquid comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that the crutch sticks to it
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like, is it like that agave stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sweet, a little sugar, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little sugar in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use the raw crutches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the raw crutches with the element
papers and the organa tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been working on this since before
I started this podcast, we've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one thing we keep on
perfecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I'm looking for a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for how it burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for the drip, but also the
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that paper taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taste through the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taste the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it burn the back of your throat?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use the wrong papers, you taste
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not about tasting paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're testing or if you're
doing any kind of trials of your weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to use the same grinder,
the same paper, the same amount of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: and cut all the variables out that you can
so that all you're really testing is the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, cause a raw versus an
element versus a OCB, they all taste
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a different flavor for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste them a little bit different
in the back of your throat sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then some of the stronger
tasting papers I'm not into, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: taste the flower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we're looking for drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the ash look?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like better?
[SPEAKER_00]: One or two?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that one better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say this, that one is definitely
smoother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm coughed after every hit with this
one where that one, I got one cough out of
[SPEAKER_02]: three hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard because of the, I'm taking hits
four through eight off this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's like, I want to say
this is getting me higher, but it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: the compounding of being the second four
hits I've taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But flavor wise, are you getting,
you said this was smoother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a different turf profile
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: They taste, that one to me has the more
what I'm used to deter profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one has it's, I taste the Z,
but it's a different profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like this one's perfumey a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, cause there is like a, like if you
spray perfume and you get it in your mouth
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always thought people would say
perfumey like it smelled like perfume,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not that it's the coating in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like coating in the mouth feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it tastes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is making my hands tremble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love for sativas to love me back,
but my can have a noise system as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate the Terps does not appreciate
the effect of sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I know I'm using outdated terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it until we, the community come up
with new vernacular to, to describe what
[SPEAKER_02]: we used to use sativa and indica for,
I'm going to continue to use these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we come up with new terms and it's an
acceptable way to talk about it again,
[SPEAKER_02]: because for me it's always about feeling
or taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has the feeling I would associate
with sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go LFVs or whatever, but I don't
know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativas is just what we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I wrong that OG Kush genetically would
be classified as a sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush can be a long flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think OG Kush is a hybrid for sure,
but I've seen it win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it win Indica cups and I've seen
it win sativa cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it genetically?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's everything's a hybrid
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it lean more sativa or Indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's depending on the OG cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll switch and go back to this one and
I'll go back to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the ash and I feel like the
ash on that was burning a little cleaner,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as taste wise, this is a,
this is levels up in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Terp wise, I think this is up here
and, but that is the Skittles that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Skittles that I know and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one is different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is also strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling that's the stronger one
because fucking like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles does not get me high like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I smoke doinks of what this would
be akin to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walk away unsatisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I'm ready to go jump in my
car and hit my coal fire or just fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hit the coal fire or roll up something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if, if I'm in sack now that
Jordan's there all the time, they got like
[SPEAKER_02]: P 90 and shit laying around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll grab some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I just tried this purple Dino for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like blown away with how good
that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's friends with my friend,
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get him on the interview for a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've smoked this flower geek out so
hard because he's technically,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an amazing fucking cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how, I don't know about
his breeding skills all that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but regardless, Kyle who works with him is
one of the best breeders in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my good friends and we've done
stuff together and he, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle is from Washington.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle's the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle's like, yeah, Kyle, Kyle also likes
to nerd out and Kyle likes good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just, he loves weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jordan and I have been talking about Kyle
a little bit lately and he was just
[SPEAKER_02]: basically letting me know that who he was
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, so I definitely know
that reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't met him yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had the pleasure, but I
definitely know the reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's a, yeah, he's, he's,
he basically is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm telling you for Skittles that
doesn't smoke like Skittles in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't know if I want to smoke so
much on my last podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had I known it was that strong,
I was super ripped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to watch the podcast and see
how different I am from before,
[SPEAKER_02]: before and after the joint because inside
I'm going a million miles an hour right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Skittles doesn't usually give me gab
some OG Kush right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles usually doesn't give me tight
eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Skittles as far as eyes are
fucking, yeah, it's gotta be that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that's, that's making the effect
because it's, it's the soil one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cause it doesn't, Skittles doesn't
really, and it doesn't taste perfumey like
[SPEAKER_00]: that normally, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is that traditional Z taste that
everybody's looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one is like, what is up with
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only variable different literally
the same lights, the same harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one variable is soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so take it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you equate that to the slightly
darker ash as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, because I feel like with soil,
you probably need a longer flush and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to get a different, well,
maybe not so different, but definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: like it takes longer to flush soil for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we used to do two weeks on soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do too much soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm the seed guy anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm mostly cocoa and I love cocoa
flour, but really soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something special about the effect
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like of this stuff, especially I'm like
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make me feel like that
normally.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are amazing on the relay,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day later, literally 24 hours later,
we do these podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you see them one week to the
next, but like we were filming these ones
[SPEAKER_00]: back to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to experience the relay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was perfect for this instance where we
can test these on two days and get similar
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think really special stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: SF Canada, dude, they do a good job with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a good job with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been good for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do some good candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they get the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like those guys know what's up.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super sour tangy or sour tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like a fucking skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were holding on to a fucking sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be so fucking high in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too fucking high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best and the worst at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so far up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just in the up there I didn't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was uncomfortable being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ghost Train Hayes used to do that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ghost Train would be like,
yeah, that was like rocket feel where you
[SPEAKER_00]: would just blast off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super silvers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were around back with the 97 super
silver in the Bay Area, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That super silver was so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the strongest and it would
just get you lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stronger than anything else around
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people liked it because it was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the turf profile was nose burning,
like intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it was right, it was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like big, big chonkers in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had these big, huge buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because like some of the
stuff that I saw back then that I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was average, now I see it like power
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, eh, power plant, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it now and it's like,
whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it in Oakland, I believe,
Bluebird Cafe and some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, there was some stuff,
there was so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan back in the day was super fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, so I was a buyer for a while and a
lot of times I had to take people's word
[SPEAKER_02]: for it because I'd never seen Romulan the
first time until I saw it the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I saw it the third time and
it was the same look and smell and thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, this is officially
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all these crazy strain,
nine pound hammer and all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that would come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until I knew I was or wasn't, I ran with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was cool having that time on that
side of the desk where I could learn from
[SPEAKER_02]: all the work that other people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can evaluate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of the small circle of growers and
smokers that I hung out with is to be put
[SPEAKER_02]: in a position to view hundreds of pounds a
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without smoking them, making good
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys, the buyers at the dispensaries
back in the day that would smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the most respect for those guys.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everybody has time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at Harborside, you look at BPG
and it's like the lines a mile long for
[SPEAKER_00]: people trying to vend, but like really you
can gauge the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, by the looks, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these guys have to make good
decisions by the looks, but also you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, so the dispensary I worked
for was coming out of an older dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they needed someone to put good weed
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know shit about being a
buyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew good fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew vaguely what it was worth
within a certain realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like things I'd never seen before,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what crazy depths were worth
until I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But being able to see all the weed and try
it, because my eyes fooled me quite a few
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stopped looking at the weed first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would just open, I'd talk to you and
open your bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I closed my eyes and I'd smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd look at you and your eyes and
close my eyes again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted my nose to make my first
buying decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause my nose didn't lie to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyes would fucking lie to me all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fucking looks so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it fucking smell good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause ultimately if it's rinsed and
flushed and cured correctly, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like weed that doesn't get you
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't buy a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to buy so much Blue Dream and I
didn't want to buy Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, but it was like the blue
collar strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, I always had Blue Dream on the
menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Fire Blue Dream is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire Blue Dream is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like grown correctly, the real cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not everyone's cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was using that place to elevate myself
and eventually my brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started the brand there,
I elevated my knowledge of the game,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the industry, of what everybody else
was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My knowledge of strain diversity grew
intensely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned all about hashes and edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, why are the edibles and the
hash companies the only ones with names?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why don't the flower companies have
names?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started telling the growers like,
do you need to name your company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have four strains on my shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one knows that they're yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every Kurova black bar versus coffee
bean, whatever those things are called.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get all the hype, but they don't
exist without us anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an edible maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of edibles, I got gummies coming
out soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Passion fruit, fuck passion fruit combos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love rosin gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I love rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that I can even list the rosin
on, I'm getting all the packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: constraints, but I'd like to be able to
list, you know, what exactly flavor rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: is going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my white thorn rose gummies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those rosin gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hearing about this white thorn
rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was like, Oh, you can smell the
jar I have, but they weren't giving me a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that smells, it's,
it's, you're like the, you're the fourth
[SPEAKER_02]: person who's like this white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the visual thing that comes with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purple hash and the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's colorful and the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I maybe have some dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But either way it's feel good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's one of those ones where you
smoke it, you smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like everybody needs to try
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm, this is pretty good feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pleasantly, again, I'm a little more
up like underneath the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hands are trembling a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully my voice isn't quivering too
much, but I'm surprisingly lit off of how
[SPEAKER_02]: the seven or eight hits that I took.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like the, the level of stuff stoned I
am right now is pretty high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a little uncomfortable being
completely, you know, forthcoming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But regardless where I'm at, I'm like,
I'm pretty fucked up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't usually get that way off
Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can smoke Skittles all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dirt something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've smoked the other one before.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I say, I walk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a jerk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get hated on for not
loving Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love the turf profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I smoke weed from feeling first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like turtle pie doesn't taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like a gassy cook, like a mild
gassy cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smells like cardboard, but it fucking gets
me so lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreos is more cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, yeah, the turtle pie
definitely has something to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've had people say like wet
basement or they're like, when will it be
[SPEAKER_02]: done curing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, that shit's three weeks old,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been cured for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, Oh, again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mixed turtle pie and Zetovia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking so pumped off that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got like 12 beans out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like turtle likes the
breed either.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was very stingy with the amount of
seeds that she gave me from the,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've never, we read, we did the Magnum
turtle, but I wasn't there for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got three iterations, two were
terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Magnum turtle came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Magnature is gone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it fell out of favor with us,
but our friends at SF Canon, seemed to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of favor with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wanting to bring it onto the rec line,
I was like, okay, so we did it in sack a
[SPEAKER_02]: few times and then like three times in a
row it hermed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were like, we can't,
we don't have time to fix this and we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't afford to grow this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got rid of it, which it is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably stress induced, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got some systemic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: They, anytime a strip, like they've had
the shit can some fire-ass strains because
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter what on the third time they
heard, you know, they, it grew once or
[SPEAKER_02]: twice good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it hermes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next time it's cool and then
it hermes bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, it's gotta go because
it can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersex trades can fuck up a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that place is not where there's so
many things to hunt or have a catastrophic
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination orgy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not designed for that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all these new flavors coming out
that are outside of the spectrum of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the market is looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for more of the long flowering
varieties to get mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we mix them in with the gelatos to
see where it goes, to get people excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I feel like before we got LCG sour
D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down to fucking try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I made some cool crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some double cherry gelato with the
Weasel's diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did the Skittles back across the
ZBX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a ZBX that I made that has a
Weasel's diesel in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like there's some interesting Finos.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends in my network said they
just smoked some LCG OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could remember which one of you
said it, I would be happily say who you
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was, I was like, okay, let's fucking
check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like LCG is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hypothesize that there's a lot of people
who like to smoke weed that don't like to
[SPEAKER_02]: get hella stoned, which would be perfect
for the LCGs, you know, perfect for
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like LCG is a little, the LCG is a
little stronger than Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not in, it's not in the gas
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the GMO, the OG, the,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour is probably LCG range.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on who's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had sour that would like, it would test
it 14%, but it would give you couch lock
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to me, like sour is a gassy version
of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm not bastardizing either one,
but like the, the, they have that distinct
[SPEAKER_02]: turf profile and a distinct potency level
that I don't know that one, I didn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to need to smoke some sour again
to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's been a while since I've had
some fire sour, but like, I never liked it
[SPEAKER_02]: because I was a Kush dude and sour was
like, eh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We warmed up with the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just the turps over, you know,
that one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also like the effect of sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I relate to, you know,
I could smoke all day and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like sour was one of those ones
you enjoyed in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You enjoy it in the afternoon or the
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles can be kind of like that for me
too, but I feel like the sour was like
[SPEAKER_00]: special and it was, the effect was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if either one of those would
be evening strange for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if I've been smoking them all
day, I'm definitely turning it up a level
[SPEAKER_02]: or turning it down a level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I like mixing up at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I doing that night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want something super strong,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before bed for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that guava cherry is a good nighttime
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another SF can of guava cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got some cherry gushers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's, I like that one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the TC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the TC for their cherry gushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking, uh, like random
Jell-O-Nate lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been pretty fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Jell-O-Nate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super, I like Jell-O-Nate a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had a phase with it, so it's,
it's not, it's not new, but I never like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had a zip of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I maybe, you know, hit a joint here or
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about lemon tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on lemon tree?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I had some fucking
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And melonade, the melonade, I was a huge
fan of melon, like good melonade grown
[SPEAKER_00]: organic living soil, melonade from Kano
Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them to cut and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I get cantaloupe turps with
good skittles where you smoke it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like fresh melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like especially, uh, when they harvest it
around like day 53 and it's like super
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity, but it's usually not super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one is just all turps and all
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can, I can a big joint like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can sit there and smoke that 30,
40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super high, but it like,
it leaves me fulfilled because it tasted
[SPEAKER_00]: so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny how that works, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you taste it in your teeth,
where it's like, yeah, a good dab of
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles can do that for me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some skittles rosin right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had any good skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had any skittles rosin made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get some, uh, mountain man melt some
of their chem Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that because it gave me what I
liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave me the gassy, but I also had that
Z background to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was pretty fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the little punch, but also the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the papaya crosses too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of papaya stuff going
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes amazing in rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great when I get, like, I like it
when they come in hash holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, also it's like when you're going to
give me, I want that diverseness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're giving me, if you're giving
me the papaya, like roll it in some
[SPEAKER_02]: biscotti.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like give me that gas with that super
sweet little punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put your skills with your skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that, but I feel like it's in
that, that is complimentary in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way, but I feel like using the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty is like blending wine or
blending, whatever pairing it is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got that skill too, the guys that
are blending rosin now too, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking two different things, putting them
together, you're getting some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually shout out Stuart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just won the proper, uh, the,
uh, preferred gardens, uh, doink roll off
[SPEAKER_02]: after like a couple of week long
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats, Drew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who's the man fucking a amazing
wedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in Hawaii while he was winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't really get the attention from
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have, but, uh, he had some of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I wasn't so high, I could maybe
remember what the comma was, but whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: the winning comma was, and you can look it
up on his page.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, it was such a killer combination
of two different flag, like diverse enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to where you're like, okay, you're the
first three or four hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, and then that hash starts
kicking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow, that's fucking just
like, gives you this extra little flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: blast in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had one piece of advice for your
younger self that was coming up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, what would that one piece of
advice be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't blow your fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had so many snowboards and snowboarding
jackets and fucking Jordans that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: have rather sushi dinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were worth it because they were
community building.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a homie who gave me the best advice
that I never followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kicked myself all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, tert, you blow all your money
on bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I know you like spending money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like spending money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I go buy gold coins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're an ounce each.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, and this at this time,
they were 350 an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember those the same as an ounce of
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, so one of, you know,
one ounce out of every pound, you go spend
[SPEAKER_02]: that money and on a fucking on a gold
coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He took me to his house one day and you
might have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your parents probably have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had these picture books from like the
seventies with like super colors on the
[SPEAKER_02]: front and like had a little spiral plastic
thing on each page.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this dude had a fucking gold coin in
each one of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were like 19 or 20 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know when or if here,
I don't talk to him too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I did, but I don't, that was the
best piece of advice because I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if you sold them or kept them or did some
of both, but the ones he was buying at 350
[SPEAKER_02]: and under are now what 2000, 2000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the advice I wish I would have
followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I wouldn't have spent all my
money flexing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's all it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once I got my car, it had beat
and rims and tinted windows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought it was fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really had I bought property,
it would have been much fucking better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate, gold, crypto, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a long time to believe in
crypto and the first two or three times I
[SPEAKER_02]: invested, I lost everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So doge, come back, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took somebody really smart to half
explain how crypto works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was still like, it's still unicorn
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, it's basically unicorn money.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, this, if we both agree it's a
million bucks, it's a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of basically how crypto
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm a super, super
basically- That's how paper money works
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you're 100% right, but we're not
taught that as children, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: paper money and coin jingle jangle,
it's, that's how you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like- You both have to agree that it's
worth that for it to be worth that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So- We're told it's worth that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been, but we're indoctrinated
into believing that cause it's been our
[SPEAKER_02]: whole life way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now somebody's like, I got this new money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 97 digits long and you never hold it
or it doesn't jingle, it doesn't fold.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never see it until you pull it out
of the bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but this, I don't know how many
fucking numbers there are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's 150 numbers in your fucking,
in your Bitcoin address, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this, this, this is your,
this is your money value right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you sure?
[SPEAKER_02]: But today it's worth 500 bucks less than
it was worth yesterday, but next week
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll be worth 300 bucks more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost a bunch, but I got, I got a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how that plays out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the, I like the precious metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gold standard may go back to the
gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not good investing advice,
but I think gold is interesting and silver
[SPEAKER_00]: is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you shouldn't just look at
working at nine to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should look at investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a young thing or a thing that
young people can do is look at
[SPEAKER_00]: investments, look at the future,
not just so linear, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: smart man told me the way to be rich is to
make money while you sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figure out how to make money while you
sleep, how to figure out how to make your
[SPEAKER_02]: money, make money for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you do, you got to do,
but you, that you're using that to be you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably don't grow weed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's stay out of the can of disease if
you want to make money.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it technically makes money while
you sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, man, one mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we talked about curing your fucking
dry and or flushing and it has no value or
[SPEAKER_02]: such a little value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the value is the lesson you learned.
Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully someone will blast it and I can
get some BHR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can pass testing remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the world we live in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remediate stuff out of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild, but if people are trying to
find out more about turtle pie company and
[SPEAKER_00]: about yourself, where should they go?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a beautiful question
because that's something I want to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ironically, a couple of weeks ago,
we did a post about how I was switching my
[SPEAKER_02]: posting philosophy for Instagram because
of all of the shit that goes on when I
[SPEAKER_02]: just post weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not allowed to post weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen they change their TOU,
but then you, and they are allowed to,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then you do and you still get dinged.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did this post saying my new
philosophy is just to post content or
[SPEAKER_02]: goofy shit or whatever, and not so much
weed porn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My account was attacked so bad that it
probably almost got shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for whatever reason, people took that
as a challenge to get my shit shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was people or some person, like every
picture that was archived, like everything
[SPEAKER_02]: got reported.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what the fuck is going on
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I've already known for years,
like it's an important tool to have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry that we're in, but we're making a
conscious move to Twitter X because as
[SPEAKER_02]: disturbing as I find a lot of the shit on
that platform, at least I can post fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and talk about it and not get my
account taken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I feel like I'm moving
backwards to go forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I got my, I haven't used Twitter
in so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got my assistant, like I need you
to give me the crash course on how to use
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to start posting on it every
day and just blast weed porn on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on our Instagram, I want to fucking
want to see our new strain, follow us on
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't feel comfortable posting
what I feel like we should be able to post
[SPEAKER_02]: at this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use certain words.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use drop or fucking coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't imply that it's for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't expressly imply that it's for
sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly it's for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a legal commodity, especially in the
state of California and fucking damn more
[SPEAKER_02]: than half the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, follow us on Instagram,
TurtlePyCo.
[SPEAKER_02]: TurtlePyCoCA is our backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do post a little more weed on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a little more risks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a little more risks on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so yeah, TurtlePy45 on Twitter,
we're going to be as active as we can be
[SPEAKER_02]: on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in there posting content that we
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still doing content like I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some bacon yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a soup yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, keep it fluffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it goofy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Engaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made a fire ass pumpkin pie with real
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like bake the pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: See it on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: TurtlePyCo.
[SPEAKER_02]: TurtlePyCo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to try type out the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: TurtlePyCompany.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or because we're so shadow banned,
it won't come up either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the fucking Skittles got my heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so turned up for that weed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TurtlePy, have you ever had TurtlePy?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking the dessert, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're talking pies with turtle meat,
absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, we sponsored, it's funny you say,
we sponsored a reggae show on the Big
[SPEAKER_02]: Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great because they were like on the
radio station for like three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like sponsored by TurtlePyCo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like this one dude came out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, in his super Hawaiian accent
that I'm knocking a butcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, you guys put fucking
turtles in the pie?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's caramel, chocolate, pecans,
graham cracker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, the Tongans put turtles in pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't, okay, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely, no turtles were harmed in
the making of any of our pies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a shepherd pie with turtles.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love turtles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the turtle shit you guys send me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been cracking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for coming on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pop some of these fucking
seeds and have you check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to smoke some of these new
phenols with you.
