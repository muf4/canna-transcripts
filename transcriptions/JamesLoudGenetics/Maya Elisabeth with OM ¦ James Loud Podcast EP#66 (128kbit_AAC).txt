[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of the JamesLab
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, our special guest is Maya
Elizabeth from Ohm.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were actually on the hit list of the
people I really wanted to get on my show
[SPEAKER_02]: since the show started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's dive into some history.
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you get started in the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis and I have had a love affair
since I was probably about 14.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I started smoking every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time it was the early 2000s,
Prop 215 had just passed in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there were clubs popping up in
Berkeley and Oakland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I got my medical card just when I
turned 18.
[SPEAKER_06]: Third floor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Went to the third floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Patient ID Center on Lake San
Pablo that whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, just by the time it was starting
to become an option, I was just kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: flowed right into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was already making truffles and hard
candies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've made like everything infused over the
years and servicing the clubs and started
[SPEAKER_06]: an all-female collective called the Ohm
Grown Collective in 2008.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, and then went on to somehow get
the first permit for manufacturing in
[SPEAKER_06]: California in 2017.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest is history.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest is history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the edible game has changed so much in
the last 25, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, since 91, I've been smoking since
91.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since I would say 96, 97, it was the
same in 91 as it was in 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it kind of started with Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it started changing and people
started getting creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there was always like the
hippies that got creative on the lot at
[SPEAKER_02]: the dead shows and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd see some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's next level now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's milligram dosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting stuff that's safe and
sanitary and consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we never talked about milligrams
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, oh, here's a brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you never knew, I mean, oh,
it's a strong brownie or oh, it's a weak
[SPEAKER_02]: brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think weak back then was probably
100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything has really gotten refined if
that word fits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's wild because we measure these
invisible cannabinoids that turn from an
[SPEAKER_06]: acid, get converted and activated at a
certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we measure these invisible things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're allowed to be 10% over or 10%
under in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in Canada, you can only be 5% under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I thought, how Canadian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just this wild wormhole of
granular cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all changed so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the flowers changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To a degree, the flowers changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everything's changed and
everything will always change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that there's a lot of
people hating on the way it is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's still just as amazing in
a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a struggle for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we got to count our blessings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that less people in prison is a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everyone's had their expectations
and reality shattered of where we're at
[SPEAKER_06]: with legal cannabis by this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like six in one,
half a dozen in the other where the cards
[SPEAKER_06]: are a little stacked against you with all
those taxes and all the things that you
[SPEAKER_06]: have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beginning of legalization,
as far as recreational, there was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first people that had the most amount of
money got their licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially with flower, that didn't
necessarily mean that they had good
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That mean that they could get their
license and they had something on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was disappointing for me,
seeing all the flower that was not very
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could only get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has gradually gotten better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with extract too, I know like Absolute
Extract, Cannacraft, those guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're working with them, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys have been pushing the envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis has been pushing the envelope for
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Both Dennis and Ned are for sure pioneers
and trailblazers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trailblazers, pioneers, amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have great stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, there's not a lot of people
like the law was changed in Santa Rosa
[SPEAKER_02]: because of Dennis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's legendary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing having so many people
that are pioneers and revolutionaries in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're constantly evolving and
showing up and making change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us about Ohm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ohm is my company.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started Ohm in 2008.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we started as Ohm Edibles,
but we've made everything over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done like the holy anointing oil
from the Bible, all kinds of topicals,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of different tinctures, multi-herb
tinctures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we mostly focus on Epsom salts and
bath bombs, hydrotherapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also just re-released our gummies,
non-solvent gummy, pectin gummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've done everything over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a CBD side to our company and
we do like bulk CBD Epsom salts,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know, buckets, five and 10 pound
buckets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some body oils and a couple other balms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge fan of bath salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the kind you smoke, but Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a jacuzzi tub at the house and I'm
getting older and I get aches and pains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Epsom salt is absolutely one of the
best ways to help with inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's high in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it's magnesium salt,
but it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then adding something like cannabis,
full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just a big game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people, I think a lot of
people are unaware of the benefits,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as you get older, it's like,
there's little secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like, you know, magnesium could
alleviate 90% of people's ailments and
[SPEAKER_06]: woes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's best absorbed topically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Epsom salts are an affordable,
effective way to relieve pain and do
[SPEAKER_06]: literally a million other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Epsom salt does like a million things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It even strengthens your hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: It strips away shampoo buildup.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stops spasms.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes away eczema and psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes your dark circles go out from
your eyes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you sleep like a baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you have regularity in your
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wake up like charged up with like not
puffy and dehydrated, unlike alcohol,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I love like a glass of wine here and
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to demonize alcohol,
but like after a cannabis bath,
[SPEAKER_06]: you sleep like a baby and you,
you wake up actually moisturized and
[SPEAKER_06]: nourished and rested and like completely
like de-puffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hydrated.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, we take pharmaceutical salt,
pharmaceutical grade salt, Epsom salt,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we, um, we infused that with apricot
oil, avocado seed, jojoba and argon,
[SPEAKER_06]: which are like basically the heaviest of
the heady oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like sebum is what our skin secretes to
make scars go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's found only other place in nature
is jojoba oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these things are really good for your
face, for your skin, um, moisturizing oils
[SPEAKER_06]: that are all plant-based and of course,
full spectrum cannabis.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then therapeutic grade essential oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I blush when I say this, of course,
I'm literally five minutes in and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: about to drop my little bomb, but it's so
worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I watch people's light bulbs go off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's actually a concentration of
receptors in the womb space for women.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the colon is like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, unlike eating an edible or
taking a hit of weed, there's really no
[SPEAKER_06]: chance of a bad trip, but it's like very
sedating.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do everything a topical does,
but so much more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, like couples love them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they really like can just shift your
mood and take your worries away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like even in the witchy world,
salts hold negative energies and they cut
[SPEAKER_06]: energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like a lot of people who are healers
take a salt bath every night to cut
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone's energy from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even salt was like a preservative in
history or like secretly that's why,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got haters be gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, in like many, you know,
psychic people's place, you'll see a bowl
[SPEAKER_06]: of salt in the corner because it's
absorbing negative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, also, you know, cannabis, the
government patent is for neuroprotective
[SPEAKER_06]: properties as well as antioxidative
effects, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the antioxidants cancel free radicals,
which is what makes all wrinkles and
[SPEAKER_06]: illness.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like on top of that, it just
leaves your skin like shining and
[SPEAKER_06]: nourished and supple.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a beauty benefit and it's also
great for your hair.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, there's not really anything
these, these cannabis baths don't do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's my favorite consumption form
besides inhalation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They go together really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where'd you come up with it?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were on the garden, um, out on the
all female collective, literally back in
[SPEAKER_06]: like 2008 and my girl was super sore and
she was taking like whole bags of
[SPEAKER_06]: magnesium salt, like 10 pounds at a time
and dumping it in the tub.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because actually when you go to one of
those fancy soaking pools, it's really
[SPEAKER_06]: just 2000 pounds of Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can, it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can like take a whole huge amount
of it and dump it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had just made a fresh batch of olive
oil and she said, I'm going to go take an
[SPEAKER_06]: Epsom salt bath.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, so sore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, can I put some cannabis olive
oil in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she came out and she's like,
dude, I'm effed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: My body feels like a noodle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to like lay down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'm taking one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to see what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried and I was like, wow,
this is really a powerful effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so relaxing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like you hang out with a lot of,
you know, couples and maybe the guy or the
[SPEAKER_06]: girl is a really heavy consumer and the
other person is not the one who's the
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy consumer gets in is super relaxed,
has this wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one who has, you know, is cannabinoid
deficient, their body like sucks it up and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're, and they turn into a noodle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just so interesting kind of like
by soaking in it, your body will take what
[SPEAKER_06]: it needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you experimented with strain specific
using different genetics or do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: that pretty much across the board with the
cannabinoids, you're going to get the same
[SPEAKER_02]: results?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, so THC definitely makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, we have 10 pounds of Arnica
salt and we have some people that buy six
[SPEAKER_06]: of them at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think to myself, wow, this person is
dealing with chronic pain and these baths
[SPEAKER_06]: really must help.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the CBD ones are very effective as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does like translate well, but the THC
hits really different if you're into
[SPEAKER_06]: feeling sedated and relaxing, or maybe
you're dealing with anxiety or severe
[SPEAKER_06]: pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with them, you guys have done all
kinds of other stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles and you've won awards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're working with Whippy for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did, let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've done everything over the
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hundreds of thousands of hard candies,
you know, probably a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand peanut butter puffed rice
truffles throughout Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were really famous for those.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like, I don't know if you
remember Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I used to go get the five pounds of
organic peanut butter there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the go to get the puffed brown
rice and hand dip them in Belgian milk
[SPEAKER_06]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just so heady and strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like two for five bucks wholesale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't beat that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a total different era.
[SPEAKER_02]: $40 now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that wild?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, so yeah, now, now we do mostly
bath stuff, but we did, like I said,
[SPEAKER_06]: bring back our gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of all the things you've made,
what's your favorite besides the bath salt
[SPEAKER_02]: or besides the Epsom salt?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, I would be a draw, uh,
be the love bomb, which is like this all
[SPEAKER_06]: over topical slash lube that we make.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like five natural ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the love bomb or our gummies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went really far down the gummy wormhole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to get into it because I saw the
potential because I love gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the, you know, and gummies as far
as with cannabis in them, I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so appealing to everybody that
people that wouldn't normally smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: they see a gummy and they're like,
you know, like my mom, I could be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: mom, try this gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I'm not going to pass my mother a
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would never happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different ways you can
make a gummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make them vegan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to make them vegan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you know, there's, there's a
million different ways to make them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some really good ways and some
really bad ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, you know, when was the last
time you put a gummy that you didn't like
[SPEAKER_06]: in your mouth?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you might try another brand or flavor
of gummy, but you're not going to put that
[SPEAKER_06]: exact one back in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you really didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you start with your kind of
pate de fuit texture, more like a gelé.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you can get nice and firm and bouncy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something I'm really into.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to like talk back to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my gummy talks back, but she's pectin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she won't melt, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Won't melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: She'll hold its form.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not opposed to a gelatin gummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really not opposed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I just make pectin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the Haribo really necessarily
the hard ones where it's like a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they get stuck in your teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a Swedish fish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like Swedish fish, but I don't
like, like if, like, I like Swedish fish
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Swedish fish, but that doesn't talk
back.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't bounce back.
[SPEAKER_06]: To you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can go so granular down these gummy
wormholes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the potential for flavors that you
can put with gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can do teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do all kinds of Earl gray,
caramel meal with sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also blend those with berries
and all kinds of, I mean, it, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a choose your own adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's, I used to be a chef.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I get really excited about
talking about flavor combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many different flavor
combinations that work really well
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take something like a gummy
and you can do a million different flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a frozen little bite experience.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis wise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite thing to smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so I love dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a lot of non-solvents.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I judge the non-solvent category
for the Emerald cup every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rosin and bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosin and hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the most lovely time of year for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like having a little extra part-time
job at like, it's, you got a little,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, carve out a little time for
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it's a couple hour meetings and we
just wrapped that up actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's maybe my eighth year doing
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So who won?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I could tell you the number, but I don't
know the company cause it's actually
[SPEAKER_06]: blind.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So flower and hash are blind, but like
topicals and edibles are not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I find myself smoking a lot of hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam, I do the puff coat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's honestly, it's going to sound
terrible, but it's kind of like a little
[SPEAKER_06]: out of laziness, not, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Laziness maybe isn't the right word.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, my hands are always in
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that works for me cause I don't
have to sit down and commit a lot of time
[SPEAKER_06]: of heating my torch and all the
accoutrement that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, I love good flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought you, I brought some really nice
flower today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought some, some outdoor like East
coast diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I brought some indoor cereal milk from
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge ECSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you absolutely one of my favorites and
I have yet to see any ECSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as good as it was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me, I hope maybe I can be the person
who can bring that to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get the smell for sure on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just in these plastic bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plastic bags eat up the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat up the torch basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, this turns into all one bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's indoor cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the people who made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that turning all one bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's indoor, obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: You barely have to trim it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like such a beautiful strain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're both so fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can twist one for us if you want to try
any.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, see sticky test check.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can even like drop it and it barely
even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sour is I love sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you were talking about your flavor
track there, I was like, okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're, we're on the same track.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love chem dogs, sour diesel,
a lot of the old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, give me some GDP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the entries this year was a
straight up like six star hash made out of
[SPEAKER_06]: a nostalgic purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was freaking out over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, I was freaking out the most over
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, you guys, I was like,
you guys, are you like, well, no,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, no, there was that for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's white thorn.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was actual like purple Urkel hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, this was my comment in the section.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gave it almost a perfect score.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like glistening purple diamonds,
like the color of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, um, when we had weed like
this, we didn't have hash like this,
[SPEAKER_06]: which makes me a very lucky girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I got to go to time machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh my God, like someone went
to the past, picked up that nostalgic
[SPEAKER_06]: purple Urkel little silver tiny balls and
washed it into the nicest hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really special experience for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's totally awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially like those old school purples,
you know, it's like, I have not seen GDP
[SPEAKER_02]: in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the purple GDP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one grows it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I know why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the veg is, I used to, so I used to
grow it and it was, you know, veg for 31
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to, it also tests around
12%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this market is so percentage based,
you know, but, but you have a tummy ache.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to reach for that purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have access to it, it's the best
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll make you hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take your pain, make you hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good stuff and good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you know, we talk about
purple candy gas and it was purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was purple floral gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You take the tiniest pole.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get huge cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make you cough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call that expando.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look for that quality a lot,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, you know, when you're
judging hash, you smell this when I just,
[SPEAKER_06]: that I just broke up and it's so rubber
tire in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so yum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so yummy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like, this one's got the code for
my brain that I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to start off by smoking
some, some Z.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we live in an amazing,
amazing time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to experience really good flower
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it sounds like we're from the same
era where prop two 15 third floor,
[SPEAKER_02]: Harborside, BPG, a PCC in Berkeley off
telegraph and all the, all the traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody was traditional back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the guys that sold it to
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like they have license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And amazing flower, amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as good as today, in my opinion,
and more variety of genetics, I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: there was more diversity, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, yeah, there was way less strain
names, but there was the diversity was as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the hate, a lot more haze back
then, uh, a lot more hybrids too,
[SPEAKER_02]: that were distinct hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone gave me, um, you know,
a Jack Herrera cross do be the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, you know, I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can appreciate Jack Herrera,
but I know that's not like going to give
[SPEAKER_06]: me the effect I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that's not my medicine of choice,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, Oh, let me just try it for
like old time's sake.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, you know, kind of early.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody is always saying Jack
Herrera or Sativa.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually was a super flat down or high
for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Ooh, opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was so many, back in the day,
there was lots of different Jacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the Jack flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend CJ from high school,
his parents used to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, they brought this,
I believe they brought the seeds back from
[SPEAKER_02]: Densey seeds in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was Jack, like the Jack Herrera
is different than the Jack that I see
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very linear and very like,
uh, limonene and not a lot of complexity
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember the Jack back in the day,
having a lot of complexity and also would
[SPEAKER_02]: get you ripped.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever go to, um, Canada med care at
Polk and Sutter with the giant Buddha
[SPEAKER_06]: downstairs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I used to work there for a period
of time as a bud tender also.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was definitely an era.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were, I mean, we were paying 42 for
purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: 4200 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times were different back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Missed those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I mean, I think that just,
just the guys, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in a garage as opposed to growing
in a warehouse, you're putting more
[SPEAKER_02]: attention into those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are getting more per pound for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff that we got to see the
cat piss back in the day was like my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but sour and OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, dude, the OG was, you smoke it
down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's got that little hint of citrus,
but it was like gassy and not like chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like OG gassy, which is very
different to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll forever and always be an OG girl
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just love, love those gases more than
anything in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, to be honest with you,
the first thing to kind of like make a
[SPEAKER_06]: wave, I think since like cookies and the
gassy stuff has really been, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: white thorn rose to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't been a unique profile in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: So white thorn rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've, I think I've talked about on my
podcast before, but, uh, as far as what I
[SPEAKER_02]: love the effect of it and it's feel good
weed, it makes you feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so my friend Dave has this blue
13 cross that was like, uh, Louie the 13th
[SPEAKER_02]: for he got it from Jodri a wonderland
nursery back in the day and from Kevin
[SPEAKER_02]: Jodri.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he crossed it to his blueberry
haze and it is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes very different than white thorn
rose, but it has the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally has that same, like you
smoke it and you just feel really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that white thorn rose, if you smoke it
in extract, I got some from Bella heritage
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of her rosin and that stuff just
it's purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frigging tastes absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rosin pens, I've,
I've got rosin pens of it that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I don't want to share them with
anybody because it tastes so good and it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, that's a fun and you can
smoke that day, afternoon, evening,
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever, and it just makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is what changed my ethos in
breeding in the last two months because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been so fixated on flavor,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does, I'm constantly asking people how
it tastes instead of how it feels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that I'm on the wrong track
around four 20 when my friend passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now what we're doing is we're going
back to like, how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're going to prioritize that
a little bit more and flavor is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come along with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's a, it's a valid
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about medicine, even though
you're using it recreationally,
[SPEAKER_02]: how does it make you feel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when we use it recreationally,
I would just, point out that I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: still rooted in some type of wellness and
healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we pick our winners, you know,
for judging the Emerald Cup, I,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just noticed at least within myself,
you know, there's never, um, a hash that
[SPEAKER_06]: blows my mind for flavor that didn't also
blow my mind on nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes there's a great nose and not
a good flavor, but there's never an
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing flavor without flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of great nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing I have been able to
conclude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, so with Fido hunting,
sometimes the best ones are not the
[SPEAKER_02]: loudest ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a good nose, but what I've seen
across the board is sometimes the best
[SPEAKER_02]: ones aren't quite the loudest because
sometimes the loudest ones are the best
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittles is like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You squeeze it, you smell it, it's
amazing, it's loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of them are like more subtle on
the nose where you're like, ah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it smells pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like purple punch is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple punch has a great nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think when you squeeze the butt,
it smells pretty good, but then you smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it's a big letdown and it tastes
like cardboard turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one hit that might taste okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the rest of it just tastes kind
of bland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Charcoal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charcoal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're just smoking a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I'm not a huge fan of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want, I want it to taste down.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes good all the way to the roach or
when you fire it back up the next day,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, Whoa, that tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after you hit it, if the flavor
sits in your mouth uninterrupted until you
[SPEAKER_06]: interrupt it, you'll be tasting like
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, well with dabs too, like where
it's in your teeth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you could, uh, it could be half an
hour later and you kind of just move your
[SPEAKER_02]: mouth around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, Whoa, I still taste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still taste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I've been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so yummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually from, from last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, my girl from feeling frosty hash
washed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like kosher Skittles and a bunch of
OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have this new thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say it, like it really did make
a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I got the new heiress from,
uh, focus V.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's like an upgrade to a pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you get more of a real hit
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's portable and it can fit in my
pocket so I can like load it up and pick
[SPEAKER_02]: it around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tall and it has kind of like a round top,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, it's like a big fat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, dabs have come so far
from having to use hot knives and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, or charcoal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So chase the dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our mutual friends, uh,
Micah back in the day, we used to smoke on
[SPEAKER_02]: charcoal and you'd like the hookah
charcoal up and then drop it on there and
[SPEAKER_02]: have a tube and you'd hit it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chase the dragon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to set that up at the club for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was like the pre, that was
before we had dab rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we used to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had BHO and that's how we used to smoke
the BHO and we had butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yummy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's so talented.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're both so talented.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her and Madison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that flavor just sits in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally coats your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like stuff that's just very linear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's just blueberries or it's just
lemon or it's just orange, it doesn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, agent orange for the most part,
I've, I've tried a couple of different
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos of agent orange over the years,
but agent orange, you know, from sub cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that was very linear to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to house of cultivar in
Washington and they had some agent orange
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like the most amazing complex,
like hits on all these levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a huge play in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, it's like, and I'm not a
huge orange turp guy, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like everything in, in the right moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I even like blue dreams from time to time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're around 15 years ago,
you got to see really amazing blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: When there was like that little like trend
going around where people were trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: put down blue dream.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, first of all, it's weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they still hate on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And second of all, I guess you weren't in
prop two 15 when it was really cracking
[SPEAKER_06]: then, cause we were making lots of
progress and success with blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before everybody had it, it was the
thing to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in high demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can blame it Rosenthal and a
couple other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: They bashed it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they released the clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was that maybe it wasn't,
but Ed did sell clones back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he sold a lot of clones,
but yeah, blue dream, as soon as it got
[SPEAKER_02]: out, everybody shared it with everybody
yielded so much and everybody wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made you look like a good girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want, and I would use to tell
people beginner growers, you should grow
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going for the first time,
don't grow OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause even though you love smoking OG,
grow blue dream, see how you do with blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I mean, I used to love growing
and it was the first thing I got over two
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds that in sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get two pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were like, ah, I get four
pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, back in the day, two pounds,
like if you hit two pounds, everyone else
[SPEAKER_02]: was getting one and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue dream does make people look like good
growers because it's like kind of blue and
[SPEAKER_06]: silver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that not too many hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you feel really good about yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It finishes and it's chunky and it's,
you know, the cut that used to go around
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's, I think there's a lot of S
ones that have floated around since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of the people that have
cuts now have S ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a handful of people that
still have the real deal, but I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the flower that's like,
the same stuff that we had that was like
[SPEAKER_02]: super sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was, it was, um,
it's, as far as like structure and vigor
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and a lot of the boxes that are to be
checked, it was the apical of all of them
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would open a pound bag,
a turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open that back in the day and it was
like, wow, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if it was the first time you
ever saw it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that NAFQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you remember.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I remember Afghan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the sweet AFQ was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I saw it, I was like,
this is fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way that there could be this
much sugar on a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always saw that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always smell, uh, almost like a bread
dough, a yeasty bread dough on Afghan goo.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good medicine strain too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looked just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my friends used to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like they had sprinkled
trichomes on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, there's no way this is
real.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember the old school like hash plant
that was all garlicky smell like onions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't terpy necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was kind of bland as far as
terpenes go, but it did smell savory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like savory and it was like super
mild.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it was almost GMO harsh.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how flat GMO can be like almost
like Hershey hollow non-milky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Donnie burger, GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how that's evolved into the extract
scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like heavy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like garlic hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Marlon went through this phase
after like he was an OG head and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: all he wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lawyer back in the day and I had
Marlon and those two people, all they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to smoke was OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like literally Marlon was like,
where's the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be the OG guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met Marlon Asher back in the
day was from OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then he went on this GMO kick and
that GMO kick lasted a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, GMO is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer sour, but more stimulating,
more stimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff would, you know,
you would be high super in the extract to
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs of GMO done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love a good sour diesel myself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like some people,
it gives them like the couch lock for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me productive, but it makes me,
it's another one that makes me feel right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, all those chems, I feel like the
chems, the gassy chems were always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, OGs too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about the state of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about everything that's
going on right now with cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: California?
[SPEAKER_06]: When I look at the cannabis space right
now, I see opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me a minute to come back to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my little, you know, moment in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my time out, even though it wasn't
ever really a time out, but you know what
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, there was a time where it was
like, what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I feel like we're so new to the
whole industry is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's, there's no balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no solid foundation with
everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, it's, it's this time where it's like,
what's happening next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be very scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're, you know, we're here in
California and watching New York at their
[SPEAKER_06]: wave and, you know, it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, gosh, there were, you know,
remember when all that Canadian money was
[SPEAKER_06]: around and all the LPs coming down,
buying everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was so fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was like, I kind of feel like the
way Ohm played it was like, we didn't take
[SPEAKER_06]: on, you know, too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so here we are these years later,
like still totally like chugging along,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but it's, we've switched
distributions a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've switched manufacturers a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's been rough out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I, if I wasn't completely in love
with weed, I definitely would have given
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it's one of those things where
it's like, you can't see yourself giving
[SPEAKER_06]: up, you know, so you just gotta keep
fighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just totally still here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just shifted my perspective and
it feels really good to kind of like shift
[SPEAKER_06]: my expectations a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause when I step back and take,
take what I thought I was going to get out
[SPEAKER_06]: of there, I'm actually really blessed,
you know, and lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like people use our products.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we, every month people use our
bath products and they bring people
[SPEAKER_06]: relief.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I came for that juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I came for that juice and that
nectar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gratitude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am grateful, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, cannabis is a female
spirit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like water is a female spirit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, can you find anywhere in nature
where there's a 90 degree angle in a body
[SPEAKER_06]: of water?
[SPEAKER_06]: No river or lake has a corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so we take water and we put it
in these 90 degree angle pipes,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're kind of like changing the
programming of this like energy,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of feel like that's what we did
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We took it from like the feminine,
the open, the free, cause like cannabis is
[SPEAKER_06]: this forever giving generous plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you use the scraps and then you can
like use the scraps again, and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: can use the roots and the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just this ever giving
non-discriminatory, like compassionate,
[SPEAKER_06]: ever giving thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: That she doesn't want you to weigh her
before you throw her away and block your
[SPEAKER_06]: flow because you have to track every bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: She says, there's more than enough of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just take me, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the spirit of that plant,
kind of shoving it into this 90 degree
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, there was always this disharmony,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can feel that cause I'm on the super
feminine side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, as, as crazy as it sounds,
I, there was a part of me that had to
[SPEAKER_06]: disassociate a long time ago, like seven
years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and now I just see it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, we do CBD, like we do all kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always forever make medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I make Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'll always forever be a medicine
maker doing it my own way, as well as,
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as this like compliant market,
because we've come so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why would I give up now?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't see that, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once my reality came to reality,
I understood that, you know, there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: one coming to save me.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no one coming to save us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This industry is challenged and most other
people probably would have given up,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like sometimes if I feel like I'm
going backwards, it's like, no,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually you're still going forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a spiral because, you know,
what looks like success today is very
[SPEAKER_06]: different from what I thought I would have
been getting five years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the, all, all that to say this,
I feel grateful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand everything now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually let our permit go.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the first one in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: We decided to let ours go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we were at a crossroad.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, okay, we're good at
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've scored a hundred on our tests.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we did all the things, you know,
we had the standalone building in
[SPEAKER_06]: Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's how we got the first one
is Berkeley led us through.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, but you have to realize with that
comes managing employees, workers comp,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of robbery started happening,
you know, you might be following the rules
[SPEAKER_06]: with security.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it could be easy to still break in,
you know, we're a bunch of girls.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of found myself at a crossroad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I could pick up other brands to
manufacture for and like really be a
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturer, you know, or I can just
focus on being a brand and work with a
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we decided to actually do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, I actually, I, I don't feel like
I made the wrong decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, everything still takes work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like when you choose that route,
your work is done as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really not like that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you're still doing all the
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, um, I will say that a lot of
people think people in cannabis are just
[SPEAKER_06]: like living some sloppy, easy life,
you know, and it's a grind.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a break more than anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all my poor cannabis friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, bro, you need a vacation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we need to, we've been saying it's
not boss girl.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's moss girl summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like really time to kick it back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, these hamster wheels go on
forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're wheels they they're made to spin
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like sometimes you need to jump
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need to get perspective is
relentless.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I want to, I want to get more
for doing less at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you hop into these vibrational
hacks, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where all the money in the world is
already out there and it's a frequency.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, how do I tap into that station
and like just divert it over here for like
[SPEAKER_06]: really doing less or like, or like,
what would I do with my time for free?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, how can I figure out a way to like
make abundance out of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so just a lot, a lot of
shifting, um, a lot of shifting in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of, you know, like everybody we've been
going through rapid growth these last 10
[SPEAKER_06]: years for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much shifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been wild and it's not stable by any
means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has a long ways to go before the
market stabilizes, but we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the light of the tunnel is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's there and I can see it and I'm
still going to just put one foot in front
[SPEAKER_02]: of the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, uh, what you said really
resonates with me that nobody is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come save you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really got to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like the way the laws are
written, change them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or make effort towards that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like your business is failing,
do whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you sometimes you just got to
suck it up and do, you know, wake up the
[SPEAKER_02]: next day and do the best you can do and go
one more day and live one day at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another good example, like everyone's
talking about this recent law that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about passing, you know,
this federal legalization or
[SPEAKER_06]: decriminalization, whatever, you know,
and, and it's like, okay, I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can choose the fear factor timeline,
or you can understand that like this plant
[SPEAKER_06]: has a gravitational pull and like when
you're with her and in alignment,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the doors just seem to open.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like trust your flow that there's going
to be a place for you, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: not everybody that's going to come here is
going to be monsters.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be good people
everywhere, just like everywhere in life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just got to trust that we'll get in
where we fit in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you take away your ego and allow
yourself to be driven by passion,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where you're going to win,
especially with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and if you love the plant,
like I love the plant, like you love the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, you're going to be successful and
you're going to pivot or you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do whatever it takes to be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, I'm just so grateful that
I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so grateful that I get to have this
podcast, that I get to interview people
[SPEAKER_02]: like yourself and that we get to talk
about cannabis and we're recording the
[SPEAKER_02]: oral history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just so amazing, 2024,
like 2024.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just amazing that we're able to
be in this industry that's growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: evolving so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like surfing a really,
really, really big wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love surfing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for the right people, this is a
time of opportunity and excitement.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of opportunity out there and
it can be scary, but there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, whether it's genetics,
I mean, there's the fear factor you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about though.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people with that fear
factor, like, oh, you know, I'm,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is only going to happen for another
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're still here now, just keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously at this point, just keep going
and keep on fighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that I'm not into flower
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad I'm on the genetic side of it
because I think those people have it worse
[SPEAKER_02]: than anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: The price keeps dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got guys that are able to
get their costs lower, so they're charging
[SPEAKER_02]: less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just charging less for better
quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every year the product gets cheaper
and better quality for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's real tough being a cultivator
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel for those guys out there on the
commercial level and people that have
[SPEAKER_02]: invested their whole life into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, what do I do now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's other things in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I love the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's amazing being able to cross
breed so many different things and now
[SPEAKER_02]: taking a step back and looking at what my
goals are and what do we want for the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do I want to leave as my legacy for,
especially for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is my legacy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wrote a book, so that's great,
but it's more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the genetic side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like now that I'm older,
I can really kind of focus on like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, what am I leaving behind for
everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant is beautiful like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you put in, it gives back to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got like a really awesome veggie garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year I try to have a veggie garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I can't imagine my life without one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this year it's just knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just so awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Homegrown vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, whether it's tomato,
you just can't get that kind of stuff from
[SPEAKER_02]: the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also that you put the love into
that plant and you put the time and
[SPEAKER_02]: energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has your energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're eating a by-product of your
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just so amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also like, there's cannabis laden
throughout the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's just, it's all interwoven
exactly where it should be amongst the
[SPEAKER_06]: lavender and the chamomile and the chard
and the kale and the watermelons and the
[SPEAKER_06]: pumpkins and the zucchinis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're all together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love having my son witness all of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a three-year-old and he's learning
where his food comes from and we get to go
[SPEAKER_06]: out there and we're lucky enough to pull
something from the garden pretty much
[SPEAKER_06]: every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just having cannabis plants around
just raises the vibration.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like feels so good to be around those
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the most iconic leaf in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go anywhere in the world and draw
that leaf and most likely make a friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're going to get you some
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get high together and
you're going to have a lifelong friend,
[SPEAKER_06]: even if you don't speak the same language.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like such a friendship herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, food and cannabis are the two
things that really bring people together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an unspoken language.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone was like, so what do you like do
for fun?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like weed and restaurants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, and make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think making money is fun because I'm
kind of an abundance, like manifestation
[SPEAKER_06]: type of junkie a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always playing with the energies in the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you know, we're doing this dance and
it's whatever you make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, um, well yeah, those are my fun
activities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything revolves around those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like going to cannabis events and eating
good food at the cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, yeah, I love
spandibus for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the European events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Mexico city in October,
first part of October and cannabis people
[SPEAKER_02]: in all these countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quality is getting like Mexico
city blew my mind last time I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality and the people are so
passionate about weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very much like it was in
California in 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have little, some little social
clubs there in Mexico city?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like association type groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where like they're growers and they all
share their weed and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have meetings and they talk about
their stuff and they smoke and they share
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed and share genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're super passionate about
California genetics and U S genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these guys are doing breeding fat
budstard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a, he's a breeder down there and he
does some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Santa Rosa green seeds there in Santa
Rosa as well in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the people are just so
passionate and even extract they're into
[SPEAKER_02]: like making good extract and they love
talking about it as much as I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm one of those people I can talk for
hours and hours and hours around food and
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so amazing.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, um, speaking of food, I'm like,
I'm actually doing a women's, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: event coming up and I'm cooking all the
food myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a classically trained chef,
but I'm definitely a kitchen witchy mama.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, I definitely feed people as my love
language.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for years I've been like playing with
this event in my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, it's an honoring of women
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an intentional, uh, like clever
menu with a hash pairing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For each course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so like, yeah, we're going to smoke
our weed and eat our food instead of
[SPEAKER_06]: eating the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm not really into the whole
eating the weed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's great for at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved that for at home and maybe once in
a while, like someone has an infusion
[SPEAKER_02]: dinner, whatever that's cool for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, I want to smoke my weed and eat my
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love amazing food and I love amazing
weed and paired together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be absolutely amazing,
but just the whole thing where you want
[SPEAKER_02]: some turps and some, you know,
10 milligrams, but I feel like if you eat
[SPEAKER_02]: it with the course, I want to feel it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to feel it after I'm done
eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, Oh, I feel great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to worry about getting home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also like, I love wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like good wine, good alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like cocktails, but, but I'm not really
drinking very much right now, but I
[SPEAKER_02]: really, I love the social aspect of all of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like especially cannabis with people that
like food, like that's a great one where
[SPEAKER_02]: you can talk about good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's so many good restaurants out
there and there's restaurants everywhere
[SPEAKER_02]: in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it doesn't matter where you go,
there's good restaurants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like there's good restaurants
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know where to look, I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, anyone who wants to have a
restaurant should find a way to let people
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke weed because we'll order like three
times as much, you know, better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we smoking here?
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, um, some cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really yummy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like cereal milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one, there's some different
phenos of it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's got to be expand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's got to be smooth.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's not smooth, I don't want to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing I like about really good
cereal milk is it's creamy and it's gassy
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's got a little candy floral in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's so it checks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, so, so with all the modern
cannabis, these gelato crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I think they're all trying to be
really good cereal milk, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I mean, I like a good gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a good runs, you know, all these
things that are whatever you want to call
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them white runs, pink runs,
all these things when they're done proper
[SPEAKER_02]: and they burn white and they just taste
good down to the roach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I like Hayes too though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So super silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some more Hawken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you these plants when you leave,
but we got well Hawken times Malawi and
[SPEAKER_02]: these things smell great when you do the
stem rub on them and they're veg about
[SPEAKER_02]: five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about to go outdoor and I'm going
to make some seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, the stem rub on them is like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite candy, but it's sweet,
like citrusy sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smells hazy where you get with the
haze, but like funky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of those ones that makes me
feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like red Congo and Malawi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the high always really strong red
Congo makes me feel good and happy and
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Durbin just kicks my head in the
dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't talk or I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, and it doesn't have a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those, all the strains, all those
different African genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like they don't have a ceiling to
where you can keep smoking them and you
[SPEAKER_02]: get higher and higher skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a line here and it just
doesn't get me higher than this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get me high, but it doesn't get me
higher than this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where some of those equatorial longer
flowering ones, you smoke them and they
[SPEAKER_02]: just keep getting you more high,
more high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke them for hours and you're
still going to get more high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gone like super deep on those,
but I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of people here growing
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly because they take so long and
they're so tall and they're so tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a specific type of room and the
genetics are rare and the people don't
[SPEAKER_02]: share the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you could probably get
seeds of them fairly easy on the internet,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll hunt your own, but people are
lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because the seeds are out there,
the ACE genetics, they sell some good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can search all over the internet and
find pretty good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aladdin from Khalifa genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sells really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land race varietals.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, says hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Josh and Kelly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're amazing people.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're my dear friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were together on the connect
community event in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has an opinion and she's very
well-spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to get her on my podcast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like we hit it off there and then
she's, I mean, I have no problem in
[SPEAKER_02]: debating stuff and some people don't like
debating, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm willing to debate stuff,
how I feel about stuff and I'm okay that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a different, a difference of
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's great when we can have
two differences of opinion, talk about it
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe I'll see your side a little and
you'll see a little bit of my side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're like, okay, well,
this is how it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, I'm okay with trying to
change people's minds and also having
[SPEAKER_02]: people change my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so not a lot of people these days are
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like in the last 10 years,
people have become so soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to hear another opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, no, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we missed the good old debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you have a debate with her?
[SPEAKER_02]: We, well, we were talking about the divas
and genetics and, uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it, and it was just, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like no bad vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were able to just speak like civilized
people and say each other's side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think she gets the whole passion for
the sacred plant thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think not everybody does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people it's, it's either over their
head or they're not into that or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like, I'm always about the sacred
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the plant has given so
much to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the reason I'm here is because of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've put a lot into it,
but I've got a lot, I've got more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've got more.
[SPEAKER_02]: More out of it than I've put into it a lot
of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just so grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy that, you know, we could do the
things that we've done and end up here now
[SPEAKER_02]: in the present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the president's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So still cool cannabis events,
high times, you know, it's like the high
[SPEAKER_02]: times went away and people are like,
Oh, cannabis events are done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, they just started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald cup's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: August 18th.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's like Emerald cup and,
uh, Boston freedom rallies coming up in
[SPEAKER_02]: September.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to go to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty cool event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been, but I'd like to check it
out someday too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, hemp fest has always
been amazing up in Seattle, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't been doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know events got hit really hard,
you know, with the whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And funding for events and like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just people low turnout after everyone
getting so scared.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, um, you know,
Kelly and I have been working,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, doing some really special work,
uh, with, um, uh, plant medicine actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like blessing up people's lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, um, it's so new.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't really have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, single ingredient plant medicine comes
from cloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beyond cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like bring me back to the juice I came for
with cannabis, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Miracles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she gave me some hash that was like
super, super amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some of the best hash I smoked this
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talking about effect and going back to
effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You feel that energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just feel that energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, those are the kinds of
things that have brought me back to what
[SPEAKER_02]: am I doing breeding for flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the way we taste, but like,
let's make some feel good weed again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, theirs doesn't lack flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all, but it has a noticeable
feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that some of the stuff that,
uh, you know, it's like, they all have
[SPEAKER_02]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has a slightly different
effect, but the feel good weed from white
[SPEAKER_02]: thorn rose and blue 13 is like,
it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a, it's, you couldn't categorize
it as a stimulant or as a narcotic,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in the middle, but it makes you
feel great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly sedative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Slightly, but like, I say stimulating and
sedating.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I like about Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stimulating.
[SPEAKER_06]: My brain's going, but my body's kicked
back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've seen a lot of different OG
Kush's over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was that Diablo OG that was coming
from Petaluma.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like Sonoma OG from those areas
that were just so good in SFV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love SFV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also like, you know, Khalifa Kush and the
Flowrider OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's, so, so that Flowrider,
the, the original, the triangle Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that was like the lime green,
bigger buds, really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a little bit different of a high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all kind of did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the Kush's can be heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the Kush's can definitely be
heavier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those highs can be a little flat
for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't appreciate a flat high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want a stimulating aspect to it or
else I'm just going to get tie-tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love pine needles when you can
smoke and you taste the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's something to be said
about smoking the forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could, I could talk about Kush literally
all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, those OG's had different
levels of earth and so basically earth
[SPEAKER_02]: citrus and pine needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could get some that were really
piney and some that were like just a
[SPEAKER_02]: little piney.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some that were super earthy and
some that were mild in the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some that were real heavy in that
citrus, in that citrus, like sativa-ish
[SPEAKER_02]: uplifting kind of high.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like those ones kind of getting more
into the sour diesel-y vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like those stimulating sours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stimulating sours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this weed's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that nice?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from the guy that made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was the guy that made it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kenny Powers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from him and one of his work
partners, Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do good work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower looks amazing and it's chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried the Pluto?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's to be debated, but it's definitely
a gelato times a cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've heard different iterations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticky Farms up in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Casey and those guys were doing
it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Pluto was something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got real big and it was really
like, it checked all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like floral candy, purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoked good down to the rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bag of peel was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dark purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying all my little trigger words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Special.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like gassy floral candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one where it's like you smoke
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, ah, I might smoke another.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do bong rips.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't do just one.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I really appreciate
about, you know, a lot of the hashes are
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them are a lot, you know,
live.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them are live.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of those like tuba rose,
Hawaiian flower, really refined floral
[SPEAKER_06]: notes can kind of only be captured when
the plants alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they come in late at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all swelled up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They chop it at an element of surprise,
put it right on ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of those jars can capture,
you know, stuff that you don't get any
[SPEAKER_02]: other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very volatile, easy to disrupt.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very subtle anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only can be found in fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the first to go when you dry your
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your opinion on like a BHO,
like live resin versus rosin?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so I, it's funny when you were
talking, it was, you were basically
[SPEAKER_06]: saying, exactly what I say, which is if
it's like really good, I'll, I'll enjoy
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I, I'll smoke a BHO if it's done
right and purged properly, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so yeah, it's, it's, um, I can
appreciate good work anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if I were like, this is always my
filter of like desert Island, five
[SPEAKER_06]: strains, you know, what are you going to
bring on a desert Island for the rest of
[SPEAKER_06]: your life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's not going to be a BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your five for as far as flavor
strains?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in no particular order, skittles,
you know, it's some skittles variant for
[SPEAKER_06]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably white thorn rose variant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something really up and gassy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like diesel-y, you know,
for sure that I'm at three.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely want a nostalgic old school
purple.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, for my fifth one,
um, I'll probably just go with,
[SPEAKER_06]: honestly, like a straight up cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cookies is stimulating and sedating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think people have,
it's funny how fast we forget,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's people that are like,
eh, cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no cookies in 2010.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in everything for one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2010, that was the one to have like
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was top shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely bready.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like bready and gassy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he barely had to trim it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just silver little silver balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that we had never, like the first
one that we had didn't yield, had terrible
[SPEAKER_02]: nose spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like spaghetti over just like OG,
like back in the day that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the smoke of it was like, you're
smoking something that's special.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, definitely like a little bit
of musk and a little bit of bread and a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was multi-layered.
[SPEAKER_06]: That top pissy, top lingering pissy note.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so distinct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're in a hot boxed concert and
somebody lights up a joint of cookies and
[SPEAKER_06]: it like literally grabs your nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it has one top note of Durbin piss
above all the others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go, who's smoking that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what you find in everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what people love.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what brings the smoothness,
you know, the gassiness, that top note.
[SPEAKER_06]: So distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, yeah, for all that stuff,
it's like the, the bread that's in wedding
[SPEAKER_06]: cake is like, yeah, people, people are
quick to forget, but I don't forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, cookies has a special place in my
heart because I was like there for all
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, yeah, I was growing cookies and
pink panties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at, you know, the little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool though, when you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used to, I used to grow pink panties
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would get blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant was black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clones were purple stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing, Sunset Sherbrooke,
but the, the, you know, as a parent to
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunset Sherbrooke or whatever,
the cut that we had of pink panties,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have jars of just purple stemmed clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before cookies, there was really just,
OG was the queen of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and cookies was the first
cannabis strain to really change the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, there was so, so for me,
I remember the Bubba and the master and
[SPEAKER_02]: the OG, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was the Bubba Kush and that was
the top shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like, we didn't call it pre-98.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was the master Kush and it
grew really strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grew like fingery and it grew like
sideways.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was probably my lesser favorite of
the two, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Hindu, the Hindu from back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that was first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bubba was so soapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like Irish springs in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally was soapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever have a Sen Sen candy?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it's like a Chinese candy that
like literally tastes like soap.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like so Sen Sen vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba was, that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like straight soap and that's how
you could recognize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is it grew, I like the
way it grows, but if you showed me a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture, I could be like, yeah,
that's Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so distinct the way that it grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like shorter and the way that
the, the leaves actually the, the pointed
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves, they don't have serrations on them
and they kind of fold up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would still put, I would still put
Girl Scout cookies above all of those,
[SPEAKER_06]: but neck, a tie and same level as straight
OG for me, for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I like all those variants,
but they weren't, you know, I love the SFV
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Josh DOG.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those two are like my jam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like SFV for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, our, whatever you want.
Pine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: SFV.
[SPEAKER_06]: SFV is the pineist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, I want diesels.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I love about that pine
needle is like you, you smoke it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're smoking it down to the roads and
every time you blow it out, you just taste
[SPEAKER_05]: the forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pine needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Josh Freeman, he's from Sebastopol.
[SPEAKER_02]: He taught me that you can eat pine
needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that they're really high in
vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you eat the baby pine needles as
they're freshly growing, they taste
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, fuck, that tastes just like
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first thing I thought of when
I had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to give that a try sometime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fresh growth from the pine needles,
it's like redwood or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to give that a try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to remind, it's a reminder of
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could drink and eat OG Kush actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: So well, back in the day we used to make
this, um, I learned a lot like over these
[SPEAKER_06]: years being self-taught.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like one of the things was that,
that actually glycerin is really not a
[SPEAKER_06]: good solvent for cannabinoids,
but it's an excellent solvent for
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, making tinctures the old
school way through glycerin, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: with all these different, you know,
strain specific batches really left you
[SPEAKER_06]: with like essentially a liquid flower,
you know, like a liquid version of,
[SPEAKER_06]: of the flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was such a good capture of terpenes,
but, but not a good capture of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
Very.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not healthy for you to smoke in your
pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were making like spritzers and stuff
like Kush sodas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so interesting because it wouldn't
really get you high, but it would make
[SPEAKER_06]: your face start to sweat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there was something going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like have you ever had a high terpene
experience where your face kind of gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: little flushed?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was doing that is so weird because it
all lines up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Oh my God, I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is truly a capture of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really, you know, I guess kind of
an accident.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to make something very
strong, but it was only strong in
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the, the version 1.0 pens all
had, they use glycerin and they combine it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was just so bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, just not meant to be smoked like
that really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the industry has just come so
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at pens and now we have, now we have
puffco's and we have aerosols and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these cool things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, so my girl, Frosty, she like
hooked it up with this like special
[SPEAKER_06]: attachment or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't realize I like, wasn't even
living my best life without it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she had to like put it in the app
and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's like a counter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, this is like the new color I've
had it maybe like two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyways, I had taken over 2000 dabs
with it so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, wow, if I had this piece,
I would probably like have taken a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: less because it makes it so much more dab
like I'm wasting my money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the future, we used to have the
volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love volcano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I figured out that you need one
bag per flavor and it's better,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you just keep reusing it for that same
flavor, it's better than mixing them all
[SPEAKER_02]: and they all end up tasting the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat piss back in the day was my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: The champagne was good too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I remember the champagne.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the cat piss for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually speaking of volcano bags,
we used to run a volcano bag across this
[SPEAKER_06]: whole thing at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 foot long volcano bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone would just be sharing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pre-COVID.
[SPEAKER_06]: We weren't afraid to share and you do it
for a hit of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: People weren't afraid of dabs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you would do it for, it was worth it
for the hit of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't even think about that kind of
stuff though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were like really living life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's like, oh, I need hand
sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause like I'm up in like, I said
Sebastopol now and I just literally like
[SPEAKER_06]: today saw two people biking like on a
country road wearing masks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just no one around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people by themselves in a car
with the windows rolled up wearing a mask
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, okay, well maybe they have
COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I always think too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I guess they must have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just don't think it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wouldn't be biking on a hot summer
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 100 degrees out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine you're biking with all
your hot breath, just pressing on your
[SPEAKER_06]: face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're getting your lungs
stronger, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we live in a strange world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a really strange world when there's
just so many different realities going on
[SPEAKER_06]: at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everyone's got their own reality,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different perceptions of what
reality is coming from different people
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to understand people from an
outside perspective, instead of looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: just them straight on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it makes me able to think of
stuff from a different perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that's why some people
really can't smoke cannabis is maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: they're not ready to look at themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite Bob Marley quote is when you
smoke the herb, you reveal yourself to
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all been in the situation where you
get in a little tiff with your friend,
[SPEAKER_06]: you smoke a little weed and you're like,
wow, I was out of line back there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does show you the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why personally for me,
that's one of my tools, but I always know
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to flip my mind after I smoke on
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, The Matrix is just these tightly
bundled belief systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: An example is we all agree that we stop at
red lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you break that belief, you can go
to jail or even worse, hurt someone.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everyone's going to think you're crazy
because you run a red light.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very tight bundle of beliefs
around traffic rules and safety in our
[SPEAKER_06]: society.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we all agree to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was a point where a lot of
people, more than half the population,
[SPEAKER_02]: agreed that cannabis was bad for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's so strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was the reality back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, cannabis is bad,
reefer badness, all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: misinformation and miseducation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so strange that we went that
direction with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think we've probably been using it,
not even probably, we've been using it for
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of years as medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just in the last, since the 30s
and 40s, they started making it look bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, such a cure all.
[SPEAKER_06]: They demonize.
[SPEAKER_06]: It grows like a weed in our backyard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cannabis can do what what.
[SPEAKER_06]: White willow bark does and chamomile and
lavender and calendula.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they can't all do what cannabis does.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis does what 100 plants do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it grows like a weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's their nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no profit in it for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they tax it so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we have the majority at least
agreeing that it should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think big steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little steps over time that have turned
into big steps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like two two things that really
help people change their mind is either
[SPEAKER_06]: personally experiencing a cannabis miracle
or witnessing someone they care about
[SPEAKER_06]: receiving a cannabis miracle, you know,
or benefit from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this time, it's seeded out enough
that I think, you know, with six degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: of separation, people have been in touch
with these cannabis miracles and seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: what these plants what this plant can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: For totally straight edge people that were
really even opposed to trying it
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like, you know, we don't have a
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that we don't have the right to
tell people as long as they're not hurting
[SPEAKER_02]: other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of plant medicine is good or bad
for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should be allowed to do as long
as you're not hurting anybody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we have more than 200
cannabinoid receptors in our body.
[SPEAKER_06]: You only have eight opioid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they start under your tongue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sublingual tincture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was, God forbid, on my deathbed,
I would hope that I might have a receptor
[SPEAKER_06]: for the medicine you may place in my mouth
under my tongue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not saying put this here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so for in my in my personal
opinion, I think it's our our birthright.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty clearly clear to see that it's
a tool that's been given to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: To use to be well, you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it should be everybody's
option, whether you want to do it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, you know, I'm not one to judge
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, it's one of those things that it
only makes the world a better place,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hungry, happy, rested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Side effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, alcohol, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny thing with alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do a lot more bad than they do
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone has their own opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my opinion is that they do worse than
or they do they do more bad than good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've definitely seen many people destroy
them their lives from alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've had my own little dances
with drinking too much and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they call it spirit for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and trust me, I love a little glass of
wine here and there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to put it down to bring
cannabis up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but it's a really different vibration
as far of a as far on the other side of
[SPEAKER_06]: the vibration spectrum as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was talking about this at a Dead
in Company show a while back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was because you could see the
vibration that people were on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that were smoking weed or or
whatever, tripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the people that were drinking had
a completely different vibration.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is alcohol tunes you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And psychedelics, they tune you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they hyper you're able to hyper focus
or focus more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all need to be tuned in a
little bit more especially with music and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes tuned out of this norm that we
have and into the, you know, on the right
[SPEAKER_02]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like really speaking my language.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, with this time, 2024,
you know, it's not like a time we've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's never going to go back to
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it's this time where,
you know, if you don't have a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of a meditation process where any way that
you're going in and connecting with your
[SPEAKER_06]: own soul.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going to feel rougher and
rougher.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for me, I'm a spiritual person.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in great spirit, you know,
and if I didn't have that connection to
[SPEAKER_06]: great spirit and the faith that,
you know, the things that I believe that
[SPEAKER_06]: the universe has my back and frequencies
and vibrations matter and all the things I
[SPEAKER_06]: really my what my little web of beliefs,
you know, then I would feel way more lost
[SPEAKER_06]: than I do already when everybody's feeling
lost on some measure, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the thing is, we spend so much time and
technology that like you're kind of tuning
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself into the vibration of AI by being
on your phone all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do way too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: They we use them for cameras, calendars,
like everything we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start getting hive minded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, you're tuning into your
cell phone over and over again,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're getting on that AI vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the truth is we're actually nature
spirits, you know, where people were
[SPEAKER_06]: humans of nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people need to ground themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you go and lay on the ground,
like find a nice spot that feels good to
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the grass, take your shoes off,
flip yourself like a pancake, at least 20
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes on each side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your phone as far away from you as
possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter if it's sun or shade,
wherever you're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I do that, I can feel the problems
pulling off of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just like gravity pulls it off of me
right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's it's like a spa day and like some
really effective therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a whole bunch of other good things all
wrapped into one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get up just feeling like,
you know, a new person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go do gardening with your shoes off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're able to spend time in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do cold plunging too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea of cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that everybody should try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's so good for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the part of my brain is very
small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard how it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's a part of your brain that,
you know, grows when you make yourself do
[SPEAKER_06]: things you don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the cold plunging literally grows this
part of your brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently undisciplined people have
like this very small part of this brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I bet mine is like so pinner
because I'm a lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to be comfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting into a cold pool sounds like so
awful to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: To force yourself to get in freezing cold
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to the extremes where I went
down to 37 degrees and now I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything below 55, you get really good
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like in the high 40s, low 50s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a great replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: For coffee in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to also just get a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's hard to be upset after you
get out of cold plunging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're so focused on in the,
it really, the thing is that it brings you
[SPEAKER_02]: into the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we need to do that a lot more
than what we typically do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're thinking about the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're thinking about the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can once a day, just get in
some cold water or meditate or do whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: it is and then go into the present,
you start realizing that the reality is
[SPEAKER_02]: different than you probably had the
perspective for before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's really wild, but yeah,
cold plunging, meditation, all that
[SPEAKER_02]: exercise, self care.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my spiritual practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I started having like an energetic
hygiene practice, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: My life really started changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prioritizing yourself sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to change the order sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I'm like, no, actually I can't
start work until I take my walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my mind is too busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pulling me in so many directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I just take my walk, I come back,
I find that I'm really able to focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're more productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to prioritize your people
need to prioritize for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, right now, especially,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking something out just for you,
whether, whether it's a walk or whether
[SPEAKER_02]: it's cold plunging or going to the gym or
what, or combination of all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's so many things you can
really do that are good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides your diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's important too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the weed's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These dabs are some of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were made by my buddy up in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary Payton times grape soda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary Payton is another good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Gary Payton a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like a lot of the strains that Ken made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm snowman.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The why.
[SPEAKER_02]: The why is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause in 2014, I have yet to see the why
life like it was in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some awesome crosses that
have been made with it and whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like.
[SPEAKER_02]: The why life, we used to get the why life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my friend, Stevie, my friend,
gold member.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to get the why life from San
Francisco, 60 bucks an eighth,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was like the high price back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd get some ounces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd get some ounces of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, but I haven't seen that sense
since, since yeah, that's 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like floral candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like smoking candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like as skittly as skittles and
skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that with floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, I couldn't get enough of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the things where I get like
an ounce of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just smoke that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I have 20 different things,
I'm going to smoke all that because I just
[SPEAKER_02]: keep going back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm like, that was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep going back to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also need cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The why is pie times cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pie times cookies was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had one thing that you could
tell yourself to your younger self that
[SPEAKER_02]: was first started out of the industry,
you could have, if you could tell them one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, what would that thing be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't pay attention to the smoke and
mirrors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many little fear factors and
like distractions and houses of cards that
[SPEAKER_06]: came tumbling down and you know,
just nothing was really as it seems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just like get really passionate about
whatever it is you're into and put your
[SPEAKER_06]: nose to the grindstone and just keep
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny that you say that because I
feel like most of the things I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was younger are not completely the
opposite, but they're never as they seem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perspective and perception are just these
amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get perspective over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you realize, wow, like I think
that suffering is not that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think people should suffer to a
degree so they can appreciate the good
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of parents,
they don't want their kids to suffer or
[SPEAKER_02]: have a hard life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think hard lives make some of the
best people and appreciation for what they
[SPEAKER_02]: have and being grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that from having tough times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pressure makes the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you really are just grateful for
all that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also know what you have and what
you had and the experiences really put
[SPEAKER_02]: life into perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every day, you know, I feel like as we
get older, years go by faster,
[SPEAKER_02]: every year goes by a little bit faster
because you know, a year when you're five
[SPEAKER_02]: years old is 20% of your life,
but a year when you're 20 is a 20th
[SPEAKER_02]: percent of your life, you know,
or 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you look at it like that,
it's as you're 40, that five becomes two
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so each year goes by so much faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think, you know, time, we got so
much time and really we don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is the end as far as
like existence, but we have a finite
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of time to do all the things we
want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no better time to do them than
the present.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They say, so if you had the luxury of
knowing that you were dying tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_06]: what would you do in your last 24 hours?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like, now that's how you should
live each day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always an amazing question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should ask yourself that every
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I would, I would go make amends
with like one or two people who may,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not that we're on bad terms,
but maybe we haven't talked but they're
[SPEAKER_06]: important to me, you know, family.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would make sure we're all good,
you know, knowing I would never see them
[SPEAKER_06]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd definitely go see my parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be the first thing I'd do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was raised by really good parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great parents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had our ups and downs and
arguments and stuff, but my parents were
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still are amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm blessed to have both parents still
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my dad passed in January.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I know that that's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's as you get older, like I
experienced the loss of my dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is one of the toughest things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've never had that, you probably
wouldn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we get older, we start experiencing
loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just, I imagine, you know,
that my parents are going to pass one day,
[SPEAKER_02]: which they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's a trip when you think of
those things and like what you would do
[SPEAKER_02]: with your last day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to say, you know,
I'm grateful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent so much time with him on his last,
you know, on his last days, on his last
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blessing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a blessing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm grateful because you can never,
ever get that time back.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, that's the one thing is you
don't get time back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go have new experiences,
but you don't get the old ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about good memories anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also about like recognizing what
are the moments from your past that are
[SPEAKER_06]: robbing you from your present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because those are the moments that should
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they're just taking up real estate,
real estate in your own mind, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love about psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like we have these filters
and I call them filters, but really some,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of them are traumas, but traumas
create filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these experiences, the moment
we're born, we see the world as we see it
[SPEAKER_02]: now because of all these experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our lenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: These lenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see this world in a specific,
our reality is this lens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we take psychedelics or we
smoke cannabis, I think sometimes it pulls
[SPEAKER_02]: those lenses or those filters off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you start seeing the world,
maybe not as how it really is to everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else, but how it really is and how it
should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like trauma is just such a bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've all experienced.
[SPEAKER_06]: With each one of those lenses comes like a
whole different belief system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of them are limiting beliefs
and those are what you have to let go of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you see them, you can let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: In all kinds of ways that I'll tell you
later, but like, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go into it now, but I've just been
doing this practice where you basically
[SPEAKER_06]: bring it into your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it into your heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the tool of five D, you know,
used to be the mind and the mind wants all
[SPEAKER_06]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really all about the heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the heart is such a high vibratory tool
that anything you bring into your heart
[SPEAKER_06]: gets neutralized.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anytime you notice a limiting belief,
you know, and one way you can find out
[SPEAKER_06]: this all came from this woman I've been
doing a coaching thing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: One way you can find out what they are is
you start describing yourself to like a
[SPEAKER_06]: friend, like pretend there was someone
here and start describing yourself and
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll start to notice these beliefs come
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you might say something like,
oh yeah, sorry, I smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always forget stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's a limiting belief that
cannabis makes you forget things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and you pull it into your heart
and then it leaves your life and it's not,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not holding you anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it neutralizes the contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not in agreeance with those
words anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Five D tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that earthing and just so many hacks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you don't have to do things the way
you used to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the beauty of today and
the now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the Maya in Whoopi and Maya and
you guys are doing some big things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Whoopi and Maya is Whoopi Goldberg's
vision for a product line for the moon
[SPEAKER_06]: cycle, moon cycle relief, all medicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, it's everything a woman wants on
her moon cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a bath, a herbal rub that has a
lot of different herbs in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a tincture that's also multi herb and
a rock a cow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started the company, I think seven
or eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like everyone else, we had our,
you know, set of challenges, which
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody in the cannabis space has,
and we decided to kind of pause it for
[SPEAKER_06]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we restructured and now we're,
we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so interesting because it's like,
wow, you know, sometimes opportunity
[SPEAKER_06]: knocks twice, you know, and not everybody
gets that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, and everybody loved the products
and everybody loved the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like to this day, we're still getting
requests for our products, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: and like serious people, like
endometriosis patients and stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're actually finding true relief from,
from our products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so I'm excited and grateful to like,
be able to do this again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on July 20th, which is Friday,
Saturday, Whoopi is getting her keys to
[SPEAKER_06]: the city for Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and then we're having a party that
night and she's going to be releasing,
[SPEAKER_06]: re-releasing Whoopi and Maya there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Emma and Clyde, which is her
flower line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: The brand will probably mostly be
licensed, um, to out-of-state partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know she's from New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like an important place for us to
be definitely East coast, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, of course California too, but everyone
who's been in California understands that
[SPEAKER_06]: there are some challenges with lots of
challenges, you know, so sad, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, that was, um, one thing I did want
to say when we were talking about Spain
[SPEAKER_06]: and all the social clubs was like,
you know, not to get political,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I really feel like Gavin Newsom like
dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: When he didn't let us have live music and
food and wine and espressos with like our
[SPEAKER_06]: weed, you know, so there's just no,
we're not able to have that culture yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the best cannabis and the best
wine and produce in the whole entire
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heartbreak, literally the heartbreak,
you know, we had the most potential to
[SPEAKER_06]: have such great cannabis tourism and farm
to table boutique vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said that he's against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't written correctly was his
cop out for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, like whatever it is,
dude, you dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we could have been flowing by now,
you know, we could have brought a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: money to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having place places where people could
consume and enjoy and enjoy other things
[SPEAKER_02]: along with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent and not be treated like
a criminal when you have to spend top
[SPEAKER_06]: dollar for some boofed out weed that had
to be like robbed of its terpenes just to
[SPEAKER_06]: make it to market the compliant way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heartbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a heartbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're solving those problems
as we, as we speak, like with refrigerated
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution and delivery and trying to
get the product to the consumer sooner,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think that's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the consumer and some of these guys
have amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about this on my last
episode, but there's amazing flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then you got to wait one or two months
to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's not amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The boof process, the boof process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're boofifying the weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you know, Alec has a really good
breakdown of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Alec from SC labs, you can
explain that whole process so well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get him on the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just feel like it would have
been such a vibe if you could like roll up
[SPEAKER_06]: to a farm and actually see on unmanicured
weed and jars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they bring out the little wooden
tongs and like hand cure it for you and
[SPEAKER_06]: then weigh it up for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, that real nice vibe where
you're getting something fresh and farm to
[SPEAKER_06]: table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it should have been more like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Considering like a couple flakes of trim
isn't anything anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, to micromanage it like that,
just like blocked all the flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I love the microbrewery winery model
that would be great for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with the terroir in Humboldt, you know,
Mendocino, Sonoma, Trinity, like all those
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you, you know, then you put the
farmers back, uh, you empower the farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: to do what they've been doing long before
most of the people they're doing it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can experience it with them
and hear the stories of how their
[SPEAKER_02]: grandparents were outlaws and bootleg
basically like bootleg figures and had to
[SPEAKER_02]: fight for the plant and do stuff that they
believed in, even though it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those people are the ones that should
be growing it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody is trying to find Maya and
they're looking to get ahold of you or
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to know more about you,
where can they go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at, um, get omeliving on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have a CBD website, which is
om-wellness.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then our THC website, which is
omeliving.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can find us in retails.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy our products online.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then yeah, Whoopi and Maya will be
back on the shelves shortly as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to collaborate on some stuff in
the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any formulation needs I got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, there's so many cool
things that I have the ideas for that I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't execute myself, but that's what I
love about the, you know, not to go on and
[SPEAKER_02]: on on the show, but I love that about the
recreational world and the legalization of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that we can be specialists and I don't
want to do everything anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a partner that does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to focus on genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to grow flour or be the guy
who changes, you know, the ACs out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we used to do everything back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can really be specialists and really
dial those things in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with technology, it's just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to be the Swiss army knife
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those were fun days too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give me more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did that cause we had to be private
so we couldn't just bring anyone in
[SPEAKER_06]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was much different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know, a lot of, you know,
cannabis people who were founders,
[SPEAKER_06]: like came from a time where we only hired
friends and family because that was the
[SPEAKER_06]: only safe way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to like step into these situations
where all of a sudden you have HR,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're like, Whoa, but I only know how to
connect with people by like rolling up a
[SPEAKER_06]: doobie, talking story.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they need one lunch, 30 minute lunch a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have a break in the morning or
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much for coming on
the show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so, so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
