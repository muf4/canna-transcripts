[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another episode of the James
Loud podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today, my special guest is Miami
Mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on, James?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, I'm glad to have you on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited to get you on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started doing the podcast planning,
I'm like, who do I want on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your name was one of the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been friends for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the class at Net-a-Fem
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was the first time we met.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a good group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Autumn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got a bunch of guys now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing his own thing with Smokin'
Mears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokin' Mears grew down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Plum Dogg Millionaire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plum Dogg's the man.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other people in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we had Keith from Spectral.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had an LED in there, too, in that
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I met James from Liberty
Chemical, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't at the class, but he was at the
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: About five years since we've known each
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for our guest, tell us a little bit
about your history in the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you got started back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started back in the day because all my
friends, well, I moved from Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved to Deerfield Beach or Pompano
Beach, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became a surfer, and all my friends were
surfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them were rich, and they all
smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was anti-weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were even rich, and they would still
sell weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck, man, I need to do that
because I was busting my ass being a
[SPEAKER_01]: busboy, salad boy, prep cook, cook,
construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, I just said, I'm going to sell
some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to buy a car or something because I
beat up cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I got into construction,
and then they wanted me to build stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I would build it, and then I would
get all the rights to whatever came out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that place that I would build.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got my start in the cannabis
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Miami back in the 90s,
2000s?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually Palm Beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we came from Columbia, we skipped the
whole Miami thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was straight to Broward County.
[SPEAKER_01]: North Broward County, South Palm Beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was around that area that all
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some... I mean, it's just luck of
the job, but we had some surfers that were
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had access to indoor back in 86,
87.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had friends in high school that would go
by this week called Crypto from this dude
[SPEAKER_01]: with long hair, a surfer dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name was Taco Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his nickname because yeah,
like a Mexican little restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the best weed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That weed to this day is still some of the
baddest weed that I remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some interesting things that came
out of Florida for example, Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see Oji Kush back in the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that something that went around as the
creepier?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Creepy is creepy to anybody that remembers
Seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That crypto was the original thing that we
remember as chronic Seedless stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people started growing more and more
and more weed in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cubans, they're beasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing all kinds of weed down
in Homestead in Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of sativas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of sativas, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of hazes, lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that was Seedless became
synonymous with creepy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little action of the creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that creepy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was Seedless.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was creepy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creepy could beat anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creepy could be whatever it was at that
time that you first started smoking that
[SPEAKER_01]: was Seedless.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the exotics of its day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the Cuban Black Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some in the other room and some
Piff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much almost the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that cat piss kind of leathery
rubber kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got pine and limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super musky, stinky, just kind of dank,
I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the effect of them too,
but they're long flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely not a commercial viable
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that takes longer than 10 weeks
is really hard to justify because nobody's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pay for what it costs to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're faded out on the commercial side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people that have bred the
Piff and other hazes into nine-week
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they did it back,
crossword to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some nine, 10-week strains.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The haze that I grow is the Mango Haze,
and that's a 63, 65-day strain haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It threw down too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, it was- Yours finishes
the one that you showed me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finishes in 63 days?
[SPEAKER_01]: 63, 65 days, that thing is done.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a late bloomer, starts slow,
and then it just puts its weight on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last couple of weeks, it definitely
throws some weight.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 63, 65 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got an interesting structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because we were just talking on
the last podcast I did about structure and
[SPEAKER_03]: appealing structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like those nested tight buds,
whereas that stuff is very open bud with
[SPEAKER_03]: the bracts that stack on top of each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very foxtail-y.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is looser than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mango Haze happens to be tight
foxtails, super bright, orange hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it wet terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It retains its weight when it dries out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have dry, wet flour with no leaf
on it and it dries, it usually dries
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere between 19 to 22% average.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mango is one of those that retains its
weight because it's like heavy oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like in the 20, 22%- It's greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't wash for shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a loser in the- In the wash,
but still, it's got its place.
In the wash, it's a loser.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for BHO, it's a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely throws down on that for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure smoking joints of it,
I can just imagine from smelling it
[SPEAKER_03]: yesterday, how it tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely got a- I mean,
there's some people- I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicks love the taste, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people that love the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people actually don't like
the taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could just tell by the smell of it that
it's probably pretty strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full flavor, but it's probably also
strong in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually test pretty low for THC,
like in the mid-25s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it anywhere from 23 to 26,
roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it definitely gets you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that just because
something's lower or in the high teens or
[SPEAKER_01]: low 20s doesn't mean that it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a different effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are just starting to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they'll ever figure it out,
James.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's in the cannabis game may
know it, but most people they just go
[SPEAKER_01]: straight to their store and they just look
at that percentage sign, and that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like tunnel vision, like a horse with
blinders, and that's all they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's 30 plus, they buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to change,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it changing in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it changing in Washington more that
people are relying on brands rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: just THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you have a good brand and you
have something that they trusted enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: try it, it's just going to take time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to take better products
with low THC on the market, where people
[SPEAKER_03]: are like, holy shit, it's only 22%.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's about flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor is like, I don't see anybody that's
going to a liquor store and goes like,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me see on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's got the highest alcohol level?
[SPEAKER_01]: 151.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the 151.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grain alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so soothing to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even alcohol, I like the pina coladas,
I like the strawberry daiquiris.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like a good pina colada.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the better drinks out there,
especially for tropical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if I was drinking at home,
I feel like I'm on vacation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets the mood going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Moscow Mule with some extra mint,
just a little kick of some herbs in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are just stuck in this high THC
thing, which I just, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, give me 151 or give me some,
what's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everclear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Everclear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The backwards stuff that they make in the
woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, give me some moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's just like fire water,
literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, the moonshine that comes right
out of the still, yeah, that's the fire
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you got good guys that make moonshine
and they dilute it properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They dilute it and put some fruit in it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going back to tasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and craft.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasting, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys that infuse it with apples or
oranges, citrus or something, whatever is
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making it their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what we need to do with
genetics too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're in this really
interesting place where everything is like
[SPEAKER_03]: purple candy gas gelatos, and that's going
to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The book market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it ain't candy gas, they just don't
want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do you make it your own?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like your mango string, your mango
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I'm getting ready to read that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are going to, over time,
will develop into popular things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just assume that will make
everything else, but we need those things
[SPEAKER_03]: because we need the diversity,
because taste is so subjective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like everybody says, I hate fruit or
I hate gas or I hate earthy, whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people, Baskin-Robbins got 31
flavors for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanilla or chocolate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry or some chunky monkey,
different palates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just love that flavor on
vanilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can eat an edible if you don't want
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say, I like Haagen-Dazs vanilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not infused with air, all these
briars and all this stuff, but I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: vanilla guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rum raisin, though, is actually better,
so there's some fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Italian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm big on the Italian style where they
don't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ruins the air, the overrun.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's fluffed out, it kind of dilutes
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ruins it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also different where it's
healthier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think gelato is healthier than ice
cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably real cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more milk and less cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or real milk or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and you eat it fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where's ice cream?
[SPEAKER_03]: You pull it out of the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think gelato, if you make it that day,
it's fricking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has this texture, a special texture.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you start mixing like
pistachios or this caramel or stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a place in Oregon that was
insane that made the most insane ice cream
[SPEAKER_01]: or gelato, and I forget what it was,
Vincent Feathers or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: some weird name, but they made the
weirdest ice cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day they were making that at Duck
Fat or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the best ice cream I ever
tasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Duck Fat ice cream sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, super creamy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hard stopper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I made gelato when I was in my 20s,
my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at a gelato shop for like six
months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gelato Milano in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really wanted to learn how to make
gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just amazing, the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have so much appreciation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get away from gelato,
can you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gelato then, gelato now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and now they're forcing the gelato
on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do like some of the gelatos.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 33 is super diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's a lot of amazing
stuff, but everything's gelato these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backseat gelato came out of something,
some kind of bag, and everything's just
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another backseat came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, backseat after backseat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all these evolutions that we're
going through these different stages,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all part of the process of
wherever we're going.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you call what the next fad thing is
going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think gas is coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I think gas and lime green.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking about lime green a
little bit with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think lime green has the potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: But gas, like old school OGs, and also old
school favorites that we're nostalgic
[SPEAKER_03]: about, those are going to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are saying the hazes are
coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I read somewhere, it might've been
an Instagram post from Mr. Nice Seed Bank
[SPEAKER_01]: that he says that in the last year,
he's sold more mango hay seeds than since
[SPEAKER_01]: he ever started selling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also what we have is we have the
increase in popularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so more people are trying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a larger pool of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more people breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more people buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a degree, although it's been a little
slow this year with seed sales retail,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that has to do with the
economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably say so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably say so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds aren't cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can see where that would
probably hurt the seed breeders a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit because people are not buying them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and there's so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just so many breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anybody can make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds aren't hard to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think breeders nowadays, they're not
like they used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, when I remember breeders,
I mean, they didn't have seeds all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time and they would work the line to,
it wasn't like, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: F1s or S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cross them and then you sell
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now they cross and they sell
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a potluck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like a lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff was held a lot tighter and you
didn't want to necessarily sell stuff when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're breeding or you didn't necessarily,
it wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like the sour diesel cut, we didn't
want the sour diesel cut to get out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't want to share the sour diesel
cut with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wanted any good cut to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you didn't want cuts to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna tell you, I paid 60 grand for
the mango cut back in 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 grand for nine little clones and a
recipe on how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I paid it back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you grew weed and you sell the
pine weed from anywhere from 4,000 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,800, whether it was one or 10,
it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you made your money back on one run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there on, it was all profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing back then is, you didn't
really have, you know, it was federally
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal in Florida to this day,
25 plants or more was through your minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: mandatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't want to mess with seeds in
Florida because you know, it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: potluck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to hit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit, you know,
and then you needed to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have this house, you spent all
this money on a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to hit from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing is back then, if you hit
from day one, you got all your money back
[SPEAKER_01]: and you made some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you grew mediocre weed back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your money back and made some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Times were so different in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just, I can appreciate
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a wild West.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, you were, you were doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're, you're building out multiple grows
and you were growing and doing all kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since 1996, since 1996, 95,
I started building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we, we grew our first crop in 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was a house, four lighter,
six lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bathroom was the,
the, the mom room and closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, it was all history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we just started, you know,
just gotten houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got houses, you put in, you know,
lights in every room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys fill them out to like 30 lighters
or were you doing like smaller,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 lighters, 10 lighters,
10 lighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then we would do them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would, they would flip, you know,
you know, 10 lights, sooner day,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 lights at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would, they would flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will be working 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you had to make the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you definitely did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had eight lighter and my friends wanted
to jump in or my buddy wanted to jump into
[SPEAKER_03]: a 50 lighter with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like 50 letters, nothing,
but you gotta go to a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were scared of warehouses in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floor is a little different because,
uh, you gotta jump the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, I mean, here in California,
you guys, yeah, you guys are spoiled
[SPEAKER_01]: because Sacramento, they turn you into,
I heard smud smud area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll, they'll, they'll point the finger
at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so in Oakland, how'd they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: They determined the green zone was by the
power.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went and looked at PG&E,
the highest use power areas where everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: was already growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where they put the green zone for
cannabis in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very supportive of the movement.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays it's just like, uh, nowadays with
these LEDs that you, we have now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, you can slam them on the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn that power way down and slam
on the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have the same PPFE.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a winner because you don't have to
tap anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a pretty good way to go about it
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got into the lighting game kind of
early, or I guess, not so long ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you got in with a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of by accident in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I got, I've, I've told this story
several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got raided in 2017, six months before
legalization in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was planning on going out West.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, well East from here,
West from Florida to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was invested into, uh, into a grow over
there that was kind of failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was buying some partners out and I
thought I was gonna, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: make it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got raided in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, in Orville, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I ran from, I spoke and I
had to reinvent myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to figure out how to, how to survive
and, you know, feed the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing more consulting because
I had started doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met this, this Asian dude in Oregon
at a trap that I was rebuilding and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, he liked me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's seen something in me and,
um, we started, you know, selling these
[SPEAKER_01]: controllers and I started giving them
feedback as a grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause they had a great product as it was
anyway, but it just needed to be refined.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the original Trollmaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before it was Trollmaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was Trollmaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Trollmaster already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was Trollmaster already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't any stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, back then it was in Hawthorne.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, Sunlight Supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrofarm turn them down in any other
store, turn them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the owner went up and down the coast
from door to door with pamphlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved from Hong Kong to LA and went up
and down the coast, just pamphlet after
[SPEAKER_01]: pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now he had some sales and the guy that
I was doing a trap for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up the pamphlet and told me we're
going to use this controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of against it, but it wasn't,
it wasn't my dog and pony show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you hand watering at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually hired me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was hand watering positive with this
big cocoa on a, on a, on a, on a pallet
[SPEAKER_01]: with casters on this makeshift stuff,
you know, and he wanted to get automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since my first grow in 1996, James,
I was automated, enermatic baby,
[SPEAKER_01]: enermatic with, you know, automatic
drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fuck when I was going to hold
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to learn how to
hand water.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning, you got to get away from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a contractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a contractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, no way am I going to see it
here counting to 10, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we automated everything for me from
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I, you know, somebody showed
me a grow and I said, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it better in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I didn't see, I didn't voice
that, but I, you know, you walk into this
[SPEAKER_01]: gross and, but, you know, and,
and they're the fence, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: contractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they're not, they don't,
they're not construction savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do the best that they can,
what they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as I walk into this base,
okay, I'll change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking around in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going, I'm not going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be the one better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually you have an automated
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was enermatic, but it still
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn on and off, turn on and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was so against
Trollmaster because I had this little
[SPEAKER_01]: controller that was smaller than an
enermatic time clock and it did
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you fucking kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the most, you know, technology
savvy guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I was scared of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you use 50 gallon drums to build your
stock tank back in the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have a... We, we use,
it wasn't, there weren't drums because I
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculated the feed back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do it the easiest way, so things
wouldn't break is we had a pump in these
[SPEAKER_01]: low, shallow, like, you know, 16 inch,
60 gallon reservoirs that sat underneath a
[SPEAKER_01]: long table and we top, top drip feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a gutter and then the gutter back
gravity back into, into the reservoir and
[SPEAKER_01]: we were circulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really only have to, you know,
rely on one pump and one timer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to, to, to activate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually, you know, it was,
it was technologically, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at that, for that time, you know,
high tech for that time, but it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was simple to the point that,
you know, it wasn't going to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, enermatic timer on off,
like a sprinkler outside, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: on off, on off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those ball valves were pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember my buddy at his grow,
we, we showed up, but he had the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the float valve to fill up the 50 gallons
and the, the, the float valve didn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: and the whole room was flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one is going to flood,
but you know, not if it's going to flood,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one is going to flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had, when we built grow rooms in
Florida, when, you know, the guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: taught me, we used to build self floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we did a self floor, we pitched it
and then we used, back then we used to use
[SPEAKER_01]: shower paint liners when they put
underneath the shower in a, in a second
[SPEAKER_01]: story home, you know, before, and then
they put concrete and then they put the
[SPEAKER_01]: tile on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to glue the shower paint liners
that would go on the, on the, on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the pitch floor up the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put some hardy, hardy board
that was painted, you know, the first one
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't painted and they got moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we say, okay, we got to paint
them, paint it, you know, the outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the inside of them were moldy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we painted all the way around when,
you know, the, the shower paint liner went
[SPEAKER_01]: up the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put hardy, hardy plank on the side,
and then we formed the whole rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we, the first ones were just the
close of foam aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we started painting them and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We graduated with using TPO, which is a
roofing, roofing membrane that needs 500
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees to seal it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there we went to just too
straight, you know, the rolling benches
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to that is if something ever
bursted, it wouldn't flood the house
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was a drain at the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would send it to the outside of the
garden or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys use wood rolling benches back
in the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did you, even from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, from the beginning, like I said,
from the beginning, we had a south floor
[SPEAKER_01]: and we started with, I think it was like
one, one gallon pots that were called a
[SPEAKER_01]: dog food, the hydrogen, hydrogen,
and then a three inch cube inside the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the one gallon pot with hydrogen and
with top feed and the feed to waste,
[SPEAKER_01]: feed to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd go on the, on, on the shower paint
liner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work its way down to the drain and then go
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I met the guy, the Cuban guy
that I bought the mango from, he showed me
[SPEAKER_01]: these benches that they, they had little
benches.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that showed me the benches
with the gutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had two by fours on cinder blocks
with a gutter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had soft hose that would go
like this in between leech trace,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Dutch leech trace, you know,
pitched at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had the little, little L's that
you put into the leech trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I'm looking at this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to absorb as much as possible
because I'm, I don't, you don't get to
[SPEAKER_01]: take pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only get to be there once,
you know, or they tell you whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said, well, I'm not going to
use bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm not going to use this hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to go like this because you
lose pressure, you know, piped on the back
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and then off shoots and then
spaghetti, spaghetti drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while you're evaluating this,
this grow as you're, as you're telling you
[SPEAKER_01]: about it or you're, or you're looking at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, before, you know,
when they look at your stuff, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, I should have never told this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have never told them,
you know, and, you know, you showed me
[SPEAKER_01]: once and it's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from then on, I just,
I just, you know, I just kind of do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: my own.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so going into the troll masters,
so that was in California, Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the troll master was actually Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up to Oregon to, um, to work for
six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I got raided, you know, I was
fighting this case and now I'm on mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was the figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to work and try to save as much
money, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To save whatever the shoe box had at that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got my ass kicked in a,
in that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know all about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you got, you know,
you're on your own people to treat you
[SPEAKER_01]: like your leopard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, everybody from, from the get go,
you know, you're a rat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't, you know, people said
that I got out the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit, I said, they kept this unweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept us in jail for 30 fucking days.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 days unweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a fucking lab, but they still,
I mean, people get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't let us because we're from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought they were going to get out
and then skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the wife says, Hey, I'm going to
bill you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm says, I said, no, don't bill me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been 50 K either too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to lose that 50 K.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a two million, two million,
two million dollar bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to, I don't want to lose 50
K.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, no, I mean, I know how the law
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer you sit in there, the lower the
bond gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I didn't, I didn't kill anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't an aggravated nonviolent
offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't, you know, I wasn't a
pedophile.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just knew in time the bond was going to
go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't, you know, they were going to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just didn't think it was going to be
30 days, but it was, it was 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they finally, uh, they finally,
um, let us out, you know, on a,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a lower bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I got out with it,
with it, with another guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to the bank because they
released my bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I got the other guys out,
you know, I got the other guys out and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, uh, then they wouldn't let us leave
to go to California, to go to Florida for
[SPEAKER_01]: four months, which was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had free labor from those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were staying at the farm and they
helped me deconstruct the 3000 square foot
[SPEAKER_01]: building and put it back to normal because
I had to sell that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to sell that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did constructed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold everything that was, that was not
strapped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I kept the 16, uh, 16 lighter as
a, as a, as a comeback hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like I said, I thought I was going
to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept the 16 lighter that I put in a,
in a, in a warehouse for like three years
[SPEAKER_01]: or four years waiting for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then it was a good time to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the comeback hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can come back with 16 lies and
then build a future from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can probably just, you know,
probably just pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know about a comeback,
but you can probably survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go good in the flower, if you do it
yourself, you know, with the new
[SPEAKER_03]: technology, you can get three pounds of
light of good flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were looking at those
undercarriage lights, uh, yesterday and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, what's his brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, uh, it was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Bobby bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, my buddy Justin,
he'd been talking about that for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time with his own version of it,
but like these lights, 200 bucks and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll retail 200 and you got one per four
by four and you're going to, he talks 25%
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even care if it's 10% yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it pays for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make the quality better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing since that place that I
got rated at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, I've been doing the side
lighting, uh, the Pacific light concepts
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me some, uh, some cobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next light gave me some,
some, some panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran them up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't, I don't think that I think
the LEDs were almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really weren't quite what they are
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a shit ton of LEDs and I'm
thinking, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these things are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to do with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, they had the cops over three
cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the wattage and it just says,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put them on the side of the
fucking walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lined up all these rooms with,
with lights like every so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a run and I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is they like, you know, some strains are
better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with all of it, it's since some
strains are better in CMH than they are in
[SPEAKER_03]: HPS or LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's some strains that have butt
sites all the way down to the rock wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like back then purple punch was
hot and I would have buds of purple punch
[SPEAKER_01]: almost this size right here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bad example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they pay for it is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not like to smoke it,
but people pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the biggest letdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of the first ones to have
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got blessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody stole the cut from somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like those hot women in LA that look
amazing and then they have no soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably more in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this guy calls me about it,
about a couple of points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found, obviously found this story about
it later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, it took a,
you know, took a whim on a whim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go out and he goes, well, where are you
at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when can you come get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, well, I'm on my way to Sacramento
airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, shit, I thought you were in
Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, he reached out to me because he
thought I was in Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, no, I'm in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he met me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the purple punch and, and I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, back to this LEDs,
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember about a purple punch
almost as big as this coming out of a rock
[SPEAKER_01]: wall like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, oh, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I called Pacific light concerts
and I ordered more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid for these next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just lined up the whole two
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I dropped HPS bulbs in the
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aisles and I caged them because
people, you know, guys or girls were
[SPEAKER_01]: burning themselves in the shoulders
because they were touching them or hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the yields just went through the
roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I had, I had upgraded from standard
HPS to these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I added this side lighting that
was on the outside walls and then the drop
[SPEAKER_01]: holes on the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it was just massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's giving an even amount of
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just tons of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD backwards back then, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just tons of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just knew that it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later on, after I think it was
2018 or beginning of 2019, 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was after I came back from
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built his amazing two car garage for the
guys, these guys in Santa Rosa,
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called the guy, um, cord,
which is, uh, he was part owner of Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: high concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Hey man, I'm looking to,
I remember those, those, those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those slices you gave me, I'm building a
garage and I want to make these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these custom panels, you know,
that I can erase up and down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: aisles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the other place was just long and it
was just two rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could put them on the outside,
but this one was several rows and you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to work in the aisle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how am I going to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, he goes, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll help you out, you know, so we'll do
some strips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of did some drawings and I still
have those drawings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, you know, uh, King Wooks,
um, side lights or something or hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess he was kind of, you know,
he's like a hash guy and now it's his
[SPEAKER_01]: nickname, you know, Wook, you know,
King Wook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call them King Wook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so anyway, um, I designed these panels
and then I went to a fabricator in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got this piece of aluminum metal,
you know, I gave him the dimensions he
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you know, I glued these,
these, these, I think are a hundred,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred watt sticks with Samsung LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and I put them on there with this,
with this tape that would allow the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to go into the metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I built these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, send me the whole kit to
be able to hook them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had side lights that would go
up and down in that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crushed too, for a two car garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I parked the range on the outside of the,
of the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the light just goes up and down nice
and slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, you, you put it in,
in place, you know, in, in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the walls, it was only one sided.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fixed to the wall, but in the
aisles, you would drop it, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you, you leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you had to go service the
aisle and you got a pulley, you pull them
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the way, you spray, you spread the
rolling benches and then you go service,
[SPEAKER_01]: you go defoliate water, you know,
whatever you want, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, you know, um, pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're done with the aisle,
you don't, you drop the lights and then
[SPEAKER_01]: close the benches and then go to the next
one and do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that, that garage is actually
operating to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I built it back in 2000,
I'm sure we're 2023 now, 2018 people,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, well, they didn't call, well,
they called him through my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe he's spending that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought I was still a rat at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're here at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly 2023 and they're still operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with the lights, what makes your
lights so special?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I feel like you have a special light
that's different than other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at first our lights were special
because he had the right spectrum and it
[SPEAKER_01]: had the best diodes in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and the controllability is second to
none.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the catch out of the bag, everybody
knows, you know, what, what, what good
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes are, what bad diodes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows that LM 301Bs were the,
were the, were the best diodes at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, uh, there's an H, there's an
EVOs, but they're so expensive nowadays
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's just not commercially viable to
go to those, to those, um, diodes because
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference is not that much,
you know, maybe for a small manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: lights it is, but not for a, for a big,
bigger company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the Osram reds is what we use,
but our controllability is king.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, people started to catch on that,
uh, you know, you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: control the, uh, the deep red,
you know, control the far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so they started adding that,
but, um, through this day, there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of controller and light that
work as good as the Trollmaster Hydrax Pro
[SPEAKER_01]: with the ThinQ LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now our lights have four spectrums and
they're all, can be individually adjusted
[SPEAKER_01]: to your liking and strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as you saw yesterday, when I brought
you through, uh, when, when you stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: by, uh, our place, I show you the test
that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of times people read Google or
read books or whatever it is and they get
[SPEAKER_01]: information and then you go to the next
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contradicts what you just read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that was the issue with me for
this last four years that I took a hiatus
[SPEAKER_01]: from, from growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was selling LEDs and I knew there
were really good, good LEDs, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I didn't really play with them
myself because I didn't have a personal
[SPEAKER_01]: grill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just on actually put all of this
stuff into, into, into, uh, I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: implementing all these tests myself
because I'm a, I'm a kind of person that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to prove it to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, all these things that I've been,
you know, they've been telling me that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the far red, you know,
will stretch, will shorten, will,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, will take off time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all fine and dandy, but I need to do
it so I can see it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can teach people about it and
tell them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first test that we're, what we're
doing yesterday is we, we, you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: there's pretty dark one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want you to stay there when
the lights went off so you could say,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's far red here and it's not really
light polluting any, anything in the
[SPEAKER_01]: center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it was important for me to show you
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, five minutes of far red
after dark and then the opposite side is a
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minutes after, after darkness,
you know, that, that the red stay on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it seems like it should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaved two weeks of a nine week strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it looks like something's going on
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, what we started doing here,
you know, we're going to do this the right
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going to do is we're going to
cut tops of somewhat the same size,
[SPEAKER_01]: same height away from the light and,
and the five minutes after dark,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the control subject, and then the 30
minutes after dark, and then we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to label them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was at, you know, uh,
50 days and three days later, do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another three days later,
do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to send all that
stuff to testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also look at them through the loop and
the loops are showing that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, at the end of the day,
you know, um, the test is going to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's a CBGA that's going to
tell you if, if, if that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you left meat on the bone per se or
not, you know, when it's fully mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, roughly,
um, we have to take that room to 63 days
[SPEAKER_01]: because the majority of the room was set
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if, if, if these two rows get too
dark, it gets too amber or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was what's going to have to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the environmentals in that room
were set to finish at nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so then we'll send those for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next round, we're going to do it to
where we expand our, our test subjects to
[SPEAKER_01]: five racks from one side, five racks in
another, there's 13 racks in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then three racks are going to be in
that, that are going to be the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to run that room to
finish the, the environmentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to run it to finish in seven
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should actually, what you seen
yesterday, it actually should be farther
[SPEAKER_01]: along because now we're, we're,
we're making the room colder, faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, we're going to drop the
EC, uh, you know, um, earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to, uh, you know,
lower the PPFD and the light, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually what we saw yesterday should
be actually probably even farther along
[SPEAKER_01]: and even more amber than, than what we,
we saw yesterday because the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentals followed the, the,
the timeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really, it's, it's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing is it's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you can't argue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny thing is like when you,
you know, like, uh, the, the other day,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, the director cultivation was
in there and then, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the PPFD is down on the, on,
on the, on the LEDs and you can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: dim an LED, by the way, you can't dim an
LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that you dim an LED is by,
um, it's flashes, LED flashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's on a hundred percent is just
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you started doing, let's say 90,
90%, it flashes off for super quick time
[SPEAKER_01]: and it comes back on the lower,
the dim, the off cycle is, is longer than
[SPEAKER_01]: the on cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how you dim an LED, believe it
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as well as really dimming is you're
talking to it, a Morse code per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when you're videoing, you see all
these little lines in the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, so I told the director of
collaboration, he turned his up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred because I want to do a video
because the lines were messing up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: video, the color, you know, you're doing
this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then their representation on the phone
is not the same as your eyesight.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're seeing this thing,
these things are fucking dull and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look over here, these are,
these are white, you know, still got white
[SPEAKER_01]: hairs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a visual thing when you're
there and, you know, it tells you,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, these things are really working.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so it's going to be interesting
to, uh, to do it the next time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, uh, and, and really be able
to have the science behind it and give
[SPEAKER_01]: people the feedback, uh, on, on,
on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've been doing a bunch of data
collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like from talking to you guys,
you guys collecting data on phenotypes and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're also doing some pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're doing some pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, something that I'm not used
to doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something new for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you're the expert on this,
on this, on this field, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first, like I said,
I've never, I think I, in my life,
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably count on one hand, how many,
how many seeds I popped until this last
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from like five seeds in my life to
like, you know, 520 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, it was definitely, it's an
adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then seeing these, these, these
different phenos, like, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: this one's tall and it's busting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one over here looks like a bonsai
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's like, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then you're doing the initial
growing from seed the first run.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your next run is going to be completely
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the stuff that looks a certain
way, when you grow up from the first
[SPEAKER_03]: clonal generation, it could be a
completely different expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could lose turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could gain turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could, you just get different things
as the plant matures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, sometimes they get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ask a lot of questions to, to,
to, to breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, this is not my field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by no means am I nowhere near if I can
expert or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ask questions and what everybody says
is just best, just clone everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, put it to the side,
you know, flip those, see which ones are
[SPEAKER_01]: your males, then go back to your clone
room and kill those or if you want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them, whatever, you know, but,
you know, get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you're left, you know,
what's everything is that you think is
[SPEAKER_01]: females, then plant those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way they all run at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, you know,
you have, you know, 400 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's take less, less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's going to take a lot less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in an automated system,
it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was best if they all grow at the same
speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I was going to have to keep
an eye just in case something throws a
[SPEAKER_01]: banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, they say that it gives you a
better representation of what that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant or that phenol is going to be
once you're start cloning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, I like getting rid of that first
generation because I don't want to see
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I can't have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like getting rid of the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just, I think that growing from
seed is great outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's obviously growing from
seed is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get bigger plants, you get a
taproot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're looking for what's the
long-term expression, cause you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep this alive in a clone form,
getting rid of that first generation is
[SPEAKER_03]: okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to, and it saves you time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to grow that out to see
it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get the first generation,
the second generation is you really got to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them out and you'll fall in love with
some.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next generation, you might
fall in love with some others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then third generation, it's like the
ones that are still amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are usually the ones you go for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'm in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody pointing me the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very, like very fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: The exploration side of it, like where
you're exploring different plants and you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a chance of winning the lottery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause technically it's a big lottery.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all playing the lottery trying to
hit that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lottery for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive as a lottery too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to the LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an expensive facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the most expensive, the most
built out facility I've ever been.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, it's the Lamborghini of
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that I went over and
beyond in building this thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the reason why this facility is so
nice is because we use it for tours when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was selling controllers and selling
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best, the best sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just show them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on by, come on by.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking to build something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to see how it's done?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, come on, come on, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny thing is that, like you were
saying about the LEDs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: started, you know, I got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The controllability on these LEDs is like
no other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then while I was building that
facility, a lot of ideas that the owner of
[SPEAKER_01]: Trailmaster had, and combined with my
ideas, we developed a lot of products
[SPEAKER_01]: while we were building that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID did throw a wrench on our spoke and
slowed us down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a lot of products that were
developed while the facility was being
[SPEAKER_01]: built, like, you know, the lifters or
something that he had in his mind for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually built prototypes and I
tested them, tested them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then gave him feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like the, there was a room that I
actually changed lights without even
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in there because there was a new
model that came out and I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to show it because,
you know, the facilities there is to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: products and sell products for
Trailmaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: When showing the Trailmaster's potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use the Trailmaster too in some of
my, I've used it in the past and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful in the sense that you can
control the lights too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dim your lights with the
Trailmaster on your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to dim the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down to 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can dim our lights down to 1% in
1% increments, which a lot of lights you
[SPEAKER_01]: can only dim down to 40%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I never thought of the Trailmaster
as scalable back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you go to your place and it's
like, okay, you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another reason why we,
we decided to do a facility and we,
[SPEAKER_01]: we decided to do a big enough to where we
can show people, hey, because trust me,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people tell me, yeah,
Q controller, you know, it's like Legos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice Q for the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used to make fun of me and tell
me, yeah, you keep building your little
[SPEAKER_01]: garages and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can look at them and says,
yeah, I gotta, I got like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, like a 600 car garage now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I grow weed in?
Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haters are going to hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day, all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, most of these haters,
you know where they're at, they're,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in Mount's basement somewhere
cause they don't have a life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had anybody come rag on me that
was doing better than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why, James?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're too fucking busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the time for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the fucking time for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody that, that goes on my page or
your fucking page and in case I,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what, they got time in their
hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ain't got nothing going in their
hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's a, it's a hard reality for
some people, but you know, it is what it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what they say?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hate on you, you ain't,
you ain't got nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't made any enemies along the
way, you probably haven't gotten there
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ain't doing shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your whole place is a family affair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your son working for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son, my son works for me and he was,
he was super sad to, to leave Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you know, Florida is a
beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to be able to go to Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back there sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're, we're a red state
Republican.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, California is very liberal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of red areas in the,
in the rural areas, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly Sacramento, you know, LA,
which is the same people in Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to Bakersfield and it's pretty red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all the rural areas are pretty,
pretty red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was definitely some adjusting,
but you know, the kid's young,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he, you know, he's in his early
twenties, you know, chasing girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: the beach, you know, playing volleyball in
the sun, you know, hot, hot water,
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take them to a landlocked place,
you know, he's depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what, you know, he's
depressed, but then he, he came into the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, you know, just like any,
any father and son, there's arguments,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's fights, there's yelling
and screaming, you know, and, but the kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kid, the kid came into his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he stepped up and he is the
go-to guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want any fucking questions to
answer about Trollmaster, go to my kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: because he way surpassed me on the,
on the Trollmaster knowledge on all the
[SPEAKER_01]: controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're young, they're very tech savvy,
super tech savvy, like push fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, dude, slow the fuck down,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, let me figure it out and
I'll tell you after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, talk to me through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just like, you know, pushing fingers
or is aggravating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he laughs, he thinks it's funny,
but, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then the other thing is
also, I feel like I tell people all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I walk around the building and go,
I don't even grow wheat anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow a business, I grow emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do make sure that I get out of my office
and I walk the rooms all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at the facility every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get involved, but at the end of the day,
you know, I run a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, if there's, if there's an
issue that they can't take care of or
[SPEAKER_01]: address, then, then I go and try to figure
out, but they, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kid just came into his own
with, with Trollmaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually, him and the owner,
him and the owner of Trollmaster now talk
[SPEAKER_01]: more than I do because he's the one that's
doing all the data and all the testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that is passed on to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he takes care of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that you can pass on to
him that you guys share and you guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: both passionate about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to him a lot yesterday and it's
really impressive what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's definitely came into his own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he likes, I think he likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he likes, he likes being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sees, I think he's, I mean,
kids have their own personalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one that's in college, that
graduated college.
[SPEAKER_01]: He graduated from law school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an attorney now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants nothing to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't go to strip clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other one is more like me,
you know, the mango doesn't fall far,
[SPEAKER_01]: far, far from the tree where he doesn't
level ground, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that he sees that, you know,
he's never, I sheltered my kids for a
[SPEAKER_01]: reason because I knew what, you know,
what we'd kind of the taboo, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it carried with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the time that I would carry,
I didn't want him to follow my footsteps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never did I realize that this stuff was
going to become legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I moved to a legal state, but,
but now he, he understands and he seems
[SPEAKER_01]: that transition from, okay, that's a mom,
that's a teen, that's a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if he goes to Florida for five days,
comes back, you know, he's eager to come
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like what we did, if we ever stepped
away from a grow room, we, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing you come back from a trip,
wherever trip, vacation orders,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first place that you go to is you go
to the grow room and then check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fucking exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe how big they got,
how fast they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's starting to see that and he's
starting to get the love for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of, kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, you know, he sees, uh, he talks with,
I hear him talk to his friends and
[SPEAKER_01]: showing, you know, showing pictures on
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's definitely developing a love for
the plant that, that we all develop when
[SPEAKER_01]: we were young and then growing up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he's going to evolve into someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, as far as his passion,
it's going to take him places that we
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't have even thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope one day, you know, he's,
you know, he's hopefully when I can say
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I'm getting old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, you know, take a, take a step
back here in a few years, once
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's running properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you know, I got,
I got, I got an awesome crew at the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got a great director
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, um, he puts his heart and soul into
the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't think I could have hired a
better guy for that role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's like me, he's, he's there early.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's there last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, you know, I feel, I feel guilty
if I don't go to work and sometimes I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: guilty if I leave, leave him there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I feel like I should be the one
that's closing the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but he's, he's, I'm, I'm very,
very satisfied with, with the guy that I
[SPEAKER_01]: got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then same thing with the director of
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all, they were both hired to,
to do their roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think they both do them well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think we got an awesome team,
you know, everybody, all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: managers that, uh, that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a happy environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a happy environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody does, does their job and there's
really no, no issues there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's pretty, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty happy with,
with everything, you know, can't complain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's gonna listen anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're like, you're pretty much a
workaholic when you're not on your phone,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're trying to build stuff and you got,
you got other projects going on too,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we are, we're, we're just getting
ready to open up the Mangotec store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happens to be about a mile and a half
from, from the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, another 20,000 square foot building,
roughly, uh, 6,000 of that towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: front of the, the space is, uh,
it's a showroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 4,000 square foot showroom and
then 2,000 square feet of offices where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to, we, uh, have salespeople
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be able to do light maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to be able to do
electrical drop maps for our, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the AC chain courts on, uh, on CAD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to do wind maps
because we've got a new fan line coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wind maps to figure out, you know,
um, we got a whole new fan line that was
[SPEAKER_01]: developed while this place was being
built, uh, cause some other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't want to play ball with me and pay
me commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became their competitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to pay me or I'm
going to, I'm going to compete against
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to be able to find a
partner that, uh, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can build stuff for me and,
uh, and then we can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and then the showroom is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The showroom is, is, is, is a one of a
kind first of his kind is like an Apple
[SPEAKER_01]: store, uh, hydra store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we don't sell everything under the sun
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we were, we're branded.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're focused on selling, uh, troll master
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think grow stuff and all our affiliate
companies that, that, that are with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to carry their products there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're going to, we're going to
showcase them and sell it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but the place is also,
there's also a 16 light custom grow room
[SPEAKER_01]: in that space, DPS panels and everything,
uh, grow glide racks, double tiered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be single tiered and I'm
going to put every single call it do
[SPEAKER_01]: Hickey that troll master has in those
racks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, the thought process was
obviously this has evolved as it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to put a tag with a QR code
and everything from the daisy chains to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to the, the flood detectors,
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are just, they're going to go
and say, I didn't know they made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know they made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go scan it with their phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take pictures, you know,
because they, the only place, the only way
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a tour of my facility
is if you can prove to me that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to spend about a hundred grand in my
store, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at the end of the day, you know,
I can't do a tour for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tour stay two, three, four or five
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I did a tour for everybody,
I wouldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that come to the facility are
either friends that I've had for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, they get a tour or they've
opened, somebody's opened the doors for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to their space or you're going to
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to buy, come on in,
let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many lights you want to buy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how many controllers you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get people from, from around
the, the city, the state, the country and
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world, they can come on in,
but this space, anybody can come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you don't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still come there and chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a little lounge area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see how this space is,
you know, like that place is built like a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facility and you're going to be
able to copy and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether as you have a one light in a room
and you can do whatever the best you can
[SPEAKER_01]: with the funds that you got the capital or
if you have a commercial facility that or
[SPEAKER_01]: a trap, whatever, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come by, check it out, you know,
and, and it's perfectly located,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, eighth mile off the 50 between
Lake Tahoe and San Francisco and between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Redding and like Salinas
roughly, you know, middle, middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure there'll be, I'm sure there'll
be many drug deals being done in that
[SPEAKER_01]: parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want 10%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you come inside and sit on
the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see the future of the industry
as far as lighting has made so much
[SPEAKER_03]: progress since 2009?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 12, 13, when it was the purple LEDs
and the, it was the worst, but ever the
[SPEAKER_03]: blurples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blurples from that to where it is now
is being the, the main focus for most
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, okay, we're doing LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cost effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see the industry going in,
you know, five years, 10 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we went over to that,
to that, I can't call a seminar where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where Bobby Bax was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The connect event, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where your throws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went there just, you know,
just check it out here out with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we've been trying to work
on for the last four years is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is some kind of side lighting,
inner canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it inter canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that's very hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to MJBiz last year and seen a bunch
of it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The side lighting or the inner canopy
lighting back then it was side lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: was something that we'll work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays is, is inner canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not, it's not under canopy
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under canopy lighting sits at the bottom
of your tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much level with the top of your
medium and the light shines up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that the light goes up into the
bottom of the canopy and then the top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the light shines up the bottom of
the canopy, it reflects, and then it hits
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of your leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's called a back show because it's
reflecting, it's hitting the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: your, bottom of your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants are absorbing the light
that's reflecting from the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to go a step better above and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we put our lights up in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A diode has 180 degree, I mean,
sorry, 120 degree spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then that's called a back show because
the light shining on top of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more direct, it's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a couple of prototypes and I
thought the last prototype was the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're going to go with, which I
showed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the last second, you know,
sometimes I leak Intel on purpose to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what the peanut gallery has to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got something to say at once,
there's always an opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you evaluate that information that
comes in, you know, everybody's always got
[SPEAKER_01]: an idea how they're going to do it better
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it's Intel that
you take, you evaluate, and then you work
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was going to be the last
prototype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up kicking like a little girl
and saying, no, we need to change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, by the time this thing,
this thing's been through projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a mold, there's this
thousands and thousands of dollars in time
[SPEAKER_01]: and hours that's been put into this
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't really want to scrap it,
but, you know, finally at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, you know, I take temperatures,
you know, and, you know, with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, leaf temperatures are touching
these sinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, some, some leaf might
be having a little burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, we're going to, you know,
I take pictures and I send, they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to get pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get nitpick for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get nitpick for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so then we, we decided to call the ICL
300 because it has a 300 degree spread of
[SPEAKER_01]: light, not just 180, you know,
they're going to go actually down and then
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can stack our lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of touching base on what you think
the future is, because that's what the
[SPEAKER_01]: original question was, is I think Bobby
Baggs was correct that in a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, people will have some kind of inner
canopy lighting or under canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: inter canopy lighting, because to build
another space costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the build out, the rent,
the time that, you know, say if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: this space, how can we squeeze more juice
out of this fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Inner canopy lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the fucking next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Justin, our mutual friend, Justin,
Apical Biotech, he, when I first met him,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was talking about this stuff and he was
like, you need to attach it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it'll go up with the trellis,
you know, the lighting that goes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I thought he was a little crazy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard every freaking suggestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is, but this was 2018 and I was
like, this guy's crazy a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because he has crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's super knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_03]: He thinks outside the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has some ideas where I'm like,
oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now, now like it's pretty,
you know, I think it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: standardized thing is eventually you'll,
we'll have a 100% and especially for
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the benefit even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than for indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll get more yield and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can harden up those buds that
are in the greenhouse where you have
[SPEAKER_03]: supplemental lighting, now you've got an
indoor product, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like an indoor product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll help to increase the quality of
like, you know, I love sun grown too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's like the perfect mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can do mix light.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of mix light.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little mix light action.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little mix light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that's, like I said,
Bobby, I think hit it on the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, people are going to
evaluate, wow, I can get another 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's right on numbers,
you know, 15 to 25% increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was right on a lot of things that
he said, you know, now you have A buds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have A buds that are not, you know,
they say purple or whatever color that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, color of the day or color of the
year or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have your B's and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you have under canopy
lighting or inner canopy lighting,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything becomes unified, uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the problem is going to be,
not a problem, but everybody's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: brag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the best pre-rolls because it's
all bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're not going to use the
micros for pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's using smalls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although some people, like the guys over
SF Canada, their smalls are just as good
[SPEAKER_03]: as the big nugs and they burn clean all
that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but yeah, it won't be like,
you won't get smalls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smalls is going to be a thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was talking about 5%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when it's all graded, you know,
if you did it right and you had the right
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, cause that's very dependent on
the genetics too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about our inner canopy
lights is that single tier, you run a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit taller plant than you do in
your double tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our inner canopy lights will be able to
stack, you know, on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have, and they're going
to shine up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really going to have light from
the tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't need a ton of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not talking about like 120 watts,
60 watts per side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really not that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a five foot tall plant,
you have light from the top coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have a light bar inside the
canopy that's shining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have another one up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have light from the bottom to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maximum efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also is going to require more,
more parts per million, higher EC
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had a bunch of good information in
there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And additional, you're going to have to
feed it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to feed it more,
a little bit more feed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: More transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: More transpiration, a little bit more
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's okay because you can handle
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can add a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add, you know, a little bit more
EC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got these serious dehumidifiers now to
handle that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously there's reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if people want it to go that way,
they can use the reheat in an AC unit if
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted to do that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely options,
but I think the easiest way to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: your money in a current space is going to
be the inner canopy lighting, hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of building another space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides having good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides having good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, good genetics goes with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, good genetics is- Everybody's
genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having good genetics is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all starts from that seed at some point
in life, but it starts from the having
[SPEAKER_03]: good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you don't have good genetics,
it's hard to get, I mean, you can't get
[SPEAKER_03]: good weed out of shitty genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either got to have good genetics,
good seeds, or you got to have friends
[SPEAKER_01]: that give you good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's somewhere along the line-
Sometimes you cheat and you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey man, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, I got this for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics is everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, I feel like
genetics is what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're in the genetics race right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's trying to get their own new
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, even if you're not a breeder,
you're an in-house guy and then you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little appalling, you have a reversal plan
and you go start touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you might not be getting a jar of
seeds like this, but you get 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, 30, 40, 50 seeds out of a branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to put pollen on a branch and
then you're an in-house guy, you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was talking to one of my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to Mojave Richmond and we
were talking about cultivars and how many
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars there are in the United States
right now in rec.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's somewhere between 35 and 5,000
different named cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a lot of the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then worldwide, 20,000 different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's way more than any other plant
species that's been domesticated,
[SPEAKER_03]: available for commercial and retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know
if any of you guys have sat down and made
[SPEAKER_01]: a forum page, whatever internet page that
shows every single name of strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, there's so many strains
nowadays that it's hard to come up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw them coming up with names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw them coming up with names.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Director of Cultivation that works for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Chad GBT.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Director of Cultivation that works
for me, he's great at coming up with
[SPEAKER_01]: names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just spat that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking for three days what to
call something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just spit it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed Finder EU is the place where you go
for all the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the closest thing we really have now
that I think is an organized list of
[SPEAKER_03]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you cross two strains and you
come up with a name for something,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then XYZ person over there crosses
same strains or two different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go one problem at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it crosses the same strains and
then causes the same thing by accident or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What takes precedent?
[SPEAKER_01]: What takes precedent?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is the question of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: People come up with the same name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's so many names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Betty, for instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I named something Black Betty.
[SPEAKER_03]: This other fucking guy named something
Black Betty too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was probably someone else that
named it before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of take credit for anything
until you get it trademarked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, until you have a trademark on the
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't trademark the strain either
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but you can trademark the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can trademark the name in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a state level, you can trademark stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, if we're looking at it from a
legal standpoint, if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: clout and all these other things,
that's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The perfect example is Rainbow Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kana Organics came out with Rainbow Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working with Tim and Kyle and
there's Rainbow Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally Rainbow Runts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then literally Mike from Exotic comes
out with Rainbow Runts and sells it
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's obviously way bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's like Rainbow Runts and they
think of his.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim and Kyle renamed Rainbow Runts,
Rain Shadow Runts, which is the Skittles
[SPEAKER_03]: times Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's different, completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be Rainbow Runts by Exotic as
opposed to Rainbow Runts by that in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this kind of stuff happens unless we
have trademarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way to really... If you
have it trademarked and it's your shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you've paid the money and you can
enforce it, too, if other people try to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it on the commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we're talking outside of rec,
that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tough to enforce things nowadays
on something that's kind of regulated but
[SPEAKER_01]: not regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no banking, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if these guys that are trapping,
they read and they call something.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of this stuff becomes big on the
black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to find those people and
send them a cease and desist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you can't call that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the strain that I created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working years and I paid all
this money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting trademarks and implementing
them in every state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, enforcement's the most expensive part
about getting a trademark if you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: enforce something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had some guys in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were selling vapes with Miami Mango.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody sent me a thing and I'm
like, fuck, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you've got to send it to the
attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the attorney's gonna go, five,
six, seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you love lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sue me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the little bitches and they started on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I talk a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, but that's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk a lot of shit on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's my page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't call anybody out in
particularly, I just say a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't say, James Lau hand waters,
he's this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah, I hand water.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make fun of a group of people because I
sell automation equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I sold a fucking hose, I would say
automation sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sell salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I sell liquid fertilizer that is
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jay first, you know, synthetic
fertilizers, I make fun, let's say of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, organic stuff, even though I got
friends that grow great organic weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, and then vice versa, but I sell
salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to make a meme.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get so hung up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get, they get, they get so caught up
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get, they get angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talk shit on my page, but I sell the
products and then people get hung up on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they hate on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never met me a day in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably go out and have a beer
and hang out, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they get so caught up on this because
they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's those people that say,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, mango for, you know,
your means just got to me and finally,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I made the change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I talk a lot of crap, but like I said,
it's generalized to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these guys come on my page and
then they, they, they attack me,
[SPEAKER_01]: attack my products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never go on your page.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take it real personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Instagram isn't the real world guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not one fucking bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a piece of the world, but it is not
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people live in it as if it is the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there's a whole world
outside that man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they come at me and then they
attack me on my page, then, then,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, then I start, you know, going back at
them and then they, they push back and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I started making memes at them
because, you know, then I got time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I sit in my truck and just
fucking play.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I am the boss of the company so
I can sit in the truck and make a meme if
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't clock in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then they, uh, they start feeling
it and then people start, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they call them the mango minions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start, you know, you know,
joining in and then they start feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: threatened if they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're getting poked and then,
uh, give me your legals, bro, because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to sue you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to feel me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, okay, well we went to fucking court
and then I guess, yeah, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got smart and then I, I attacked your
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to entertain your,
your case, your seven counts that you try
[SPEAKER_01]: to sue me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm frivolous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I attacked your addiction and,
um, and that was that, but it cost me a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking bunch of money to, to,
to go fight that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost me a ton of money to go to court
and they know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They fucking know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they call themselves that they have
in-house attorneys and it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, their partners is a, is,
is a law firm because I know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney that sued me, that filed the
paperwork, my attorney is not dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes and sees the guy, runs the name,
you know, she, if he's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a legal attorney, who he works for,
if he's, you know, we got, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, what firm he works for, they,
they do all the due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they assess the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you assess your, the people
you're going to go battle with and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, um, attorney that was suing me,
that was an in-house attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't the same attorney that was suing
Lux or HLED.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's partners with a law firm and they,
uh, it's cheap to them to drag you into
[SPEAKER_01]: their state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not cheap for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not cheap for me, but we,
we, we did this my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fought jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a chance to appeal and they,
um, they decided not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they realized that coming to
California, the, what they were suing me
[SPEAKER_01]: for was a lot tougher to enforce in
California, a lot tougher than force that
[SPEAKER_01]: they knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their attorney probably told them,
it's just best if you probably don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to cost them money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now they're going to have to hire an
attorney in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's, you know, cause not an
in-house attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they, they, they just decided to go
away, but I'm sure they, I don't know at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point, I'm sure he's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to try to find something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know whatever wild times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This reminds me of like California or,
uh, it reminds me of Florida Sioux state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, it's like everybody
wants to sue everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would, it's, it's the day and age,
unfortunately, when I grew up,
[SPEAKER_03]: we didn't sue people, you know,
no, no, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You freaking kind of dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember my dad talking about
suing people ever, you know, but people
[SPEAKER_03]: would fight back then too, like with this
instead of like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people fight nowadays too with
megaphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a, those got flagged on
Instagram for bullying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the biggest bully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people are interested in finding
more about what you do, where would they
[SPEAKER_03]: go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you got a bunch of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: These just would find is through that,
through the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, w w dot man with tech dot
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, go in direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ship worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ship worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, they can, they can,
they can, they can find us or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, we were working on a website
should be a release for the, for the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to have it up before we can,
we can sell to that, to the rec market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got some good genetics too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a flamingo runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flamingo runs is a great cut of runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, and that food cheese,
another is another, uh, good, good strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, it's, it's got the right
colors, got the right nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smokes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, people telling me that the,
that we smoking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the director of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing a fucking great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he loves working there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes working there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you've seen the improvement
from the, from the first time that you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you, so from the first time it's like
night and day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was a little rough in the
beginning and it always is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the rooms were rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some of the rooms were rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like I said, I took a hiatus from,
from growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well also you're at a big scale too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're at a whole nother scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new place with all kinds of new
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, new technology, technology that,
you know, that a lot of people have even,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, played with, you know,
the nano bubbler, you know, LEDs are bad
[SPEAKER_01]: ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a hiatus from growing, you know,
personally, even though I sold,
[SPEAKER_01]: sold, uh, sold LEDs, there's new,
uh, way of irrigation came about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, you know, crop steering that I
know fucking clue about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I recycled feed back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you, um, I actually paid a
couple of people to come and consult for
[SPEAKER_01]: me and tell me about crop steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of different people was like,
you know, you, you want to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of different, you know,
aspects of your views, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you kind of, you know,
start playing with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I tell you, every fucking room is
different because some rooms are just
[SPEAKER_01]: super charged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that the air flows, the way that
the AC is working too much AC,
[SPEAKER_01]: less AC, a lot of wind, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get all this information from,
from people that been doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everything is going to work out
slightly different in your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to learn that, you know,
there's, there's, you can't buy experience
[SPEAKER_01]: from fucking anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I tell my kid all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to figure stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put the time in, do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put the time in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, yeah, so I'm glad that you
came, you got, you got to come back
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday and we got, um, it was a great
tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I redeem myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You redeem yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come here, come here, come into this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: So different, so different and very even
canopies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'd say your canopies are super even,
especially compared to before it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: but these are all learning curves and
everybody goes through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a grow and you want to get
better, it just, it, it happens over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the different size canopies also,
like when we started this thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: we started with 63 strains and against
that's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you had to throw everything in there
and then the director cultivations going,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, I can't believe I can't believe
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go, we've got to figure out what
they like, what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's just figure out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fucking, we can put stuff to the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great doing a handful at a time,
but you got a 63.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like so hard 17 cultivars,
you know, 2000 to 21, 2200 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had 17 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing is that we kind of figured
out, we kind of knew the ones that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hit and we, we, we bulked those
in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the room did okay, but overall the
yields and the ratios from A to Bs to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to smalls and micros was, was a little
whacked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then we, we, we, we've turned a
corner by far and then we see the light at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely going to get better from
this point on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to get the inner canopy
lighting though in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I look forward to getting a tour
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody's looking for you,
they can go to your four Instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: accounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly it's the mango 2.0 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Miami mango, Miami period mango
1.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main account.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that everybody follows.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been getting deleted a lot over the
years, but now it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got, I got a guy that I paid a
good bring my account back, but eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: they disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's the one that everybody
follows that everybody complains about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they love to follow because it's the
most controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Miami period mango 1.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is Miami period mango period
Kelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other, that's the backup to
the, to the fuckery account.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now professional accounts where you don't
see no memes, no personal shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: no cursing is Miami period mango period CA
for either California or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the actual official Instagram page
for the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Miami.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's mango tech that store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the store's Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put push controllers and there's
that's another professional page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, there's some people that say
that there's not professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at my blog page.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's supposed to be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what I'm about, you know,
I say it like it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have fun with it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, I think that's part of
the beauty of it is you have a lot you
[SPEAKER_03]: could tell if, if you actually follow it,
you can tell that you have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very big expression of yourself.
